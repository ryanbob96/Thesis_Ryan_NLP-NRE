       "'THE\\n\\nAMERICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE\\n[FIFTH SERIES.]\\n\\n———_#oe\\n\\nArt, VI.—The Thermal Conductivity and Compressi-\\nbility of several Rocks under High Pressures; by\\nP. W. Brineman.\\n\\nINTRODUCTION.\\n\\nThe effect of pressure on the thermal conductivity of\\nrocks has apparently never been determined, although a\\nknowledge of it is important in calculating the thermal\\nequilibrium of the earth’s crust. The only measure-\\nments we have that can give any idea of the possible\\ninfluence of hydrostatic pressure are on the effect of one-\\nsided compression on the thermal conductivity of granite\\nand marble.t It1is of course well known that a one-sided\\ncompression need not be at all like a hydrostatic pres-\\nsure in its effects, and the only conclusion that we can\\ndraw from the experiments of Lees as applied to condi-\\ntions within the crust of the earth is that the effect of\\npressure is probably not very large. .\\n\\nIn connection with my work on the effect of high pres-\\nsures on general physical properties of various sub-\\nstances, I have recently been engaged in measuring the\\nthermal conductivity of-a number of liquids up to 12000\\nke/em?. Since the apparatus could be adapted without\\nmuch trouble to measure the effect of pressure on the\\nthermal conductivity of those solids whose conductivity\\nis not too high, such as the rocks, I thought it of interest\\nto make a few measurements from which at least the\\ngeneral trend of the effects to be expected could be\\ninferred. I have been encouraged in this attempt by\\nthe interest and advice of Professor R. A. Daly, who also\\nwas so kind as to obtain several of the materials for me.\\nI also have to thank my assistant, Mr. H. B. Curry, for\\nmaking many of the readings.\\n\\n1For references see the end of this article.\\n\\nAm. Jour. Scr.— Firtx Sreriss, Vou. VII, No. 388.—Frpsrvuary, 1924.\\n6\\n 82 P., W. Bridgman—Thermal Conductivity and\\n\\nIn addition to the thermal conductivity I have deter-\\nmined the compressibility of the materials used. It was\\ncomparatively easy to do this as the apparatus had\\nalready been developed for another purpose. When I\\nbegan these measurements the important paper of Adams\\nand Williamson? on the compressibility of rocks had not\\nappeared, and such questions as that of the change with\\npressure of the compressibility of a rock had not received\\nan answer. Since the appearance of that paper, my\\ncompressibility results lose some of their novel interest,\\nbut there are still a number of points in connection with\\nthem which I think may suggest new lines of thought.\\nIn the first place, I have measured the compressibility\\nof several of my materials at two temperatures, neither\\nvery high it is true, 30° and 75°, but nevertheless suffi-\\nciently far apart to give an idea of the variation of\\ncompressibility with temperature. This of course is\\nimportant when applying results obtained in the labora-\\ntory at room temperatures to actual conditions. The\\nnecessary information can not be obtained from the\\nresults of Adams and Williamson because their compres-\\nsibilities were measured at only one temperature. In\\nthe second place, my method, which measures the linear\\nas opposed to the cubical compressibility, brings out the\\nimportance of non-isotropy, as the measurements of\\nAdams and Williamson on cubical compressibility can-\\nnot do. I have found surprisingly large differences of\\ncompressibility in different directions, and also entirelv\\nunexpected and abnormal hysteresis relations. Both\\nthese factors are of importance in calculating the velocity\\nof propagation of earthquake waves or other deforma-\\ntional effects in the earth’s crust.\\n\\nThermal Conductivity.\\n\\nThe Method.—The method used for measuring thermal\\nconductivity is essentially the same as that used for\\nliquids, and is deseribed in detail elsewhere;? a brief\\nsummary here will suffice. The material whose conduc-\\ntivity is to be measured is worked to the form of a cylin-\\ndrical shell, which is slipped between an outer and an\\ninner cylinder of copper, each of which it fits accurately.\\nAn insulated wire stretched along the axis of the inner\\ncopper evlinder carries an electric current, so that the\\n Compressibility of Rocks under Pressure. 91\\n\\nentertain the possibility of the conductivity being several\\nfold greater than the accepted value.\\n\\nPyrex glass does not depart from the average crys-\\ntalline rock in the effect of pressure on conductivity,\\nalthough the absolute conductivity is lower, as is usually\\nthe case for a glass.\\n\\nCompressibility.\\n\\nThe normal behavior of compressibility is as follows.\\nWhen a homogeneous isotropic solid is subjected to\\nhydrostatic pressure it experiences a uniform change of\\ndimensions in all directions, so that the geometrical\\nshape of any part of the solid is unaltered; this change\\nof dimensions is a function of the pressure and tempera-\\nture only and does not depend in any way on the past\\npressure history of the specimen. In other words, there\\nare no hysteresis, elastic-after-effects, or allied phenom-\\nena, but the strain is a single valued function of the\\npressure. The percentage change of volume for a given\\nincrement of pressure in all cases hitherto examined\\nbecomes less at the higher pressures (that is, the com-\\npressibility decreases at high pressures), and in nearly\\nall cases, although not universally, the compressibility\\nis greater at higher temperatures.\\n\\nFor the materials of this paper, this simple type of\\nbehavior is not always followed, but there are significant\\ndepartures. To exhibit these, it will be best to describe\\nthe results in detail.\\n\\nPipestone.—The first sample of this which I measured\\nbehaved in a way which was in one respect the most sig-\\nnificant and striking of any of this series. The experi-\\nmetal results are plotted in fig. 3, which shows the\\nobserved fractional changes of length against the corre-\\nsponding pressures. In the first place the change of\\nleneth is not a single valued function of the pressure but\\nthere is a very marked loop, in shape like the well known\\nhysteresis loops of magnetism or the stress-strain loops\\nof a substance stressed beyond the elastic limit. The\\ngreatest width of this loop was 18.2% of the maximum\\nchange of length. This loop is not a temporary phenom-\\nenon obtained only on the first application of pressure,\\nsuch as I have sometimes found, and which may be\\nexplained by flaws or crevices which are squeezed tight\\n 92 P. W. Bridgman—Thermal Conductivity and\\n\\nby a high pressure, but it is a legitimate and permanent\\neffect, which may be repeated, as this specimen had been\\nsubjected to a previous pressure seasoning. The two-\\npoints in fig. 3 which appear to be off the curve, at 1000\\n\\nand 10000 kg., were obtained by a slightly different pro-\\ncedure than the others, the 1000 point after a release of\\n\\nFie. 3.\\n\\nerrprepryport :\\none BESET ALE oa\\nsee cen he ETT |\\neecuaetel tadpi AP.\\n\\nTH fas\\nseated\\n\\n, iam\\nt rh E\\n\\n{ ET\\nac ene\\nSphere\\n\\nTt\\nttt\\n\\nomen ie .

Experi-\\nence with other lag effects would lead one to expect these\\npoints to lie off the curve in exactly the way found, and\\nthe fact that they were so found is confirmation of the\\nlegitimateness of the effect.\\n Compressibility of Rocks wnder Pressure. 93\\n\\nApart from the existence of the loop, the second sur-\\nprising feature is the direction in which it is described.\\n‘‘Hysteresis’’? means a lagging behind, and this suggests\\nin general the physical reason for the effect. Normal\\nhysteresis would demand that when pressure is released,\\ncoming from a higher value, for example, the change of\\nvolume does not assume the value appropriate to that\\npressure, but lags behind, assuming a value to be found\\nat some higher pressure on the ascending branch of\\ncurve. The physical reason is usually sought in internal\\nfriction or in some inherent small-scale instability except\\nwhen in one of two extreme configurations, as is best\\nuUlustrated in Ewing’s theory of ferro-magnetism.\\n\\nThe phenomena found here are the exact reverse of\\nnormal. On the descending branch of the curve the\\nchange of volume is that to be found at a lower instead of\\nat a higher pressure on the ascending branch. In other\\nwords, instead of this being a lag phenomenon, it 1s a\\nphenomenon of advance, and the loop is a reverse loop.\\nI have sometimes found effects like this, but only in com-\\nplicated systems in which the explanation can be found\\nin the interaction of a number of unlike phenomena, and\\nnever in such a marked degree as here. It is probable,\\nJ think, that there must be a complicated state of internal\\nstrains to account for such a state of affairs. An arti-\\nficial mechanism may be imagined, which may have some\\nrelation to the actual mechanism, which will give effects\\nof this kind. Suppose the solid contains a number of\\nlenticular cavities provided with a valve mechanism such\\nthat liquid can get from the outside into the interior only\\nwhen the pressure outside is in excess of that inside by a\\ndefinite amount, and similarly liquid can pass from the\\ninside out only when the pressure inside rises a definite\\namount above that outside. When fluid pressure\\nis applied to such a cavity, the first effect is to\\nsqueeze it flat, but when pressure rises high enough,\\nliquid penetrates to the inside and the cavity swells,\\ntending to resume its natural lenticular shape. When\\nthe external pressure 1s now removed, the eavity first\\nswells because of the volume expansion of the liquid\\ninside, but when pressure outside has decreased to a\\ncertain value, liquid comes out from the interior and the\\ncavity shrinks. That is, such a mechanism has an abnor-\\n 94 P. W. Bridgman—Thermal Conductivity and\\n\\nmally large compressibility during the initial stage and\\nan abnormally small compressibility during the final\\nstage of a pressure increase, with the reversed behavior\\nduring decrease, which is exactly the behavior of the\\nrever sed loop found above.\\n\\nThe importance of this effect in speculation is evident,\\nfor it is a consequence of it that the initial elastic con-\\nstants for small stress differences of a substance like\\npipestone may vary by a factor of more than two-fold,\\ndepending on the past stress history of the material.\\nFurthermore, the mean elastic constant will vary greatly\\nwith the magnitude of the deforming stress or the defor-\\nmation, so that it may be quite differ ent for the strains\\nwhich we have in tidal deformation and those found in\\nmountain building, for example.\\n\\nThe effect is so important that it seemed worth while\\nto verify it on other samples. Accordingly another\\nspecimen was tried in another apparatus, in order to\\neliminate any possibility of instrumental error. This\\nsecond specimen was measured at 30° and 75°. The\\neffect was again found, but much less in amount, the\\nwidth of the reverse loop being at 30° only 3.1% of the\\nmaximum effect, and at 75° 2.3%. The sample used with\\nthe second apparatus was a short rod about 2.5 cm. long,\\nwhereas that used with the first was 15 ecm. long. To\\nfurther make certain freedom from instrumental error,\\na piece 2.5 em. long was now cut from the first sample\\nand measured in the second apparatus at 30°. This\\nendeavor to ensure freedom from instrumental error was\\nreally quite superfluous because the identical apparatus\\nhad been used in measuring the compressibility of\\nmetals,’ whose changes of dimensions are much smaller,\\nwith no hysteresis or similar effects of as much as 0.1%.\\nThe effect was again found; the loop was again reverse,\\nand the width was 11.4% of the maximum. The shape\\nof the loop was not as regular as that found before, but\\nwas as indicated in fig. 4.\\n\\nIt is evident that the pipestone is not at all a homo-\\ngeneous material but that different parts differ greatly\\nin hysteresis effects, and presumably in internal strain.\\nAlong with differences in hysteresis goes a difference in\\nthe absolute compressibility ; the compressibility was\\nconsiderably less for the piece that showed large reverse\\nhysteresis. The following results were found:\\n Compressibility of Rocks under Pressure. 95\\n\\nFor the long rod with 18% reverse hysteresis the aver-\\nage linear compressibility between 0 and 12000 kg/cm?\\nwas at the rate of 4.34 X 107 per kg. For the short piece cut\\nfrom one end of the long rod the average change of length\\nbetween 0 and 12000 was at the rate of 3.87 X 10%. The\\nreverse loop of the other specimen was so narrow that it\\n\\nFia. 4.\\n\\nFic. 4.—The compressibility cycle of another sample of pipestone, change\\nof length against pressure. Again the direction of the loop is abnormal.\\n\\nwas possible to draw an average line half way between\\nthe ascending and descending branches of the curve.\\nThe change of length as a function of, pressure on this\\naverage line is given by the formulas:\\n\\nAZ\\nT = 6.50 x 10~\" 9 — 6.81 x 10-”* p? at 30°,\\n\\nGQ\\n\\nAl :\\nT= 6.89 KX 107 p — 5.81 X 107\" p’ at 75°.\\n\\nThe average linear compressibility of the specimen with\\nhttle reverse hysteresis is thus 50% greater than that of\\nthe other. Itis not to be expected that the compressibil-\\nity of material of this kind is the same in every direction,\\nand therefore the volume compressibility cannot be com-\\nputed from the linear compressibility in a_ single\\ndirection.\\n\\nIt is to be emphasized that the abnormal behavior of\\n 96 P. W. Bridgman—Thermal Conductivity and\\n\\npipestone may be expected to represent a lower rather\\nthan an upper limit to the abnormalities of the materials\\nof the earth’s crust in situ. For this piece of pipestone,\\nmeasured in a laboratory, was a small piece whose\\nexternal surfaces were free from stress, and in which\\nany internal strains must have been fairly small, because\\ndue to the differential strains in a small mass. The\\nrocks in the crust, however, are subjected to shearing\\nstresses up to the limit of their strength, and the stresses\\nvary greatly from place to place, so that the internal\\nstrains, and therefore probably elastic abnormalities,\\nmust be high.\\n\\nSolenhofen Iimestone.—This material was in the form\\nof a rod 10 em. long and roughly 6 mm. in diameter, cut\\nwith the diamond saw from the same piece as the thermal\\nconductivity cylinder. Its compressibility was measured\\nat 30° and 75°. At both these temperatures the same\\nreverse hysteresis was found as for pipestone, but much\\nless in amount. At 30° the width of the loop was 6.4%\\nof the maximum effect, and at 75° 2.4%. The effect\\ndecreases with rising temperature, as it did also for pipe-\\nstone, but by a much larger factor. A decrease with\\nrising temperature is what would be expected if it is an\\nInternal strain effect.\\n\\nAt 30° the average volume compressibility between 0\\nand 12000 kg/cm? is 0.0,1838 per kg., and at 75° 0.0,1392,\\nassuming equal compressibility in all directions. If the\\nmean compressihjlity is taken from a curve drawn half-\\nway between the ascending and descending branches of\\nthe hysteresis loop, then it will be found that the mean\\ncompressibility decreases with rising pressure, as is nor-\\nmal. The departure from linearity, which is about the\\nsame at both temperatures, is such that at 6000 kg. the\\nactual change of volume is about 4% greater than would\\nbe calculated by using the average compressibility\\nbetween 0 and 12000.\\n. Adams, Williamson, and Johnston’ found for the mean\\ncompressibility of CaCO, between 2000 and 10000 kg.\\n13.6 X 107, and found no variation with pressure. Their\\naverage figure agrees surprisingly well with the mean\\nvalue found above for limestone. :\\n\\nBasalt.—The sample used was about 2.5 em. long, and\\nwas the core of the thermal conductivity cylinder. It\\n Compressibility of Rocks under Pressure. 97\\n\\nwas measured at 30° and 75°. Again reverse hysteresis\\nwas found, but this time the greatest width of the loop\\nwas only 1.5% of the maximum effect. Within the limits\\nof error (not over 0.07%) the compressibility was the\\nsame at the two temperatures. If the mean of the\\nascending and descending branches of the loop is taken,\\nand the compressibility is assumed equal in all directions,\\nthen the relation between pressure and change of volume\\nis given by the formula: |\\n\\n.~ = 15.60 X 107’ p — 13.4 K 107\" pp’.\\n\\nAdams and Williamson? found for two diabases of\\ndensities 3.002 and 2.975, 12.4 *107 and 14.1 x 107\\nrespectively for the average compressibility between\\n2000 and 10000, with no perceptible variation with pres-\\nsure. My basalt, which is diabasic in character, was not\\nas dense; the agreement is as good as to be expected.\\n\\nTalc—Measurements were made on four samples.\\nThe first sample was a rod 10 em. long, not from the\\nidentical piece as the thermal conductivity sample, but\\nfrom the same lot. It was without evident schistosity\\nor other structure. It was measured at 30° and 75°.\\nThe smoothed results at these two temperatures were\\nsensibly the same, although at 75° there were perfectly\\nconsistent small departures from the usual course con-\\nsisting of a somewhat accelerated volume change at low\\npressures followed by a retardation, such that the total\\nvolume change at 12000 was the same as at 30°. There\\nwas no reverse hysteresis in perceptible amount. The rela-\\ntion between volume change and pressure for this\\nsample, assuming equal compressibility in all directions,\\nis given by the formula:\\n\\nAV\\nV\\n\\n— 10.4 X 10 \"p— 6.38 X 107\" p’.\\n\\n0\\n\\nThis compressibility is so much less than I expected\\nfrom the general softness of the substance, that the\\nquestion arose whether it was really equally compressible\\nin all directions. Professor Palache informed me that a\\nstructure would be expected from the manner of. depost-\\n\\nAm. Jour. Scr.—Firts Sreriss, Vou. VII, No. 38.—FrEsruary, 1924.\\n 98 iP. W.

He was so kind\\nas to select for me a sample from the same lot‘as the other\\nsamples which did show schistosity, the material evi-\\ndently having been laid down on a series of planes.\\nFrom this block three short rods were cut in directions\\nmutually at right angles, and the compressibility of each\\nof these rods was measured at 30°.\\n\\nThe results obtained for these three samples were all\\nperfectly regular, and without hysteresis, direct or\\nreverse. The relation between change of length and\\npressure could in each case be represented by an expres-\\nsion of the second degree in the pressure. The following\\nvalues were found:\\n\\nSample # I\\n\\nA\\nae 8.76 X 107\" p — 16.6 & 107\" p?\\n\\nSample # IT\\n\\nA\\nT= 5.69 X 107\" p — 5.49 K 107\" p”\\n\\nSample # ITI\\n\\nA ;\\nAl _ 3.84 x L077 p — 4.93 X-107\"? p?,\\n\\n0\\n\\nSamples I and III were cut parallel to the plane of\\nschistosity, while II was perpendicular to it. The results\\nshow in the first place a variation with direction of 2.3\\nfold, which is greater than I had expected in material of\\nthis character. In the second place, there is no immedi-\\nate connection evident with the plane of schistosity, the\\nlinear compressibility of II being intermediate between\\nthe other two.\\n\\nThe average initial volume compressibility, obtained\\nby adding the three initial linear compressibilities, 1s\\n18.3 x 107. The sample first measured was evidently\\n Compressibility of Rocks under Pressure. 99\\n\\ncut by accident along a direction of very low compressi-\\nbility. © ,\\n\\nIt is evident enough that a distortional wave through\\nmaterial of this character will not be propagated as\\nthrough a homogeneous isotropic substance.\\n\\nThe great variation found in the linear compressibility\\nof pipestone and tale probably has an important bearing\\non a suggestion in the recent paper of L. H. Adams and\\nWilliamson.!® These authors measured the cubic com-\\npressibility of rocks between 2000 and 12000 kg. by a\\ndirect method, but did not carry their results below\\n2000. EF. D. Adams and E. G. Coker,\" on the other hand,\\nhad measured the compressibility at low stresses by an\\nindirect method which involved the assumption of the\\nhomogeneity and isotropy of the material. They found\\ncompressibilities which in some cases were twice as high\\nas those found by L. H. Adams and Williamson. Adams\\nand Williamson reconcile the two sets of results by sup-\\nposing below 2000 kg. a very rapid increase of compressi-\\nbility, which is perhaps connected in some way with a\\nlooseness of structure of the rocks which disappears at\\nhigh pressures. Of course it is possible that this may\\nbe the correct explanation, and in any event the ultimate\\nanswer can only be obtained by a direct measurement of\\nthe comvressibility at low pressures, but in view of my\\nresults above it seems to me that a much more likely\\nexplanation is that the values of F.

Adams and Coker\\nare in error because of failure of the necessary isotropy.\\nDifferences of elastic properties with direction of the\\nmagnitude which I have found above would be more than\\nsufficient to explain the divergent results. ,\\n\\nPyrex Glass.—This material was in the form of a rod\\nabout 15 cm. long and 6 mm. in diameter. It was from\\nthe same length of tubing as the thermal conductivity\\nsample, and was made from it by working in the fire into\\na solid rod and drawing down. It was not perfectly\\nhomogeneous, but there were a few minute bubbles in it.\\n\\nThe compressibility was measured at 30° and 75°.\\nThe results were very regular and self-consistent. The\\nmaximum. departure of any point from a smooth curve\\nwas 0.36% of the maximum effect. There was no\\nhysteresis of any kind. Within the limits of error there\\nwas no difference between the compressibility at the two\\ntemperatures. Assuming equal compressibility in all\\n 100) PP. W. Bridgman—Thermal Conductivity and\\n\\ndirections, the relation between pressure and change of\\nvolume is given by the formula:\\n\\nAV\\nv\\n\\n0\\n\\n= 80.27 & LO p+ 9.9 x 107? p?,\\n\\nThis glass shows the abnormal feature, the first time\\nthat I have found it, of a compressibility which increases\\nat high pressures. The effect is comparatively large,\\nand much beyond the possibility of any experimental\\nerror, As I have already said elsewhere in discussing\\nthe possibility of such an effect,!? there seems to be no\\nfundamental reason why the effect should not -exist, but\\nit certainly is not what we expect. One might be inclined\\nto search for a connection between the effect and the\\nminute bubbles in the glass, but the effect of bubbles\\nwould be expected to be in the opposite direction, giving\\ntoo high a compressibility at low pressures before the\\nbubbles close up, and furthermore if the bubbles are\\nnumerous enough to have a perceptible effect on com-\\npressibility, one would look for hysteresis arising from\\nnon-hydrostatie internal strains in the neighborhood of\\nthe bubbles.*\\n\\nEvidence confirming the reality of this effect may be\\ndrawn from the work of Adams, Williamson,’? and\\nJohnston on compressibility. They found for all their\\nmaterials whose compressibility was as high as this a\\ndecrease of compressibility with rising pressure with the\\nexception of silica glass, which was constant between\\n2000 and 8000 kg.,in spite of the comparatively high\\nvalue of its compressibility, 3.1 x 10*. Now the experi-\\nments of Adams, Williamson and Johnston are not as\\nsensitive as these to changes of compressibility with\\npressure, and it may well be that if they did not find the\\neffect it is really negative. At any rate it is abnormally\\nsmall.\\n\\nThe compressibility of the pyrex found above,\\n3.03 & 10°, is unusually high for a glass which for ordi-\\nnary compositions is in the neighborhood of 2.3. The\\n\\n* Note added on reading proof. The abnormal change of compressibility\\nwith pressure has now been verified on a sample of pyrex glass free from\\nflaws and thoroughly annealed, prepared for me by the Corning Glass Works\\nfor this express purpose.\\n Compressibility of Rocks under Pressure. 83\\n\\naxis is a source of heat. This heat flows out radially\\nthrough the inner copper cylinder, through the shell of\\nrock, through the outer copper cylinder, and into the\\nsurrounding temperature bath through the walls of the\\npressure eylinder into which the outer copper cylinder\\nclosely fits. The difference of temperature between the\\ninner and outer copper cylinders is measured with\\nthermo-couples. From a- knowledge of the heat input,\\nthe temperature difference and the geometrical config-\\nuration, the thermal conductivity may be computed.\\n\\nThe interior of the pressure cylinder, in which the\\nthermal conductivity apparatus is contained, is entirely\\nfilled with an electrically insulating liquid (petroleum\\nether for 30° and kerosene for 75°) in which the conduc-\\ntivity cylinders are completely bathed. Pressure may be\\napplied to this liquid by means of the intensifier which I\\nhave often described.t| The pressure is transmitted by\\nthe liquid equally to all parts of the conductivity appa-\\nratus. The thermal conductivity may now be determined\\nas a function of the pressure in the liquid.\\n\\nThe most important correction to be applied to the\\nreadings directly obtained is that due to the lack\\nof perfect fit between the cylinder of rock and the inner.\\nand outer copper cylinders. It was of course not possi-\\nble to make the fit perfect, so that in addition to the rock\\nin which we are interested there was always a film of\\nliquid between the two copper cylinders. What was\\nactually measured was the resultant conductivity of\\nlayers of rock and liquid in series. Since the thermal\\nconductivity of the liquid is much less than that of the\\nrock, it is necessary to know the geometrical dimensions\\naccurately. The cylinders were formed by machining\\nor grinding, and were of a gratifying geometrical reg-\\nularity. The outside diameter was uniform within a few\\nten-thousandths of an inch, as was also the length. The\\noutside measurements could be made with sufficient\\naccuracy with ordinary micrometers, and mean dimen-\\nsions obtained from a large number of readings. The\\ninside diameter could not be measured directly. This\\nwas obtained from the total weight of the specimen, its\\ndensity (which was determined by weighing in water in\\nthe regular way), and the outside dimensions. The cop-\\nper cylinders could be measured directly with sufficient\\n Compressibility of Rocks under Pressure. 101\\n\\nvalue for pyrex is close to the value of Adams, William-\\nson, and Johnston for silica glass, suggesting a similarity\\nof effect.\\n\\nThis increase of compressibility at high pressures\\ndeserves to be more extensively investigated with other\\nmaterials.\\n\\nSummary.\\n\\nThermal Conductivity—The thermal conductivity of\\npipestone, tale, Solenhofen limestone, basalt, pyrex glass\\nand rock salt has been measured up to 12000 kg/cm? at\\n30° and in most cases at 75° also. The conductivity\\nincreases with rising pressure by an amount which may\\nvary from 0.1% per 1000 kg. at 30° for Solenhofen lime-\\nstone to 3.6% for rock salt. Probably for the ordinary\\nrock of the earth’s crust the effect is not over 0.5% at\\nordinary temperatures. The absolute conductivity and\\nits pressure coefficient may either increase or decrease\\nwith rising temperature.\\n\\nCompressibility—A simple hydrostatic pressure\\napplied to substances of the character of those measured\\nhere does not in general produce a uniform change of\\nvolume, but the effects are complicated. The relation\\nbetween pressure and deformation may be affected by\\nhvsteresis in a direction the reverse of normal; I have\\nfound this in pipestone, Solenhofen- limestone, and\\nbasalt in amounts varying from a few per cent to 18 per\\ncent of the whole deformation. Tale and pipestone show\\nlarge differences of linear compressibility in different\\ndirections; this effect was not investigated for the other\\nmaterials. Pyrex glass has an abnormal increase of\\ncompressibility at high pressures.\\n\\nGeological Consequences.—As far as the results on\\nthermal conductivity go, only rough conclusions can be\\ndrawn, but it would seem that in view of the possible\\nvariations found with pressure and temperature one\\nshould be prepared in geological speculations to con-\\nsider that thermal conductivity at a depth of several\\nhundred miles may be several fold greater than the value\\nnow accepted.\\n\\nThat the compressibility is different in different direc-\\ntions suggests that deep in the earth’s crust where there\\nare large differential stresses, with the probability of\\n 102.

From the dimensions of the solid parts, the\\ndimensions of the liquid layer could be determined. The\\ndimensions of the rock cylinders were approximately\\n0.5000 inches (1.27 em.) outside diameter and 0.4000\\n(1.02 em.) inside diameter and 1 inch (2.5 em.) long.\\n\\nFig. 1.—Cross section of the thermal conductivity measuring apparatus.\\n\\' Horizontal shading represents copper, diagonal shading the rock under\\nmeasurement, and the unshaded part the pressure transmitting liquid.\\n\\nIn fig. 1 is shown a cross section of the thermal con-\\nductivity apparatus, in which the cylinder of rock is\\nshown shaded diagonally between the outer and inner\\neylinders of copper (horizontally shaded) separated\\nfrom them by the unshaded layers of liquid.

There is, however, a geometrical\\ncorrection due to the change with pressure of the length\\nof the axis of the cylinder, but this correction is so small\\nthat it was neglected in the present work.\\n\\nThe formula gives at once the means of calculating the\\nconductivity of the rock if that of the surrounding liquid\\nis known. This was determined as a function of pressure\\nby the experiments on liquids, and the numerical values\\nmay be found in the paper describing those experiments.\\nThe correction for the liquid was of the order of one-\\nthird or one-quarter of the total effect at atmospheric\\npressure. Under the maximum pressure the conductiv-\\nity of the liquid increases by a factor of 2.7, so that the\\ncorrection is correspondingly reduced at the high pres-\\nsures. ‘T\\'he results are, therefore, better at the high than\\nat the low pressures.\\n\\nChoice of Materials ——The chief restriction on the\\nchoice of materials was the necessity of being able to\\nwork them into accurate cylindrical shells.

The other materials\\n\\n_@7i\\n6,—8.= | log\\n 86 =P. W. Bridgman—Thermal Conductivity and\\n\\nI chose after conference with Professor Daly, the object\\nbeing to obtain a few materials which could be worked\\nwith some degree of ease, and which at the same time.\\nin conjunction with the tale and pipestone already\\nselected, should fairly represent the range of material\\nto be encountered in the earth’s crust. It was at his sug-\\ngestion that Solenhofen limestone and a diabasic basalt\\nwere selected. Both of these were too hard to machine,\\nand had to be worked to shape by grinding. I am\\nindebted to Mr. David Mann for devising a method of\\ndoing this, and to my mechanic Mr. T. R. Richardson for\\nskillfully preparing the specimens. In addition to these,\\npyrex glass was also measured at the suggestion of Pro-\\nfessor Daly, who recognized the importance of an\\nexample of a glassy non-crystalline material. This was\\nnot prepared by grinding, but was cut into the proper\\nlength from a piece of commercial tubing of such size as\\nto fit closely the copper cylinders both inside and outside.\\nThis specimen was selected personally by Professor Daly\\nafter detailed examination of an extensive commercial\\nstock. HEven with this care, the glass was not as perfect\\ngeometrically as the ground specimens, but showed\\neccentricities of 1.5%. Mean dimensions of the glass\\nwere used in the ealenlations.\\n\\nIn addition to the rocks I have measured the thermal\\neonduetivity of rock salt under pressure, chiefly for its\\nphysical interest, as we are now becoming able to explain\\na good many of the physical properties of simple\\nerystals, and of rock salt in particular, in terms of the\\nfine structure, and the thermal conductivity of no simple\\nerystal has been measured under pressure.\\n\\nAnalysis of the Materials.—The pipestone was obtained\\nfrom the Ward Natural History Establishment at\\nRochester, N. Y., and is the material described by Dana\\nas ‘‘eatlinite.’’ It is an iron-rich clay stone; a typical\\nanalysis gives: SiO, 57.4, Al.O, 25.9, Fe.O, 8.7, H.O 7.4,\\nMgO and CaO trace. It is without ovitty inclusions of\\nany kind, and may be turned in the lathe without damage\\nto the keen edge of a steel tool. The material was not per-\\nfectly homogeneous in appearance, but the color varied\\nfrom a deep red to a much paler and yellowish hue. The\\nthermal conductivity sample was a deep red throughout.\\nIts density at 20° was 2.840 (corrected for vacunm, as\\nare all the densities given in the following).\\n land\\n\\nCompressibility of Rocks under Pressure. 8\\n\\nThe tale was from the Hewitt mine, Hewitt, N. C. and\\nwas very soft without any gritty inclusions. The analy-\\nsis is given as follows in Heconomic Paper No. 3, 1900, of\\nthe N. C. Geological Survey: Water 5.10; Silica (Si0,)\\n61.35; Al,O, 4.42; FeO 1.68; CaO 0.82; MgO 26.03;\\nNa,.O 0.62; and K,O trace.\\n\\nThe material is not perfectly homogeneous, but there\\nis a certain amount of schistosity evident, the material\\nhaving apparently been laid down im layers. The den-\\nsity at 20° 1s 2.701. ,\\n\\nThe Solenhofen limestone is very nearly pure CaCO...\\nIt is of a light brownish color, and was deposited in\\nlayers from one-half to three-quarters of an inch thick.\\nThe thermal conductivity and the compressibility samples\\nwere cut from the same layer. The density at 20° is\\n2.602.\\n\\nThe diabasic basalt is described as follows by Profes-\\nsor K. S. Larsen of the University Museum; I am much\\nindebted to him for procuring the analysis.\\n\\n‘“‘The sample is made up in large part of labradorite laths\\nand augite grains, the latter moulding about and between the\\nformer. There is about 10% of interstitial brown matrix that\\nwas originally mostly glass but is now partly devitrified and car-\\nries microlites of augite and is clouded with magnetite grains.\\nOlivine in grains now altered to a serpentine-like mineral makes\\nup nearly 10% of the rock. The feldspars are partly altered\\nto a mineral that resembles sericite.\\n\\nThe plagioclase laths average about 0.1 mm. in length, the\\nolivine grains about 0.1 mm. in diameter and the augite grains\\na little larger. The serpentine and sericite are hydrous minerals\\nand might lose some of their water even below 100° C.’’\\n\\nThe density at room temperature was 2.924.\\n\\nThe pyrex glass was approximately: S10, 81.35, B.O,\\n11.50, Na,O 4.00; Al,O, 2.1, CaO 0.2, MgO 0.28. The\\ndensity at room temperature was 2.234.\\n\\nThe rock salt was a natural crystal, perfectly clear and\\nflawless. It was machined to shape in the lathe with\\ncutting tools, and I owe it to the skill of Mr. David Mann.\\n\\nResults—The regularity of the readings was not as\\ngreat as that possible to obtain with the liquids. The\\nreason is that the apparatus is best adapted to materials\\nwith low conductivity, and the conductivity of liquids is\\nlower than that of those solids measured here. Never-\\ntheless a degree of accuracy was obtained amply sufficient\\nfor the purpose in hand, and doubtless the accuracy of\\n 88 P. W.

 dwivedi  et  al.,  2008).  however,  such  alterations  are\\nalso  affected  by  the  conﬁnement  applying  on  the  rock  mass,  and\\nconﬁning  pressure  causes  the  suppression  of  thermal  cracks  and\\nthe  extension/widening  of  existing  micro-cracks.  this  results  in\\nfurther  alteration  of  the  rock  mass  mechanical  properties,  resulting  in  changing  failure  modes  (mogi,  1966).  studies  have  identiﬁed\\nthe  transition  of  rock  failure  mode  from  brittle  to  ductile  with\\nincreasing  conﬁnement.  however,  this  transition  is  diverse  due  to\\nthe  different  mineralogical  compositions  and  grain  boundaries  in\\ndifferent  rocks  (klein  et  al.,  2001;  wong,  1982).\\n\\nalthough  many  studies  have  been  conducted  to  investigate  the\\ntemperature-dependent  mechanical  behaviour  of  reservoir  rocks,\\nmost  experiments  have  been  conducted  in  unconﬁned  environments  (singh  et  al.,  2015;  shao  et  al.,  2014).  pre-heating  the\\nspecimens  to  the  corresponding  temperature  ranges  and  testing  at  room  temperatures  has  been  frequently  done  (bauer  and\\njohnson,  1979;  xu  et  al.,  2008),  but  the  method  is  not  reliable,\\nas  geothermal  reservoirs  experience  continuous  thermal  stresses.\\nsuch  limitations  have  occurred  mainly  due  to  the  limited  number  of\\nappropriate  test  facilities  available  to  simulate  the  stress  and  temperature  conditions  of  actual  geothermal  reservoirs.  although  some\\nstudies  have  analytically  and  numerically  evaluated  the  mechanical\\nproperties  of  rocks  under  high  temperatures  and  pressures  (chester\\nand  higgs,  1992;  tian  et  al.,  2013;  vásárhelyi  et  al.,  2016),  to  date\\nnone  has  captured  the  stress-strain  behaviour  and  failure  criteria  of\\nrocks  over  a  wide  range  of  conﬁning  pressures  and  temperatures,\\nparticularly  for  australian  granite.  however,  the  thermo-elastic\\nresponse  and  appropriate  failure  criteria  are  essential  inputs  for\\nmany  engineering  applications  under  high  pressures  and  temperatures,  including  geothermal  extraction  applications.  this  study\\ntherefore  intends  to  ﬁll  this  gap,  and  it  is  hoped  it  will  make  an\\nimportant  contribution  to  many  deep  underground  applications.\\n\\n2.  methodology\\n\\n2.1.  tested  material\\n\\ngranite  is  an  abundant  crystalline  rock  in  the  earth  with  medium\\nto  coarse  grains  which  was  formed  as  a  result  of  the  slow  cooling\\nof  magma.  granite  therefore  has  abundant  radioactive  elements\\n(k,  th,  and  u).  such  elements  bring  elevated  geothermal  gradients\\nto  deep  granite  reservoirs,  which  therefore  have  ideal  conditions\\nas  geothermal  reservoirs.  the  mineralogical  composition  of  granite  mainly  consists  of  quartz,  feldspar,  plagioclase  and  biotite,  and\\nsmall  amounts  of  muscovite,  amphibole,  hornblende  and  opaque\\n(dwivedi  et  al.,  2008).\\n\\nfor  the  present  study,  samples  were  collected  from  the  strathbogie  batholith,  which  is  a  composite  granitoid  intrusion  body\\nspreading  over  more  than  1500  km2 in  150  km  north-east  from\\nmelbourne  (fig.  1).  strathbogie  granite  is  a  high-level,  discordant\\n\\nfig.  1.  sampling  location  of  strathbogie  batholith  in  central  victoria.\\n\\ntable  1\\nphysical,  mechanical  and  petrographic  properties  of  strathbogie  granite  (obtained\\nunder  room  temperature  and  atmospheric  pressure  conditions).\\n\\nrock  type \\n\\ngranite\\n\\ncolour \\naverage  grain  size \\npetrographic  description \\n\\nbulk  density  (kg/m3)\\ncompressive  strength  (mpa) \\nelastic  modulus  (gpa) \\nporosity  (%) \\n\\n\\u242em\\n\\nwhite  with  dark  brown\\n70–600 \\nmainly  consists  of  feldspar,  biotite,\\nquartz  and  plagioclase  equigranular,\\ncoarse  grained,  s-type  granite\\n2703.4\\n118.17\\n9.09\\n1.16\\n\\ntable  2\\nresults  of  xrd  analysis.\\n\\nmineral  id \\n\\nalpha  quartz\\nsodic  and  intermediate  plagioclase \\nbiotite—phlogopite \\nk-feldspar \\nclinochlore \\nmuscovite—sericite\\ndolomite—ankerite \\nother  minerals \\n\\nmass%\\n\\n50\\n16\\n15\\n13\\n2\\n2\\n1\\n1\\n\\ngranite  that  mainly  consists  of  quartz,  k-feldspar,  cordierite  and\\nbiotite  (phillips  et  al.,  1981).  the  selected  granite  type  is  coarsegrained  and  white  and  dark  brown  in  colour  with  around  1.16%\\nporosity.  fig.  2  presents  a  close-up  view  of  a  typical  strathbogie\\ngranite  sample,  an  optical  microscopic  image  and  an  sem  image\\nof  its  thin  section.  as  can  be  seen  in  fig.  2(b),  clear  mineralogical\\nassembling  can  be  observed  in  the  granite  specimen,  mainly  with\\nquartz,  k-feldspar  and  plagioclase.  as  shown  in  fig.  3,  the  grain  size\\nwas  measured  from  a  thin  section  of  this  granite  and  found  to  be\\n\\u242em  with  only  a  small  number\\nmainly  in  the  range  of  0  mm–200 \\nof  larger  grains  (>300  mm)   (shao  et  al.,  2014).  table  1  summarizes\\nthe  physical,  mechanical  and  petrographic  properties  of  the  tested\\nstrathbogie  granite.  in  addition,  an  xrd  analysis  was  conducted  to\\ndetermine  the  mineralogical  composition  of  the  selected  granite\\nand  the  result  is  shown  in  table  2.  as  the  table  shows,  quartz  is\\nthe  predominant  mineral  in  the  selected  granite  (50%),  followed  by\\n16%  of  sodic  and  intermediate  biotite  and  15%  of  plagioclase.  the\\nmineralogical  composition  of  this  particular  granitic  composition\\nis  representative  of  the  composition  of  the  majority  of  the  earth’s\\ngranites  (best,  1995).  all  the  physical  properties  in  tables  1  and  2\\n\\n\\x0c46 \\n\\nw.g.p.  kumari  et  al.  /  geothermics  65  (2017)  44–59\\n\\nfig.  2.

deep\\nearth  energy  research  laboratory  (deerl)  in  the  civil  engineering  department  of  monash  university,  and  the  sample  preparation\\nwas  conducted  in  accordance  with  the  astm  standard  for  tri-axial\\ncompressive  testing  (astm  d7012-10  (2010)).  in  order  to  maintain\\nconsistency,  all  the  samples  were  cored  to  22.5  mm  in  diameter\\nusing  the  same  block  of  granite  at  the  same  orientation.  during  the\\nsampling  great  care  was  taken  to  obtain  samples  with  the  same\\ncrystalline  orientation,  and  samples  with  different  crystalline  orientation,  internal  layers  and  visible  cracks  were  discarded.  it  should\\nbe  noted  that  coring-induced  rock-microstructure  alteration  is  an\\nimportant  aspect  to  consider  in  laboratory  experiments,  although\\nfew  studies  have  considered  this  effect.  to  avoid  such  issues,  a  very\\nsmall  coring  rate  was  adopted  and  water  was  used  as  a  lubricant.\\nthe  cored  specimens  were  then  cut  into  45  mm  high  cylinders  and\\nboth  ends  of  the  specimens  were  ground  to  produce  two  parallel\\nsurfaces  perpendicular  to  the  axes  of  the  cylindrical  specimens.\\n\\n2.3.  experimental  procedure\\n\\ntri-axial  experiments  were  conducted  on  samples  under  four\\ndifferent  conﬁning  pressures  (10,  30,  60  and  90  mpa)  and  four\\ndifferent  temperatures  (rt,  100,  200,  300 ◦c).  these  experimental  conditions  were  selected,  because  the  most  preferable  hot  dry\\nrock  systems  are  generally  located  at  depths  of  2.5–3.5  km  and\\nhave  around  70  mpa–120  mpa   conﬁning  pressures  (assuming  the\\nreservoir  rock  density  is  equal  to  2500  kg/m3)  and  temperatures  of\\n\\n200–350 ◦c  (breede  et  al.,  2013).  the  different  conﬁning  pressures\\nand  temperatures  were  selected  to  simulate  the  reservoir  depth\\neffect  and  to  obtain  a  sufﬁcient  data  set  to  understand  the  failure\\ncriteria  under  different  temperatures.\\n\\nthe  complete  arrangement  of  the  tri-axial  cell  is  shown  in\\nfig.  3.  the  prepared  sample  was  ﬁrst  placed  inside  the  cell  and  the\\nrequired  conﬁning  pressure  was   then  applied  using  a  silicon  oil  system,  and  an  annealed  copper  sleeve  was  used  to  isolate  the  sample\\nfrom  the  conﬁning  liquid  (refer  to  fig.  3(b).  a  mica-insulated  metal\\nband  heater  was   used  to  heat  the  pressure  cell  and  consequently\\nthe  rock  sample.  the  temperatures  of  the  cell  were  adjusted  using  a\\ncontroller  and  a  constant  small  heating  rate  of  2.5 ◦c/min  was  used\\nto  prevent  micro-structural  damage  due  to  sudden  thermal  shocks.\\ntwo  separate  thermocouples  were  used  to  achieve  precise  temperature  control,  and  the  reading  of  the  thermocouple  installed  inside\\nthe  cell  (fig.  3(b))  was   recorded  by  the  data  acquisition  system.  the\\nother  thermocouple  that  was   attached  to  the  barrel  (fig.  3(a))  was\\nused  to  control  the  band  heater.  furthermore,  the  barrel  and  the\\ntop  of  the  pressure  cell  were  covered  using  an  insulating  blanket\\nto  reduce  heat  loss  during  the  experiments  and  to  minimise  the\\ninﬂuence  of  air  ﬂows  towards  the  cell.  all  the  tests  were  started\\nonce  the  system  had  achieved  a  steady  state  to  ensure  uniformity\\nin  temperature  and  pressure  across  the  sample.  equilibrium  was\\nensured  by  monitoring  the  conﬁnement  pump  volume  and  the\\nthermocouple  readings  inside  the  cell  (located  very  close  to  the\\nspecimen).  under  steady-state  conditions,  constant  pump  volume\\nand  constant  temperature  were  observed  and  testing  was   initiated.\\na\\n  constant  loading  pump  ﬂow  rate  of  1  ml/min  was  adopted  for\\nall  the  test  specimens  and  the  converted  displacement  rate  was\\n0.05  mm/min.  it  should  be  noted  that  a  small  shaft  resistance  exists\\nas  a  result  of  the  sealing  of  the  hydraulic  cylinder,  and  this  effect\\nwas  considered  in  the  calibration  of  the  loading  cell.  the  sealing\\nresistance  was  obtained  by  measuring  the  pump  pressure  to  initiate  a  movement  in  the  loading  shaft,  and  this  was   deducted  from\\neach  pressure  reading  to  eliminate  the  resistance  of  the  sealing  dur\\x0cw.g.p.  kumari  et  al.  /  geothermics  65  (2017)  44–59

from  initial  loading  to  the  peak  value,\\nbeyond  which  strain  softening  occurred,  causing  a  rapid  stress  drop\\nto  a  residual  value.  increasing  peak  stress  with  increasing  conﬁning  pressure  can  be  observed,  which  is  to  be  expected,  according\\nto  typical  mohr-coulomb  type  brittle  failure  (paterson  and  wong,\\n2005).\\n\\ntraditionally,  rock  failure  in  compression  can  occur  in  two\\nmain  ways;  (a)  dilatancy  and  failure  by  strain  softening  under\\nrelatively  low  conﬁning  pressures  and  (b)  failure  by  strain  hardening  under  elevated  conﬁning  pressures,  and  a  transitional  regime\\nmay   be  observed  at  intermediate  pressures.  these  transitional  failure  modes  have  been  referred  to  as  “quasi-brittle”,  and  complex\\nlocalized  features  such  as  conjugate  shear  bands  can  be  observed\\nunder  such  conditions  (klein  et  al.,  2001;  gajo  et  al.,  2004).  by\\nvisual  inspection  of  the  post-failure  samples,  important  information  about  the  alteration  of  the  granite  failure  mechanism  with\\nconﬁning  pressures  and  temperatures  can  be  identiﬁed.  postfailure  images  (fig.  5)  were  therefore  collected  after  each  test.\\n\\naccording  to  the  post-failure  images,  specimens  that  failed\\nat  10–60  mpa   conﬁning  pressures  mainly  failed  by  shear  localization  along  an  inclined  macroscopic  shear  band  with  a  single\\nshear  zone  across  each  sample.  however,  samples  tested  at  higher\\nconﬁnements  of  90  mpa   and  120  mpa   (at  100 ◦c)  exhibited  strain\\nhardening  characteristics  after  achieving  the  peak  stress,  and  several  conjugate  shear  bands  could  be  observed  on  the  cylindrical\\nsample  surface,  instead  of  the  single  shear  band  observed  earlier.\\nthis  characteristic  was  signiﬁcant  at  120  mpa   conﬁning  pressure.\\nhowever,  it  should  be  noted  that  only  one  test  was   conducted\\nat  120  mpa   conﬁnement,  because  at  such  high  conﬁning  pressures  the  corresponding  failure  load  of  granite  exceeds  the  bottom\\npedestal’s  load-bearing  capacity.  further,  a  progressive  reduction\\nwas  observed  in  the  failure  plane  angle  with  respect  to  the  minor\\nprincipal  stress  direction  with  increasing  conﬁning  pressure,  which\\nimplies  a  reduction  in  friction  angle,  possibly  due  to  the  greater\\nquasi-brittle  behaviour  that  was   shown  by  granite  samples  at\\nhigher  conﬁning  pressures  (wong  et  al.,  2001).\\n\\n3.2.  effect  of  temperature  and  conﬁning  pressure  on  mechanical\\nproperties  of  strathbogie  granite\\n\\nfig.  6  illustrates  the  inﬂuence  of  temperature  on  the  deviatoric\\nstress  of  the  tested  granite  under  each  conﬁnement.  as  the  ﬁgure  shows,  the  inﬂuence  of  conﬁnement  is  more  signiﬁcant  than\\nthat  of  temperature  in  the  temperature  range  considered  here.\\nwong  and  brace  (1979)  conﬁrm  that  at  lower  conﬁning  pressures\\nconsiderable  thermal  cracking  occurs  at  relatively  low  temperatures.  if  thermal  cracking  is  responsible  for  the  reduction  in  failure\\nstrength,  a  sharp  reduction  in  deviatoric  stress  with  increasing\\ntemperature  (with  suppression  of  thermal  cracks)  should  be  exhibited  under  unconﬁned  pressure  condition.  however,  based  on  the\\nexperimental  results,  under  unconﬁned  conditions,  up  to  100 ◦c,\\n17.6%  of  increment  in  deviatoric  stress  is  followed  by  2.5%  and\\n10.5%  reductions  at  200 ◦c  and  300 ◦c,  respectively.  however,  when\\nconﬁnement  was  applied,  strength  reduction  was  initiated  after\\n  higher  temperature  of  200 ◦c,  mainly  due  to  the  inhibition  of\\na\\nthermal  cracks  by  induced  compressive  force.  thermal  cracking  is\\ntherefore  an  important  strength  property  alteration  mechanism  in\\nreservoir  rocks  under  certain  conﬁning  pressure  conditions.\\n\\na\\n\\n  clear  inﬂuence  of  temperature  on  deviatoric  stress  at  any\\ndepth  or  conﬁnement  can  be  observed,  and  increasing  the  temperature  from  room  temperature  to  200 ◦c  causes  an  increment  in\\ndeviatoric  stress,  and  further  increasing  of  temperature  to  300 ◦c\\ncauses  a  slight  reduction  in  it.  this  is  because  the  thermal  expansion\\nwhich  occurs  with  increasing  temperature  causes  the  reduction  of\\n\\nfig.  3.

researchers\\ntherefore  did  not  pay  close  attention  to  reservoir  rock  behaviour\\nunder  relatively  low  geothermal  temperature  ranges  (<300 ◦c).  this\\nwas  the  focus  of  the  present  study,  according  to  which  there  is\\nan  initial  strengthening  and  stiffening  in  granite  with  increasing\\ntemperature  at  low  temperatures  (up  to  200 ◦c),  and  increasing\\nthe  temperature  beyond  a  certain  value  causes  a  gradual  reduction  in  failure  stress  with  increasing  temperature.  elastic  modulus\\nis  an  important  mechanical  property  of  any  reservoir  rock,  and\\n\\ndescribes  the  brittle  characteristics  of  the  rock  mass.  it  is  therefore\\noften  used  to  evaluate  many  in-situ  stress  applications,  including\\nwellbore  stability,  fracturing  possibility  and  tectonic  stress  distribution  (heard  and  page,  1982).  the  temperature-dependent  brittle\\nproperties  (elastic  modulus)  of  the  tested  granite  were  then  evaluated.  the  elastic  region  of  each  stress-strain  curve  was  used  to\\ncalculate  the  temperature and  pressure-dependent  young’s  moduli  (e)  and  the  results  are  shown  in  fig.  7.  the  axial  strain  was\\nmeasured  using  lvdts  attached  to  the  loading  ram  with  a  linearity\\n±0.1%  f.s  (full  scale)  (±0.0075  mm)   and  inﬁnite  resoluerror  of \\ntion  (no  hysteresis).  an  increment  of  the  modulus  of  strathbogie\\ngranite  with  increasing  temperature  up  to  200 ◦c  can  be  observed,\\nand  further  increase  of  temperature  (to  300 ◦c)  causes  the  elastic\\nmodulus  to  be  slightly  reduced  for  any  conﬁnement.  this  trend  is\\n\\n\\x0ca\\n\\n‘brittle’  or \\n\\n  general  increment  in  elastic  modulus  with  increasing  conﬁnement  can  be  observed  until  90  mpa,  and  a  further  increase\\nof  conﬁnement  (to  120  mpa)  reduces  the  young’s  modulus  considerably.  with \\nincreasing  conﬁning  stress  additional  plastic\\ndeformation  occurs,  exhibiting  strain-hardening  characteristics  in\\ngranite  under  high  conﬁnements.  however,  within  the  range  of\\nthe  experiments  conducted  (10  mpa–120  mpa)  it  cannot  be  deﬁnitively  identiﬁed  as  a \\n’ductile’  regime.  however,  the\\nstrain-hardening  behaviour  observed  at  120  mpa   indicates  transitional  characteristics  and  this  can  be  identiﬁed  as  ‘quasi-brittle’\\nbehaviour  (klein  et  al.,  2001).  the  initial  young’s  modulus  reduction  with  increasing  conﬁnement  was  observed  by  heard  and  page\\n(1982),  who   conducted  tests  up  to  55  mpa   conﬁning  pressure.  however,  the  latter  behaviour  was  not  observed  by  these  researchers.\\ninterestingly,  according  to  the  research  literature,  at  low  temperatures  (<200 ◦c)  some  granite  types  are  more  temperature-sensitive,\\nwhile  in  contrast,  some  granites  are  more  temperature-sensitive\\nat  high  temperatures.  the  initial  strength  enhancement  is  more\\nsigniﬁcant  for  coarse-grained  granites  and  granodiorite  than  for\\nﬁne-grained  granites.  for  example,  according  to  heard  and  page\\n(1982),  stripa  granite  is  more  sensitive  to  temperature  at  relatively  low  temperatures  (<200 ◦c),  and  westerly  granite  is  more\\nsensitive  to  temperature  at  high  temperatures  (>200 ◦c).  such  contradictory  behaviours  may   occur  in  granite  due  to  the  different\\ngrain  size  distributions,  grain  orientations,  mineralogical  compositions  and  heterogeneity  of  different  granite  types.  this  indicates  the\\nimportance  of  studying  the  mineralogical  composition  and  microstructural  inﬂuence  of  granites  on  such  on  temperature-dependent\\nstrength  variations.\\n\\n3.3.  effect  of  temperature  on  shear  strength  parameters  of\\nstrathbogie  granite\\n\\nfig.  8  illustrates  the  variation  of  deviatoric  stress  of  the  tested\\ngranite  with  conﬁning  pressure  for  each  temperature.  the  ﬁgure\\nshows  that  increasing  conﬁnement  causes  the  granite’s  deviatoric\\nstress  to  increase  non-linearly  and  gradually  come  to  a  steady  state.\\nthis  is  consistent  with  similar  previous  studies,  which  have  clearly\\nshown  the  enhancement  of  rock  strength  with  increasing  conﬁnement,  and  the  increasing  rate  is  reduced  with  increasing  conﬁning\\npressure  (barton,  2013;  singh  et  al.,  2011).  this  is  because  at  low\\nconﬁning  pressures  there  is  a  high  dilation  potential.  therefore,  the\\nability  to  open  rock  micro-cracks  is  high,  resulting  in  higher  friction  angles.  however,  this  dilation  potential  and  the  corresponding\\ntendency  for  micro-cracks  to  open  are  suppressed  with  increasing\\nconﬁnement,  resulting  in  lower  friction  angles  at  higher  conﬁning  pressures.  therefore,  the  failure  mechanism  of  the  rocks  shifts\\nfrom  brittle  to  ductile  with  increasing  conﬁnement,  changing  the\\nshape  of  the  mohr-coulomb  failure  envelope,  and  according  to\\nbarton  (1976),  at  critical  conﬁning  pressure  the  mohr-coulomb  failure  envelope  reaches  a  zero  gradient.  this  has  also  been  shown\\nby  hoek  (1983).  the  present  study  has  clearly  identiﬁed  this  rock\\nbehaviour  in  the  mohr-coulomb  failure  envelopes  developed  for\\neach  temperature  condition  (refer  to  fig.  9).  according  to  fig.  9,\\nthe  traditional  linear  mohr-coulomb  criteria  are  applicable  only  in\\nthe  brittle  region  of  the  failure  envelope,  and  at  higher  conﬁnew.g.p.  kumari  et  al.  /  geothermics  65  (2017)  44–59\\n\\nconsistent  with  the  temperature-dependent  strength  behaviour  of\\nthe  granite  described  above.  the  reason  for  the  initial  elastic  module  increment  may  be  that  the  specimen  becomes  more  brittle  at\\nthe  initial  temperature  ranges  due  to  thermally-induced  volumetric  expansion  and  the  associated  pore  volume  reduction.  the  later\\nslight  reduction  of  young’s  modulus  with  increasing  temperature\\nexhibits  an  enhancement  in  ductile  behaviour  (quasi-brittle  characteristics)  with  further  increase  of  temperature.  this  is  possibly\\ndue  to  the  increased  crack  density  caused  by  the  induced  thermal\\ncrack  development  and  the  related  weakening  of  the  granite.\\n\\n600\\n\\n500\\n\\n400\\n\\n300\\n\\n200\\n\\n100\\n\\n0\\n\\n50

increasing  the  temperature  to  an  extreme\\nvalue  may   cause  weakening  of  the  grain  boundaries,  dependent  on\\nthe  anisotropy  of  the  rock  matrix  (due  to  potentially  existing  distinct  mineral  compounds  in  granite  those  may   contain  different\\nthermo-elastic  moduli  and  this  may   causes  to  generate  different  internal  stresses  with  heating).  according  to  wong  and  brace\\n(1979),  increasing  the  temperature  causes  the  induction  of  thermal\\ncracks  in  the  rock  mass  due  to  the  associated  generation  of  internal\\nstresses  (eq.  (2)):\\n\\n(2)\\n\\ne(cid:4)˛(cid:4)t \\n\\n= \\n\\n\\u2434\\n\\n \\n\\nwhere,  e,  \\x01␣,   \\x01t   is  the  matrix  young’s  modulus,  difference  of\\nthermal  expansion  coefﬁcient  of  distinct  mineral  and  temperature\\ndifference,  respectively.  when  the  internal  stress  (given  by  eq.

(1997),  the  development  of  local  stress  concentrations  leads\\nto  the  initiation  of  many  intra-granular  micro-cracks  in  the  rock\\nmass,  and  the  crack  density  increases  with  increasing  deviatoric\\nstress  and  tends  to  merge  on  reaching  the  peak  stress,  resulting  in\\nstrain  softening  and  shear  localization.  these  damage  processes  are\\nclearly  identiﬁed  by  the  intense  ae  activities  in  the  ﬁeld  (chang  and\\nlee,  2004).  ae  technology  was  therefore  used  to  investigate  the  progressive  fracturing  behaviour  in  strathbogie

higher  conﬁning  pressures.  however,  the  crack  damage  stress  increases  with  increasing\\nconﬁnement  due  to  the  inﬂuence  of  conﬁning  pressure  on  thermal\\ncrack  development  and  the  suppression  of  the  extension/widening\\nof  existing  micro-cracks.  according  to  fig.  12,  in  the  temperature  range  considered  here,  three  tendencies  can  be  identiﬁed\\nwith  increasing  conﬁning  pressure:  increase  of  the  elastic  deformation  region,  decrease  of  the  stable  crack  propagation  region,  and\\nincrease  of  the  unstable  crack  propagation  region.  the  crack  initiation  stress  threshold  also  progressively  increases  with  increasing\\nconﬁning  pressure,  which  can  be  attributed  to  the  fact  that  the\\nbrittle  behaviour  of  rock  specimens  at  lower  conﬁning  pressures\\nchanges  to  quasi-brittle  behaviour  with  increasing  conﬁning  pressure.  this  is  because  the  suppression  of  micro-crack  development\\nis  less  at  low  conﬁning  pressures,  and  therefore  sudden  failures  mostly  occur,  and  the  beginning  of  crack  initiation  occurs\\n\\nat  earlier  stages  of  deviatoric  loading  at  high  conﬁning  pressures\\ndue  to  the  higher  normal  stress  acting  on  micro-cracks,  resulting  in  limited  progression  of  cracking  before  failure.  in  relation\\nto  the  temperature  effect,  increasing  the  temperature  causes  an\\ninitial  increment  in  the  crack  propagation  stress  threshold,  followed  by  a  slight  reduction  for  all  the  temperature  conditions\\nconsidered.  for  example,  at  30  mpa   conﬁnement,  the  crack  damage  stress  threshold  ratios  increased  by  around  6.8%,  10.5%  with\\nincreasing  temperature  from  room  temperature  to  100  and  200 ◦c,\\nrespectively,  and  reduced  by  around  4.0%  when  the  temperature\\nincreased  to  300 ◦c.  this  implies  that  at  low  temperatures  a  suppressed  micro-crack  development  mechanism  is  dominant,  and\\nincreasing  the  temperature  causes  crack  damage  to  occur  at  earlier  loading  stages.  interestingly,  at  60  mpa   conﬁnement  the  crack\\ndamage  stress  threshold  ratio  increased  by  around  4.9%,  5.4%,\\n2.6%  with  increasing  temperature  from  room  to  100,  200  and\\n300 ◦c,  respectively.  this  exhibits  the  cumulative  effect  of  temperature  and  pressure  micro-crack  development  in  the  rock  mass.\\nat  relatively  low  temperatures,  micro-crack  propagation  may  be\\ninhibited  by  the  thermally-induced  plasticity  mechanism  which\\noccurs  at  crack  tips  and  the  increased  bonding  strength  through\\nthermally-induced  rock  matrix  expansion  (which  increases  crack\\nstress  thresholds).  however,  further  increase  of  temperature  creates  thermally-induced  cracks  and  causes  the  grain  boundary\\ncracks  to  widen,  resulting  in  early  crack  damage.  further,  with  the\\ninﬂuence  of  conﬁnement,  micro-crack  development  is  suppressed,\\ncausing  a  relatively  low  increment  of  crack  damage  stress  threshold\\nratios  at  higher  conﬁnements.\\n\\n3.5.  corresponding  alterations  in  granite  micro-structure\\n\\na\\n\\n  comprehensive  micro-structural  analysis  was   also  performed\\nto  identify  the  interior

seem  to  play  a  signiﬁcant  role  at  relatively  low  temperatures,  probably  due  to  the\\npresence  of  relatively  high  k  feldspar  and  biotite  contents.  similar  observations  have  been  reported  in  bauer  and  johnson’s  (1979)\\nstudy  conducted  for  charcoal  granite,  where  intra-granular  microcracks  predominantly  occur  compared  to  grain  boundary  cracks.\\nthe

 propagation  process  in  any  rock  mass  is  largely\\ninﬂuenced  by  the  mineralogical  composition,  because  cracks  normally  propagate  through  weaker  planes  of  the  rock  mass.  since\\ngranite  is  an  igneous  type  of  rock,  two  main  types  of  thermallyinduced  cracking  modes  can  be  identiﬁed:  inter-granular  and  intragranular.  the  amount  of  inter-granular  or  intra-granular  cracking\\nis  dependent  on  the  stress  state,  rock  type  and  mineralogy  of\\nthe  rock  mass.  inter-granular  cracks  occur  along  grain  boundaries,\\npre-existing  faults  and  micro-cracks  of  the  rock,  while  intragranular  cracks  occur  through  weaker  mineralogical  constituents\\n(kranz,  1983).  for  example,  k feldspar  and  biotite  are  weaker\\n\\nmineralogical  constituents  due  to  their  large  crystals  (>10  mm),\\nas  crystals  greater  than  2–3  mm  in  size  are  generally  deﬁned  as\\nweaker  mineralogical  constituents  compared  to  equi-dimensional\\nsmall  crystals  like  quartz  (homand-etienne  and  houpert,  1989).\\nbased  on  experimental  results,  intra-granular  cracking  is  highly\\ntemperature-dependent  due  to  the  temperature dependent  dislocations  in  the  rocks.  this  is  because  different  mineralogical\\ncomponents  have  different  thermo-elastic  moduli  and  thermal\\nconductivities  (kranz,  1983;  dwivedi  et  al.,  2008).\\n\\nthese  observations  suggest  that  micro-cracking  in  granite  is\\nhighly  temperature dependent,  as  evidenced  by  the  previously\\nobserved  initial  strength  gain  followed  by  slight  strength  reduction  with  increasing  temperature  in  the  tested  granite.  however,\\nthis  shows  that  granite  needs  to  be  heated  to  a  sufﬁcient  temperature  to  cause  thermal  cracks  in  it  and  therefore,  heating  to  a  lower\\ntemperature  may   only  cause  a  strength  gain  through  the  thermal\\nexpansion  of  the  rock  matrix.  this  is  consistent  with  the  results\\nof  bauer  and  johnson  (1979).  the  mechanical  properties  of  charcoal  granite  in  their  study  remained  relatively  steady  until  200 ◦c,\\nand  westerly  granite  exhibited  a  signiﬁcant  thermal  dependency,\\neven  at  relatively  low  temperatures  (<200 ◦c).  in  homand-etienne\\nand  houpert  (1989)  study,  the  variation

four  different  conﬁning  pressures  (10,  30,\\n60,  90  mpa)  and  four  different  temperatures  (rt,  100,  200,  300 ◦c),\\nsimulating  various  geothermal  reservoir  conditions.  the  following\\nconclusions  can  be  drawn:\\n• mechanical  behaviour  of  the  tested  granite  is  inﬂuenced  by  both\\nreservoir  depth  and  temperature,  and  the  depth  effect  is  much\\ngreater  than  the  temperature  effect.\\n• granite \\nlocated  at  relatively  smaller  depths  appears  to  fail\\nthrough  shear  localization  and  increasing  depth  may  cause  this\\nto  change  to  ductile  failure  through  strain  hardening.  a  progressive  enhancement  in  stress  threshold  with  increasing  conﬁning\\npressure  is  observed  in  strathbogie  granite.  such  behaviours\\nexhibit  greater  strength  and  lower  brittle  characteristics  in  granite  located  at  greater  depths.\\n• increasing  of  temperature  causes  granite’s  strength  to  be\\nenhanced  up  to  a  certain  temperature  (around  200 ◦c  for  strathbogie  granite)  through  the  possible  thermal  expansion  of  the\\nrock  matrix  and  further  increasing  of  temperature  may   cause  it\\nto  weaken  by  inducing  thermal  cracks.  this  was  conﬁrmed  by\\nthe  micro-structural  analysis,  which  did  not  reveal  any  noticeable  amount  of  thermally-induced  micro-cracking  in  strathbogie\\ngranite  up  to  200 ◦c,  and  heating  of  the  granite  to  a  greater  temperature  as  400 ◦c  caused  many  intra-granular  cracks  in  quartz\\nand  feldspar  and  some  grain  boundary  cracks  between  quartz  and\\nfeldspar  minerals.  furthermore,  according  to  ae  analysis,  increasing  the  temperature  ﬁrst  causes  the  crack  propagation  stress\\nthreshold  to  increase  and  further  increasing  of  the  temperature\\ncauses  it  to  be  slightly  reduced.  this  indicates  a  suppression  of\\nmicro-cracks  at  low  temperatures  by  matrix  expansion  and  the\\ndevelopment  of  micro-cracks  through  thermally-induced  damage  at  higher  temperatures.\\n• finally  an  attempt  was  made  to  improve  the  conventional  mohrcoulomb  failure  criteria  for  geothermal  reservoirs  with  extreme\\npressures  and  temperatures,  because  the  conventional  criteria\\nare  not  applicable  to  extreme  conditions.\\n\\nacknowledgements\\n\\nthis  research  project  is  funded  by  the  australian  research  council  (arc dp160104223)  and  the  authors  would  like  to  thank  all  the\\ndeep  earth

criteria  are  available  for  intact\\nrock,  the  practical  application  of  most  of  them  for  geothermal\\nreservoirs \\nin-situ  model  parameters  required  when  considering  the  available  high-pressure  and\\nhigh-temperature  environment  in  underground  reservoirs.  of  the\\nvarious  failure  criteria,  the  mohr-coulomb  failure  criteria  have\\nbeen  extensively  used  in  the  ﬁeld  and  have  made  a  signiﬁcant  contribution  to  the  determination  of  rock  mass  failure.  however,  they\\nhave  some  major  limitations,  including  ignoring  the  intermediate\\nstress  (cid:2)2 inﬂuence  (which  has  been  proven  to  have  a  substantial\\ninﬂuence  on  rock  strength)  and  the  assumed  linearity  (the  strength\\ncriteria  of  rock  are  non-linear  in  reality).  after  re-analyzing  thousands  of  reported  triaxial  experiments  and  combining  the  critical\\nstate  concept  proposed  by  barton  (1976),  singh  et  al.  (2011)  proposed  a  non-linear  mohr-coulomb  failure  criterion.  according  to\\nthe  ﬁndings  of  singh  et  al.  (2011),  the  mohr-coulomb  shear  strength\\nparameters  should  only  be  obtained  by  performing  conventional\\ntri-axial  tests  under  low  conﬁning  stresses  (in  the  linear  region  of\\nthe  mohr-coulomb  failure  envelope).  according  to  their  statistical\\nanalysis,  (cid:2)cc ≈\\n  (cid:2)crit,  where  (cid:2)c and  (cid:2) crit are  uni-axial  compressive\\nstrength  and  critical  conﬁning  pressure,  respectively.  the  modiﬁed\\nmohr-coulomb  failure  criterion  proposed  by  singh  et  al.  is  given\\nbelow:\\n(cid:2)1 −\\n  (cid:2)3 =\\nwhere,  (cid:2)ci ≈\\n\\n

improved  mohr-coulomb  failure  criteria\\ncannot  be  directly  applied  to  geothermal  reservoir  rocks  at  extreme\\npressures  and  temperatures,  because  the  strength  response  is\\naltered  by  the  thermal  effect  (heuze,  1983).  to  date,  no  extensive\\nstudy  has  captured  this  thermal  response  in  the  improved  mohrcoulomb  failure  criteria.  such  a  realistic  approach  is  necessary\\nfor  deep  underground  engineering  applications  like  geothermal\\nenergy  extraction.  the  concepts  of  barton  (1976)  and  singh  et  al.\\n(2011)  are  therefore  incorporated  into  the  temperature  inﬂuence\\nin  this  study  and  an  attempt  is  made  to  propose  novel  strength  criteria  for  geothermal  reservoir  rocks  based  on  experimental  data:\\n\\n+

 dwivedi  et  al.,  2008).  however,  such  alterations  are also  affected  by  the  conﬁnement  applying  on  the  rock  mass,  and conﬁning  pressure  causes  the  suppression  of  thermal  cracks  and the  extension/widening  of  existing  micro-cracks.  this  results  in further  alteration  of  the  rock  mass  mechanical  properties,  resulting  in  changing  failure  modes  (mogi,  1966).  studies  have  identiﬁed the  transition  of  rock  failure  mode  from  brittle  to  ductile  with increasing  conﬁnement.  however,  this  transition  is  diverse  due  to the  different  mineralogical  compositions  and  grain  boundaries  in different  rocks  (klein  et  al.,  2001;  wong,  1982).  although  many  studies  have  been  conducted  to  investigate  the temperature-dependent  mechanical  behaviour  of  reservoir  rocks, most  experiments  have  been  conducted  in  unconﬁned  environments  (singh  et  al.,  2015;  shao  et  al.,  2014).  pre-heating  the specimens  to  the  corresponding  temperature  ranges  and  testing  at  room  temperatures  has  been  frequently  done  (bauer  and johnson,  1979;  xu  et  al.,  2008),  but  the  method  is  not  reliable, as  geothermal  reservoirs  experience  continuous  thermal  stresses. such  limitations  have  occurred  mainly  due  to  the  limited  number  of appropriate  test  facilities  available  to  simulate  the  stress  and  temperature  conditions  of  actual  geothermal  reservoirs.  although  some studies  have  analytically  and  numerically  evaluated  the  mechanical properties  of  rocks  under  high  temperatures  and  pressures  (chester and  higgs,  1992;  tian  et  al.,  2013;  vásárhelyi  et  al.,  2016),  to  date none  has  captured  the  stress-strain  behaviour  and  failure  criteria  of rocks  over  a  wide  range  of  conﬁning  pressures  and  temperatures, particularly  for  australian  granite.  however,  the  thermo-elastic response  and  appropriate  failure  criteria  are  essential  inputs  for many  engineering  applications  under  high  pressures  and  temperatures,  including  geothermal  extraction  applications.  this  study therefore  intends  to  ﬁll  this  gap,  and  it  is  hoped  it  will  make  an important  contribution  to  many  deep  underground  applications.  2.  methodology  2.1.  tested  material  granite  is  an  abundant  crystalline  rock  in  the  earth  with  medium to  coarse  grains  which  was  formed  as  a  result  of  the  slow  cooling of  magma.  granite  therefore  has  abundant  radioactive  elements (k,  th,  and  u).  such  elements  bring  elevated  geothermal  gradients to  deep  granite  reservoirs,  which  therefore  have  ideal  conditions as  geothermal  reservoirs.  the  mineralogical  composition  of  granite  mainly  consists  of  quartz,  feldspar,  plagioclase  and  biotite,  and small  amounts  of  muscovite,  amphibole,  hornblende  and  opaque (dwivedi  et  al.,  2008).  for  the  present  study,  samples  were  collected  from  the  strathbogie  batholith,  which  is  a  composite  granitoid  intrusion  body spreading  over  more  than  1500  km2 in  150  km  north-east  from melbourne  (fig.  1).  strathbogie  granite  is  a  high-level,  discordant  fig.  1.  sampling  location  of  strathbogie  batholith  in  central  victoria.  table  1 physical,  mechanical  and  petrographic  properties  of  strathbogie  granite  (obtained under  room  temperature  and  atmospheric  pressure  conditions).  rock  type   granite  colour  average  grain  size  petrographic  description   bulk  density  (kg/m3) compressive  strength  (mpa)  elastic  modulus  (gpa)  porosity  (%)   \\u242em  white  with  dark  brown 70–600  mainly  consists  of  feldspar,  biotite, quartz  and  plagioclase  equigranular, coarse  grained,  s-type  granite 2703.4 118.17 9.09 1.16  table  2 results  of  xrd  analysis.  mineral  id   alpha  quartz sodic  and  intermediate  plagioclase  biotite—phlogopite  k-feldspar  clinochlore  muscovite—sericite dolomite—ankerite  other  minerals   mass%  50 16 15 13 2 2 1 1  granite  that  mainly  consists  of  quartz,  k-feldspar,  cordierite  and biotite  (phillips  et  al.,  1981).  the  selected  granite  type  is  coarsegrained  and  white  and  dark  brown  in  colour  with  around  1.16% porosity.  fig.  2  presents  a  close-up  view  of  a  typical  strathbogie granite  sample,  an  optical  microscopic  image  and  an  sem  image of  its  thin  section.  as  can  be  seen  in  fig.  2(b),  clear  mineralogical assembling  can  be  observed  in  the  granite  specimen,  mainly  with quartz,  k-feldspar  and  plagioclase.  as  shown  in  fig.  3,  the  grain  size was  measured  from  a  thin  section  of  this  granite  and  found  to  be \\u242em  with  only  a  small  number mainly  in  the  range  of  0  mm–200  of  larger  grains  (>300  mm)   (shao  et  al.,  2014).  table  1  summarizes the  physical,  mechanical  and  petrographic  properties  of  the  tested strathbogie  granite.  in  addition,  an  xrd  analysis  was  conducted  to determine  the  mineralogical  composition  of  the  selected  granite and  the  result  is  shown  in  table  2.  as  the  table  shows,  quartz  is the  predominant  mineral  in  the  selected  granite  (50%),  followed  by 16%  of  sodic  and  intermediate  biotite  and  15%  of  plagioclase.  the mineralogical  composition  of  this  particular  granitic  composition is  representative  of  the  composition  of  the  majority  of  the  earth’s granites  (best,  1995).  all  the  physical  properties  in  tables  1  and  2  \\x0c46   w.g.p.  kumari  et  al.  /  geothermics  65  (2017)  44–59  fig.  2.

research  laboratory  (deerl)  in  the  civil  engineering  department  of  monash  university,  and  the  sample  preparation was  conducted  in  accordance  with  the  astm  standard  for  tri-axial compressive  testing  (astm  d7012-10  (2010)).  in  order  to  maintain consistency,  all  the  samples  were  cored  to  22.5  mm  in  diameter using  the  same  block  of  granite  at  the  same  orientation.  during  the sampling  great  care  was  taken  to  obtain  samples  with  the  same crystalline  orientation,  and  samples  with  different  crystalline  orientation,  internal  layers  and  visible  cracks  were  discarded.  it  should be  noted  that  coring-induced  rock-microstructure  alteration  is  an important  aspect  to  consider  in  laboratory  experiments,  although few  studies  have  considered  this  effect.  to  avoid  such  issues,  a  very small  coring  rate  was  adopted  and  water  was  used  as  a  lubricant. the  cored  specimens  were  then  cut  into  45  mm  high  cylinders  and both  ends  of  the  specimens  were  ground  to  produce  two  parallel surfaces  perpendicular  to  the  axes  of  the  cylindrical  specimens.  2.3.  experimental  procedure  tri-axial  experiments  were  conducted  on  samples  under  four different  conﬁning  pressures  (10,  30,  60  and  90  mpa)  and  four different  temperatures  (rt,  100,  200,  300 ◦c).  these  experimental  conditions  were  selected,  because  the  most  preferable  hot  dry rock  systems  are  generally  located  at  depths  of  2.5–3.5  km  and have  around  70  mpa–120  mpa   conﬁning  pressures  (assuming  the reservoir  rock  density  is  equal  to  2500  kg/m3)  and  temperatures  of  200–350 ◦c  (breede  et  al.,  2013).  the  different  conﬁning  pressures and  temperatures  were  selected  to  simulate  the  reservoir  depth effect  and  to  obtain  a  sufﬁcient  data  set  to  understand  the  failure criteria  under  different  temperatures.  the  complete  arrangement  of  the  tri-axial  cell  is  shown  in fig.  3.  the  prepared  sample  was  ﬁrst  placed  inside  the  cell  and  the required  conﬁning  pressure  was   then  applied  using  a  silicon  oil  system,  and  an  annealed  copper  sleeve  was  used  to  isolate  the  sample from  the  conﬁning  liquid  (refer  to  fig.  3(b).  a  mica-insulated  metal band  heater  was   used  to  heat  the  pressure  cell  and  consequently the  rock  sample.  the  temperatures  of  the  cell  were  adjusted  using  a controller  and  a  constant  small  heating  rate  of  2.5 ◦c/min  was  used to  prevent  micro-structural  damage  due  to  sudden  thermal  shocks. two  separate  thermocouples  were  used  to  achieve  precise  temperature  control,  and  the  reading  of  the  thermocouple  installed  inside the  cell  (fig.  3(b))  was   recorded  by  the  data  acquisition  system.  the other  thermocouple  that  was   attached  to  the  barrel  (fig.  3(a))  was used  to  control  the  band  heater.  furthermore,  the  barrel  and  the top  of  the  pressure  cell  were  covered  using  an  insulating  blanket to  reduce  heat  loss  during  the  experiments  and  to  minimise  the inﬂuence  of  air  ﬂows  towards  the  cell.  all  the  tests  were  started once  the  system  had  achieved  a  steady  state  to  ensure  uniformity in  temperature  and  pressure  across  the  sample.  equilibrium  was ensured  by  monitoring  the  conﬁnement  pump  volume  and  the thermocouple  readings  inside  the  cell  (located  very  close  to  the specimen).  under  steady-state  conditions,  constant  pump  volume and  constant  temperature  were  observed  and  testing  was   initiated. a   constant  loading  pump  ﬂow  rate  of  1  ml/min  was  adopted  for all  the  test  specimens  and  the  converted  displacement  rate  was 0.05  mm/min.  it  should  be  noted  that  a  small  shaft  resistance  exists as  a  result  of  the  sealing  of  the  hydraulic  cylinder,  and  this  effect was  considered  in  the  calibration  of  the  loading  cell.  the  sealing resistance  was  obtained  by  measuring  the  pump  pressure  to  initiate  a  movement  in  the  loading  shaft,  and  this  was   deducted  from each  pressure  reading  to  eliminate  the  resistance  of  the  sealing  dur\\x0cw.g.p.  kumari  et  al.  /  geothermics  65  (2017)  44–59   47  using  the  typical  mohr-coulomb  brittle  deformation.  the  deviatoric stress-strain  plots  of  the  granite  samples  (fig.  4)  exhibited  concave upward  curvilinear  trends  from  initial  loading  to  the  peak  value, beyond  which  strain  softening  occurred,  causing  a  rapid  stress  drop to  a  residual  value.  increasing  peak  stress  with  increasing  conﬁning  pressure  can  be  observed,  which  is  to  be  expected,  according to  typical  mohr-coulomb  type  brittle  failure  (paterson  and  wong, 2005).  traditionally,  rock  failure  in  compression  can  occur  in  two main  ways;  (a)  dilatancy  and  failure  by  strain  softening  under relatively  low  conﬁning  pressures  and  (b)  failure  by  strain  hardening  under  elevated  conﬁning  pressures,  and  a  transitional  regime may   be  observed  at  intermediate  pressures.  these  transitional  failure  modes  have  been  referred  to  as  “quasi-brittle”,  and  complex localized  features  such  as  conjugate  shear  bands  can  be  observed under  such  conditions  (klein  et  al.,  2001;  gajo  et  al.,  2004).  by visual  inspection  of  the  post-failure  samples,  important  information  about  the  alteration  of  the  granite  failure  mechanism  with conﬁning  pressures  and  temperatures  can  be  identiﬁed.  postfailure  images  (fig.  5)  were  therefore  collected  after  each  test.  according  to  the  post-failure  images,  specimens  that  failed at  10–60  mpa   conﬁning  pressures  mainly  failed  by  shear  localization  along  an  inclined  macroscopic  shear  band  with  a  single shear  zone  across  each  sample.  however,  samples  tested  at  higher conﬁnements  of  90  mpa   and  120  mpa   (at  100 ◦c)  exhibited  strain hardening  characteristics  after  achieving  the  peak  stress,  and  several  conjugate  shear  bands  could  be  observed  on  the  cylindrical sample  surface,  instead  of  the  single  shear  band  observed  earlier. this  characteristic  was  signiﬁcant  at  120  mpa   conﬁning  pressure. however,  it  should  be  noted  that  only  one  test  was   conducted at  120  mpa   conﬁnement,  because  at  such  high  conﬁning  pressures  the  corresponding  failure  load  of  granite  exceeds  the  bottom pedestal’s  load-bearing  capacity.  further,  a  progressive  reduction was  observed  in  the  failure  plane  angle  with  respect  to  the  minor principal  stress  direction  with  increasing  conﬁning  pressure,  which implies  a  reduction  in  friction  angle,  possibly  due  to  the  greater quasi-brittle  behaviour  that  was   shown  by  granite  samples  at higher  conﬁning  pressures  (wong  et  al.,  2001).  3.2.  effect  of  temperature  and  conﬁning  pressure  on  mechanical properties  of  strathbogie  granite  fig.  6  illustrates  the  inﬂuence  of  temperature  on  the  deviatoric stress  of  the  tested  granite  under  each  conﬁnement.  as  the  ﬁgure  shows,  the  inﬂuence  of  conﬁnement  is  more  signiﬁcant  than that  of  temperature  in  the  temperature  range  considered  here. wong  and  brace  (1979)  conﬁrm  that  at  lower  conﬁning  pressures considerable  thermal  cracking  occurs  at  relatively  low  temperatures.  if  thermal  cracking  is  responsible  for  the  reduction  in  failure strength,  a  sharp  reduction  in  deviatoric  stress  with  increasing temperature  (with  suppression  of  thermal  cracks)  should  be  exhibited  under  unconﬁned  pressure  condition.  however,  based  on  the experimental  results,  under  unconﬁned  conditions,  up  to  100 ◦c, 17.6%  of  increment  in  deviatoric  stress  is  followed  by  2.5%  and 10.5%  reductions  at  200 ◦c  and  300 ◦c,  respectively.  however,  when conﬁnement  was  applied,  strength  reduction  was  initiated  after   higher  temperature  of  200 ◦c,  mainly  due  to  the  inhibition  of a thermal  cracks  by  induced  compressive  force.  thermal  cracking  is therefore  an  important  strength  property  alteration  mechanism  in reservoir  rocks  under  certain  conﬁning  pressure  conditions.  a    clear  inﬂuence  of  temperature  on  deviatoric  stress  at  any depth  or  conﬁnement  can  be  observed,  and  increasing  the  temperature  from  room  temperature  to  200 ◦c  causes  an  increment  in deviatoric  stress,  and  further  increasing  of  temperature  to  300 ◦c causes  a  slight  reduction  in  it.  this  is  because  the  thermal  expansion which  occurs  with  increasing  temperature  causes  the  reduction

resistance  is  negligible  which  is  only  0.19% of  maximum  measurement.  during  the  load  application,  the  axial strain  was  measured  using  linear  variable  differential  transducers (lvdts)  attached  to  the  ram  of  the  load  cell  (fig.  3(a)).  an  acoustic  emission  (ae)  system  was  also  employed  in  the  testing  of  samples  to  record  the  data  related  to  the  fracturing  process. the  ae  system  adopted  was  a  peripheral  component  interconnection  (pci)  system  with  a  nominal  resolution  frequency  of  500  khz. during  the  experiments,  two  sensors  were  attached  to  either  side  of the  loading  shaft  and  with  the  external  ampliﬁers,  which  generated low  frequency  acoustic  waves  with  the  fracturing  of  the  sample.  in addition,  possible  micro-structural  and  mineralogical  changes  that occurred  during  thermal  and  conﬁnement  effects  were  checked using  sem  analyses.  3.  results  and  discussion  3.1.

pressure.  the  reductions  of  strength  characteristics  were relatively  small  up  to  500 ◦c  and  beyond  that  an  accelerated  downward  trend  was  identiﬁed.  furthermore,  wider  localized  zones were  observed  at  high  temperatures  in  the  post-failure  images. however,  these  studies  were  conducted  at  wider  temperature ranges  (up  to  700 ◦c  and  900 ◦c,  respectively)  and  the  researchers therefore  did  not  pay  close  attention  to  reservoir  rock  behaviour under  relatively  low  geothermal  temperature  ranges  (<300 ◦c).  this was  the  focus  of  the  present  study,  according  to  which  there  is an  initial  strengthening  and  stiffening  in  granite  with  increasing temperature  at  low  temperatures  (up  to  200 ◦c),  and  increasing the  temperature  beyond  a  certain  value  causes  a  gradual  reduction  in  failure  stress  with  increasing  temperature.  elastic  modulus is  an  important  mechanical  property  of  any  reservoir  rock,  and  describes  the  brittle  characteristics  of  the  rock  mass.  it  is  therefore often  used  to  evaluate  many  in-situ  stress  applications,  including wellbore  stability,  fracturing  possibility  and  tectonic  stress  distribution  (heard  and  page,  1982).  the  temperature-dependent  brittle properties  (elastic  modulus)  of  the  tested  granite  were  then  evaluated.  the  elastic  region  of  each  stress-strain  curve  was  used  to calculate  the  temperature and  pressure-dependent  young’s  moduli  (e)  and  the  results  are  shown  in  fig.  7.  the  axial  strain  was measured  using  lvdts  attached  to  the  loading  ram  with  a  linearity ±0.1%  f.s  (full  scale)  (±0.0075  mm)   and  inﬁnite  resoluerror  of  tion  (no  hysteresis).  an  increment  of  the  modulus  of  strathbogie granite  with  increasing  temperature  up  to  200 ◦c  can  be  observed, and  further  increase  of  temperature  (to  300 ◦c)  causes  the  elastic modulus  to  be  slightly  reduced  for  any  conﬁnement.  this  trend  is  \\x0ca  ‘brittle’  or     general  increment  in  elastic  modulus  with  increasing  conﬁnement  can  be  observed  until  90  mpa,  and  a  further  increase of  conﬁnement  (to  120  mpa)  reduces  the  young’s  modulus  considerably.  with  increasing  conﬁning  stress  additional  plastic deformation  occurs,  exhibiting  strain-hardening  characteristics  in granite  under  high  conﬁnements.  however,  within  the  range  of the  experiments  conducted  (10  mpa–120  mpa)  it  cannot  be  deﬁnitively  identiﬁed  as  a  ’ductile’  regime.  however,  the strain-hardening  behaviour  observed  at  120  mpa   indicates  transitional  characteristics  and  this  can  be  identiﬁed  as  ‘quasi-brittle’ behaviour  (klein  et  al.,  2001).  the  initial  young’s  modulus  reduction  with  increasing  conﬁnement  was  observed  by  heard  and  page (1982),  who   conducted  tests  up  to  55  mpa   conﬁning  pressure.  however,  the  latter  behaviour  was  not  observed  by  these  researchers. interestingly,  according  to  the  research  literature,  at  low  temperatures  (<200 ◦c)  some  granite  types  are  more  temperature-sensitive, while  in  contrast,  some  granites  are  more  temperature-sensitive at  high  temperatures.  the  initial  strength  enhancement  is  more signiﬁcant  for  coarse-grained  granites  and  granodiorite  than  for ﬁne-grained  granites.  for  example,  according  to  heard  and  page (1982),  stripa  granite  is  more  sensitive  to  temperature  at  relatively  low  temperatures  (<200 ◦c),  and  westerly  granite  is  more sensitive  to  temperature  at  high  temperatures  (>200 ◦c).  such  contradictory  behaviours  may   occur  in  granite  due  to  the  different grain  size  distributions,  grain  orientations,  mineralogical  compositions  and  heterogeneity  of  different  granite  types.  this  indicates  the importance  of  studying  the  mineralogical  composition  and  microstructural  inﬂuence  of  granites  on  such  on  temperature-dependent strength  variations.  3.3.  effect  of  temperature  on  shear  strength  parameters  of strathbogie  granite  fig.  8  illustrates  the  variation  of  deviatoric  stress  of  the  tested granite  with  conﬁning  pressure  for  each  temperature.  the  ﬁgure shows  that  increasing  conﬁnement  causes  the  granite’s  deviatoric stress  to  increase  non-linearly  and  gradually  come  to  a  steady  state. this  is  consistent  with  similar  previous  studies,  which  have  clearly shown  the  enhancement  of  rock  strength  with  increasing  conﬁnement,  and  the  increasing  rate  is  reduced  with  increasing  conﬁning pressure  (barton,  2013;  singh  et  al.,  2011).  this  is  because  at  low conﬁning  pressures  there  is  a  high  dilation  potential.  therefore,  the ability  to  open  rock  micro-cracks  is  high,  resulting  in  higher  friction  angles.  however,  this  dilation  potential  and  the  corresponding tendency  for  micro-cracks  to  open  are  suppressed  with  increasing conﬁnement,  resulting  in  lower  friction  angles  at  higher  conﬁning  pressures.  therefore,  the  failure  mechanism  of  the  rocks  shifts from  brittle  to  ductile  with  increasing  conﬁnement,  changing  the shape  of  the  mohr-coulomb  failure  envelope,  and  according  to barton  (1976),  at  critical  conﬁning  pressure  the  mohr-coulomb  failure  envelope  reaches  a  zero  gradient.  this  has  also  been  shown by  hoek  (1983).  the  present  study  has  clearly  identiﬁed  this  rock behaviour  in  the  mohr-coulomb  failure  envelopes  developed  for each  temperature  condition  (refer  to  fig.  9).  according  to  fig.  9, the  traditional  linear  mohr-coulomb  criteria  are  applicable  only  in the  brittle  region  of  the  failure  envelope,  and  at  higher  conﬁnew.g.p.  kumari  et  al.  /  geothermics  65  (2017)  44–59  consistent  with  the  temperature-dependent  strength  behaviour  of the  granite  described  above.  the  reason  for  the  initial  elastic  module  increment  may  be  that  the  specimen  becomes  more  brittle  at the  initial  temperature  ranges  due  to  thermally-induced  volumetric  expansion  and  the  associated  pore  volume  reduction.  the  later slight  reduction  of  young’s  modulus  with  increasing  temperature exhibits  an  enhancement  in  ductile  behaviour  (quasi-brittle  characteristics)  with  further  increase  of  temperature.  this  is  possibly due  to  the  increased  crack  density  caused  by  the  induced  thermal crack  development  and  the  related  weakening  of  the  granite.  600  500

weakening  of  the  grain  boundaries,  dependent  on the  anisotropy  of  the  rock  matrix  (due  to  potentially  existing  distinct  mineral  compounds  in  granite  those  may   contain  different thermo-elastic  moduli  and  this  may   causes  to  generate  different  internal  stresses  with  heating).  according  to  wong  and  brace (1979),  increasing  the  temperature  causes  the  induction  of  thermal cracks  in  the  rock  mass  due  to  the  associated  generation  of  internal stresses  (eq.  (2)):  (2)  e(cid:4)˛(cid:4)t   =   \\u2434     where,  e,  \\x01␣,   \\x01t   is  the  matrix  young’s  modulus,  difference  of thermal  expansion  coefﬁcient  of  distinct  mineral  and  temperature difference,  respectively.  when  the  internal  stress  (given  by  eq.  (2)) exceeds  the  crack  closure  pressure  with  increasing  temperature, thermal  cracks  form  and  further  increase  of  temperature  provides the  surface  energy  required  for  the  propagation  of  the  initiated crack  (zuo  et  al.,  2007).  this  results  in  alteration  of  the  grain-tograin  contacts  in  the  rock  matrix,  which  leads  to  reduced  cohesion at  higher  temperatures.  in  the  case  of  the  variation  of  friction  angle with  increasing  temperature,  the  granite  friction  angle  appears  to remain  steady  up  to  around  100 ◦c  (52◦)  and  then  slightly  increases with  increasing  temperature  (54◦ at  200  and  300 ◦ c,  respectively). the  friction  between  grain-to-grain  contacts  may  be  altered  by the  thermally-induced  micro-structural  modiﬁcations.  however, this  effect  on  grain  contact  is  expected  to  be  smaller  at  relatively low  temperatures,  resulting  in  relatively  steady  friction  angle  with increasing  temperature  at  lower  temperatures.  however,  a  slight  ments  non-linearity  must  be  taken  into  account.  in  addition  to  the conﬁnement,  according  to  this  study,  increasing  temperature  also alters  the  failure  envelope  of  granite.  an  initial  increment  in  deviatoric  stress  with  increasing  temperature  can  be  observed  up  to 200 ◦c  and  further  increase  of  temperature  (to  300 ◦c)  causes  it  to be  slightly  reduced.  the  temperature-dependent  shear  parameters  of  granite  were investigated  next,  and  the  shear  parameters  can  be  obtained from  the  mohr-coulomb  failure  envelope.  as  suggested  by  singh et  al.  (2011),  the  mohr-coulomb  parameters  (cohesion  and  friction  angle)  were  calculated  using  eq.  (1),  taking  into  account  the linear  region  of  the  obtained  mohr-coulomb  failure  envelope  (considering  only  smaller  conﬁning  stresses,  up  to  30  mpa)  for  each temperature  condition  to  obtain  the  temperature-dependent  shear strength  parameters  (fig.  10).

(continued)  enhancement  in  friction  angle  with  increasing  temperature  can  be seen,  probably  due  to  the  increased  resistance  of  mineral  particles to  external  deformation  as  a  result  of  the  thermally-induced  energy in  the  mineral  particles.  however,  compared  with  cohesion,  the temperature  dependency  on  friction  angle  is  relatively  insigniﬁcant within  the  temperature  region  considered  here.  initial  enhancement  in  shear  parameters  in  sandstone  with increasing  temperature  has  been  observed  by  zhang  et  al.  (2015)  at relatively  low  temperature  regions,  and  these  researchers  observed   reduction  in  friction  angle  from  33.02◦ to  31.93◦ and  an  increment a in  cohesion  from  61.47  mpa   to  66.44  mpa   with  increasing  temperature  from  25 ◦c  to  100 ◦c.  further,  bauer  and  johnson  (1979) observed  around  10%  reduction  in  cohesion  and  40%  reduction  in friction  angle  in  westerly  granite  with  increasing  temperature  from room  temperature  to  300 ◦c,  and  friedman  et  al.  (1979)  observed   7%  reduction  in  cohesion  and  a  38%  reduction  in  friction  angle a with  increasing  temperature  from  room  temperature  to  400 ◦c and  300 ◦c,  respectively.  however,  the  variation  of  shear  strength parameters  with  increasing  temperature  at  relatively  low  temperatures  (<300 ◦c)  was  not  considered  in  the  above  studies.  the observed  initial  shear  strengthening  may   be  due  to  the  inhibition  of micro-crack  propagation  by  the  plasticity  mechanism  which  occurs at  crack  tips  (duclos  and  paquet  (1991))  at  low  temperatures.  with further  increment  of  temperature,  the  reduction  of  shear  strength parameters  can  be  expected,  due  to  the  thermal  weakening  of  the rock  micro-structure.  furthermore,  according  to  the  sem  studies conducted  by  zuo  et  al.  (2007),  large  local  plastic  deformations  and extremely  rough  cleavage  fractures  occur  at  relatively  low  temperatures.  moreover,  due  to  the  volume  expansion,  the  distance between  the  interfaces  of  the  individual  minerals  decreases  with the  enhancement  of  their  mutual  attraction,  and  the  strength  of the  bonds  increases  (dmitriev,  1972).  both  of  these  phenomena  can  be  considered  to  explain  the  stress  strengthening  of  granite  under relatively  low  temperatures  when  subjected  to  conﬁning  pressures.  3.4.  analysis  of  fracturing  behaviour  using  ae  technology  acoustic  emission  (ae)  detection  technology  is  a  powerful  nondestructive  tool  to  study  crack  propagation  processes  in  brittle materials,  including  the  stages  of  crack  initiation,  growth  and  crack damage  (lockner,  1993).  when  a  brittle  material  is  under  stress, strain  energy  is  released  during  the  development  of  new  cracks  or the  widening  of  existing  cracks.  this  energy  is  released  in  the  form of  elastic  stress  waves  from  the  crack  tips,  and  can  be  captured  and ampliﬁed  by  an  ae  system.  ae  detection  technology  has  therefore been  widely  used  in  a  number  of  previous  studies  to  understand the  crack  development  mechanism  in  brittle  materials  (chang  and lee,  2004;  lei  et  al.,  2000;  moura  et  al.,  2005).  by  incorporating  the  crack  propagation  pattern  into  the  stressstrain  relationship  of  the  cracking  material,  the  crack  development process  can  be  divided  into  several  stages.  hoek  and  bieniawski (1965)  divided  crack  formation  into  ﬁve  main  stages:  crack  closure,  crack  initiation,  secondary  cracking,  crack  coalescence  and crack  damage.  later,  ranjith  et  al.  (2008)  and  shao  et  al.  (2015) incorporated  stress-strain  curves  into  cumulative  ae  counts/energy and  strain  plots.  in  the  crack  propagation  process,  with  the  gradual increment  of  loading  on  brittle  materials,  most  pre-existing  cracks are  ﬁrst  closed,  releasing  an  insigniﬁcant  number  of  ae  counts. this  initial  crack  closure  period  is  followed  by  the  stable  crack propagation  period,  which  can  be  identiﬁed  by  the  release  of  gradual  ae  energy  increments.  further  increment  of  loading  causes  an exponential  increase  in  ae  energy,  indicating  an  unstable  crack propagation  period  with  failure  approaching.  the  crack  closure threshold  ((cid:2)cc)  is  deﬁned  as  the  stress  threshold  at  which  the  initial ae  counts  are  identiﬁed.  anan  initial  increment  in  cumulative  ae  \\x0c54   w.g.p.  kumari  et  al.  /  geothermics  65  (2017)  44–59  counts  can  be  seen  at  the  crack  initiation  ((cid:2)ci)  threshold,  and  the cumulative  ae  counts  starts  exponential  growth  at  the  crack  damage  ((cid:2)cd)  threshold.  the  region  between  the  crack  closure  threshold and  the  crack  initiation  threshold  is  generally  deﬁned  as  the  stable crack  closure  region,  where  linear  elastic  deformation  occurs.  the region  between  the  crack  initiation  threshold  and  the  crack  damage  threshold  is  deﬁned  as  the  stable  crack  propagation  region,  and the  region  between  the  crack  damage  threshold  and  sample  failure is  identiﬁed  as  the  unstable  crack  propagation  region.  the  application  of  compressive  loading  fails  rocks  through  either shear  localization  (brittle  regime)  or  cataclastic  ﬂow,  and  the  surrounding  conditions,  such  as  temperatures  and  pressures,  may cause  a  homogenous  plastic  ﬂow.  according  to  existing  studies, axial  intra-granular  cracking  and  shear  rupturing  of  cemented  grain contacts  can  be  observed  before  failure  in  brittle  regimes,  and  grain crushing  and  pore  collapse  can  be  identiﬁed  before  failure  in  cataclastic  ﬂow  regimes  (menéndez  et  al.,  1996).  according  to  wong et  al.  (1997),  the  development  of  local  stress  concentrations  leads to  the  initiation  of  many  intra-granular  micro-cracks  in  the  rock mass,  and  the  crack  density  increases  with  increasing  deviatoric stress  and  tends  to  merge  on  reaching  the  peak  stress,  resulting  in strain  softening  and  shear  localization.  these  damage  processes  are clearly  identiﬁed  by  the  intense  ae  activities  in  the  ﬁeld  (chang  and lee,  2004).  ae  technology  was  therefore  used  to  investigate  the  progressive  fracturing  behaviour  in  strathbogie  granite  under  tri-axial conditions.  fig.  11  illustrates  the  cumulative  ae  events  with  axial stress  at  various  pressures  and  temperatures  for  the  tested  specimens.  the  corresponding  variations  of  deviatoric  stress  against strain  are  also  included  in  the  same  plots  to  identify  the  stress thresholds  for  crack  closure,  crack  initiation  and  crack  damage (table  4).  the  very  high  ae  counts  in  strathbogie  granite  at  dilatancy in  the  pre-failure  stage  are  due  to  the  fact  that  ae  waves  generate when  the  local  shear  stress  concentration  at  a  grain  contact  is  sufﬁciently  high  to  rupture  the  grain  boundaries,  and  frictional  slips and  grain  rotations  may   occur  once  the  grain  contacts  have  lost their  cohesion.  in  the  present  study,  crack  threshold  ratios  were  deﬁned  to  identify  the  temperature  and  pressure-dependent  crack  propagation  in the  tested  granite  as  follows,  and  fig.  12  shows  the  crack  propagation  stress  threshold  ratios  of  granite  specimens  tested  at  various conﬁning  pressures  and  temperatures.  crack  closure  stress  threshold   = deviatoric  stress  at  crack  closure  stress   deviatoric  stress  at  failure  ((cid:2)cc)  crack  initiation  stress  threshold   = deviatoric  stress  at  crack  initiation  stress   deviatoric  stress  at  failure  ((cid:2)ci)  crack  damage  stress  threshold   = deviatoric  stress  at  crack  damage  stress  ((cid:2)cd)  deviatoric  stress  at  failure  according  to  the  results,  the  beginning  of  crack  damage  occurs at  earlier  stages  of  deviatoric  loading  for  higher  conﬁning  pressures.  however,  the  crack  damage  stress  increases  with  increasing conﬁnement  due  to  the  inﬂuence  of  conﬁning  pressure  on  thermal crack  development  and  the  suppression  of  the  extension/widening of  existing  micro-cracks.  according  to  fig.  12,  in  the  temperature  range  considered  here,  three  tendencies  can  be  identiﬁed with  increasing  conﬁning  pressure:  increase  of  the  elastic  deformation  region,  decrease  of  the  stable  crack  propagation  region,  and increase  of  the  unstable  crack  propagation  region.  the  crack  initiation  stress  threshold  also  progressively  increases  with  increasing conﬁning  pressure,  which  can  be  attributed  to  the  fact  that  the brittle  behaviour  of  rock  specimens  at  lower  conﬁning  pressures changes  to  quasi-brittle  behaviour  with  increasing  conﬁning  pressure.  this  is  because  the  suppression  of  micro-crack  development is  less  at  low  conﬁning  pressures,  and  therefore  sudden  failures  mostly  occur,  and  the  beginning  of  crack  initiation  occurs  at  earlier  stages  of  deviatoric  loading  at  high  conﬁning  pressures due  to  the  higher  normal  stress  acting  on  micro-cracks,  resulting  in  limited  progression  of  cracking  before  failure.  in  relation to  the  temperature  effect,  increasing  the  temperature  causes  an initial  increment  in  the  crack  propagation  stress  threshold,  followed  by  a  slight  reduction  for  all  the  temperature  conditions considered.  for  example,  at  30  mpa   conﬁnement,  the  crack  damage  stress  threshold  ratios  increased  by  around  6.8%,  10.5%  with increasing  temperature  from  room  temperature  to  100  and  200 ◦c, respectively,  and  reduced  by  around  4.0%  when  the  temperature increased  to  300 ◦c.  this  implies  that  at  low  temperatures  a  suppressed  micro-crack  development  mechanism  is  dominant,  and increasing  the  temperature  causes  crack  damage  to  occur  at  earlier  loading  stages.  interestingly,  at  60  mpa   conﬁnement  the  crack damage  stress  threshold  ratio  increased  by  around  4.9%,  5.4%, 2.6%  with  increasing  temperature  from  room  to  100,  200  and 300 ◦c,  respectively.  this  exhibits  the  cumulative  effect  of  temperature  and  pressure  micro-crack  development  in  the  rock  mass. at  relatively  low  temperatures,  micro-crack  propagation  may  be inhibited  by  the  thermally-induced  plasticity  mechanism  which occurs  at  crack  tips  and  the  increased  bonding  strength  through thermally-induced  rock  matrix  expansion  (which  increases  crack stress  thresholds).  however,  further  increase  of  temperature  creates  thermally-induced  cracks  and  causes  the  grain  boundary cracks  to  widen,  resulting  in  early  crack  damage.  further,  with  the inﬂuence  of  conﬁnement,  micro-crack  development  is  suppressed, causing  a  relatively  low  increment  of  crack  damage  stress  threshold ratios  at  higher  conﬁnements.  3.5.  corresponding  alterations  in  granite  micro-structure  a    comprehensive  micro-structural  analysis  was   also  performed to  identify  the  interior  correspondences  of  the  above-described temperature-dependent  mechanical  behaviour  of  granite.  sem  and optical  microscopic  analyses  were  performed  on  thin  sections of  granite  specimens  at  various  temperatures:  room  temperature  (20 ◦c),  pre-heated  (72  hours)  to  200 ◦c  and  400 ◦c  (fig.  13). these  temperatures  were  selected  to  identify  the  microstructural behaviour  at  200 ◦c,  at  which  the  highest  strength  increment  was observed,  and  400 ◦c,  at  which  clear  thermally-induced  rock  mass weakening  was  observed.  a  specimen  at  room  temperature  was used  as  a  control.  based  on  optical  microscope  imaging,  mineralogical  assembling in  the  granite  specimen  could  be  identiﬁed  by  the  colour  and  texture  of  each  of  the  mineral  assemblages.  further,  a  detailed  sem study  was   performed  using  scanning  electron  imaging  (sei)  and bsei  back-scatter  electron  imaging  (bsei)  techniques.  bsei  images taken  at  low  magniﬁcations  clearly  show  different  mineral  assemblages  and  grain  boundaries  (see  fig.  14).  using  energy-dispersive x-ray  (edx)  technology  with  aztec  oxford  instruments,  chemical  component  mapping  was  generated  in  each  specimen,  and each  mineral  was  identiﬁed  qualitatively.  the  bright  colour  images observed  in  edx  images  indicate  higher  concentration  (higher energy  dispersion)  while  dark  colour  areas  indicate  lower  concentration  (lower  energy  dispersion).  based  on  the  spectrum  of  each point  (point  id),  the  corresponding  mineral  was  identiﬁed  and  a map   spectrum  provided  overall  elements  available  for  each  specimen.  according  to  figs.  13  and  14,  there  are  clear  mineralogical assembling  in  the  granite  specimens,  mainly  with  quartz,  kfeldspar  and  plagioclase.  the  heating  of  granite  up  to  200 ◦c temperature  has  not  caused  any  signiﬁcant  thermally-induced micro-cracks  (in  addition  to  the  pre-existing  faults  and  grain boundaries)  and  almost  all  grain  boundaries  remain  intact.  however,  further  heating  of  granite  to  the  higher  temperature  of 400 ◦c  caused  the  induction  of  some  micro-cracks,  mainly  along  \\x0cw.g.p.  kumari  et  al.  /  geothermics  65  (2017)  44–59   55  table   4 stress  thresholds  for  different  fracturing  stages.  temperature

have  been  partially  parted  and  a  signiﬁcant  number of  grain  boundaries  appear  to  remain  intact  up  to  this  temperature.  furthermore,  based  on  the  edx  mapping,  it  was   conﬁrmed that  intra-granular  cracks  are  mainly  initiated  along  the  feldspar and  quartz  minerals.  intragranular  cracks  were  mainly  observed in  larger  crystals  (crystals  greater  than  0.5  mm)   and  smaller  crystals  remained  un-parted  even  at  400 ◦c.  for  strathbogie  granite, thermally-induced  intra-granular  micro-cracks  seem  to  play  a  signiﬁcant  role  at  relatively  low  temperatures,  probably  due  to  the presence  of  relatively  high  k  feldspar  and  biotite  contents.  similar  observations  have  been  reported  in  bauer  and  johnson’s  (1979) study  conducted  for  charcoal  granite,  where  intra-granular  microcracks  predominantly  occur  compared  to  grain  boundary  cracks. the  sem  analysis  is  also  consistent  with  this  ﬁnding,  which  exhibits inhibition  of  micro-crack  development  followed  by  micro-cracking at  relatively  high  temperatures.  the  crack  propagation  process  in  any  rock  mass  is  largely inﬂuenced  by  the  mineralogical  composition,  because  cracks  normally  propagate  through  weaker  planes  of  the  rock  mass.  since granite  is  an  igneous  type  of  rock,  two  main  types  of  thermallyinduced  cracking  modes  can  be  identiﬁed:  inter-granular  and  intragranular.  the  amount  of  inter-granular  or  intra-granular  cracking is  dependent  on  the  stress  state,  rock  type  and  mineralogy  of the  rock  mass.  inter-granular  cracks  occur  along  grain  boundaries, pre-existing  faults  and  micro-cracks  of  the  rock,  while  intragranular  cracks  occur  through  weaker  mineralogical  constituents (kranz,  1983).  for  example,  k feldspar  and  biotite  are  weaker  mineralogical  constituents  due  to  their  large  crystals  (>10  mm), as  crystals  greater  than  2–3  mm  in  size  are  generally  deﬁned  as weaker  mineralogical  constituents  compared  to  equi-dimensional small  crystals  like  quartz  (homand-etienne  and  houpert,  1989). based  on  experimental  results,  intra-granular  cracking  is  highly temperature-dependent  due  to  the  temperature dependent  dislocations  in  the  rocks.  this  is  because  different  mineralogical components  have  different  thermo-elastic  moduli  and  thermal conductivities  (kranz,  1983;  dwivedi  et  al.,  2008).  these  observations  suggest  that  micro-cracking  in  granite  is highly  temperature dependent,  as  evidenced  by  the  previously observed  initial  strength  gain  followed  by  slight  strength  reduction  with  increasing  temperature  in  the  tested  granite.  however, this  shows  that  granite  needs  to  be  heated  to  a  sufﬁcient  temperature  to  cause  thermal  cracks  in  it  and  therefore,  heating  to  a  lower temperature  may   only  cause  a  strength  gain  through  the  thermal expansion  of  the  rock  matrix.  this  is  consistent  with  the  results of  bauer  and  johnson  (1979).  the  mechanical  properties  of  charcoal  granite  in  their  study  remained  relatively  steady  until  200 ◦c, and  westerly  granite  exhibited  a  signiﬁcant  thermal  dependency, even  at  relatively  low  temperatures  (<200 ◦c).  in  homand-etienne and  houpert  (1989)  study,  the  variation  of  uni-axial  compressive strength  of  both  semones  and  remiremont  granites  is  insigniﬁcant until  400 ◦c,  followed  by  signiﬁcant  reductions  at  higher  temperatures.  these  results  indicate  the  dependency  of  mineralogical composition  and  grain  size  distribution  on  the  temperature dependent  mechanical  behaviour  in  various  types  of  granites.  however,  \\x0cw.g.p.  kumari  et  al.  /  geothermics  65  (2017)  44–59   57  fig.  14.  bse  images  of  strathbogie  granite  with  edx  mapping:  (a)

granite  under  four  different  conﬁning  pressures  (10,  30, 60,  90  mpa)  and  four  different  temperatures  (rt,  100,  200,  300 ◦c), simulating  various  geothermal  reservoir  conditions.  the  following conclusions  can  be  drawn:   mechanical  behaviour  of  the  tested  granite  is  inﬂuenced  by  both reservoir  depth  and  temperature,  and  the  depth  effect  is  much greater  than  the  temperature  effect.   granite  located  at  relatively  smaller  depths  appears  to  fail through  shear  localization  and  increasing  depth  may  cause  this to  change  to  ductile  failure  through  strain  hardening.  a  progressive  enhancement  in  stress  threshold  with  increasing  conﬁning pressure  is  observed  in  strathbogie  granite.  such  behaviours exhibit  greater  strength  and  lower  brittle  characteristics  in  granite  located  at  greater  depths.   increasing  of  temperature  causes  granite’s  strength  to  be enhanced  up  to  a  certain  temperature  (around  200 ◦c  for  strathbogie  granite)  through  the  possible  thermal  expansion  of  the rock  matrix  and  further  increasing  of  temperature  may   cause  it to  weaken  by  inducing  thermal  cracks.  this  was  conﬁrmed  by the  micro-structural  analysis,  which  did  not  reveal  any  noticeable  amount  of  thermally-induced  micro-cracking  in  strathbogie granite  up  to  200 ◦c,  and  heating  of  the  granite  to  a  greater  temperature  as  400 ◦c  caused  many  intra-granular  cracks  in  quartz and  feldspar  and  some  grain  boundary  cracks  between  quartz  and feldspar  minerals.  furthermore,  according  to  ae  analysis,  increasing  the  temperature  ﬁrst  causes  the  crack  propagation  stress threshold  to  increase  and  further  increasing  of  the  temperature causes  it  to  be  slightly  reduced.  this  indicates  a  suppression  of micro-cracks  at  low  temperatures  by  matrix  expansion  and  the development  of  micro-cracks  through  thermally-induced  damage  at  higher  temperatures.   finally  an  attempt  was  made  to  improve  the  conventional  mohrcoulomb  failure  criteria  for  geothermal  reservoirs  with  extreme pressures  and  temperatures,  because  the  conventional  criteria are  not  applicable  to  extreme  conditions.  acknowledgements  this  research  project  is  funded  by

realistic  geothermal  reservoir  behaviour.  3.6.  temperature-dependent  failure  criteria  for  strathbogie granite  ≤   (3)  −   is  questionable,  due  to  the   to  date,  although  many  strength  criteria  are  available  for  intact rock,  the  practical  application  of  most  of  them  for  geothermal reservoirs  in-situ  model  parameters  required  when  considering  the  available  high-pressure  and high-temperature  environment  in  underground  reservoirs.  of  the various  failure  criteria,  the  mohr-coulomb  failure  criteria  have been  extensively  used  in  the  ﬁeld  and  have  made  a  signiﬁcant  contribution  to  the  determination  of  rock  mass  failure.  however,  they have  some  major  limitations,  including  ignoring  the  intermediate stress  (cid:2)2 inﬂuence  (which  has  been  proven  to  have  a  substantial inﬂuence  on  rock  strength)  and  the  assumed  linearity  (the  strength criteria  of  rock  are  non-linear  in  reality).  after  re-analyzing  thousands  of  reported  triaxial  experiments  and  combining  the  critical state  concept  proposed  by  barton  (1976),  singh  et  al.  (2011)  proposed  a  non-linear  mohr-coulomb  failure  criterion.  according  to the  ﬁndings  of  singh  et  al.  (2011),  the  mohr-coulomb  shear  strength parameters  should  only  be  obtained  by  performing  conventional tri-axial  tests  under  low  conﬁning  stresses  (in  the  linear  region  of the  mohr-coulomb  failure  envelope).  according  to  their  statistical analysis,  (cid:2)cc ≈   (cid:2)crit,  where  (cid:2)c and  (cid:2) crit are  uni-axial  compressive strength  and  critical  conﬁning  pressure,  respectively.  the  modiﬁed mohr-coulomb  failure  criterion  proposed  by  singh  et  al.  is  given below: (cid:2)1 −   (cid:2)3 = where,  (cid:2)ci ≈    (cid:2)ci + 2sin(cid:3)i0 sin(cid:3)i0   ucs  of  the  rock  =  2ciocos(cid:3)i0/1   sin(cid:3)i0,  (cid:3)i0 and cio are  friction  angle  and  cohesion  obtained  at  low  conﬁning  pressures.  sin(cid:3)i0) (cid:2)32  2sin(cid:3)i0  (cid:2)3 ≤  (cid:2)3 −  (cid:2)crit (1   for  0     (cid:2)crit  −   −   1     however,  even  the  improved  mohr-coulomb  failure  criteria cannot  be  directly  applied  to  geothermal  reservoir  rocks  at  extreme pressures  and  temperatures,  because  the  strength  response  is altered  by  the  thermal  effect  (heuze,  1983).  to  date,  no  extensive study  has  captured  this  thermal  response  in  the  improved  mohrcoulomb  failure  criteria.  such  a  realistic  approach  is  necessary for  deep  underground  engineering  applications  like  geothermal energy  extraction.  the  concepts  of  barton  (1976)  and  singh  et  al. (2011)  are  therefore  incorporated  into  the  temperature  inﬂuence in  this  study  and  an  attempt  is  made  to  propose  novel  strength  criteria  for  geothermal  reservoir  rocks  based  on  experimental  data:  + 2sin(cid:3)i (t)  sin(cid:3)i (t) (cid:2)3 −  −    1     −      (cid:2)3 (t) = 2ci (t) cos(cid:3)i (t) sin(cid:3)i (t)  1     (cid:2)1 −  (4)  (cid:2)3 ≤    (cid:2)crit  ≤

temperature-dependent friction  angle,  cohesion  and  critical  conﬁning  pressure  and  can  be given  as  follows: f1 (t) =  1.034  (cid:3)i (t) (cid:3)io ci (t) cio ccrit (t)  f2 (t) =  0.7795   0.0001t 2 +  10−8t 3(6)  10−5t 2 −  0.1504t   10−8t 3  0.0032t     2.22     7.62   (5)  3.53   =   +   ×   −   =   +     1.7887   0.0226t   +     f3 (t) = =  ucs  however,  it  should  be  noticed  that  the  modiﬁed  temperaturedependent  criteria  may   only  be  applicable  for  similar  types  of granites  under  the  tested  experimental  conditions.  58   w.g.p.  kumari  et  al.  /

 dwivedi  et  al.,  2008).  however,  such  alterations  are also  affected  by  the  conﬁnement  applying  on  the  rock  mass,  and conﬁning  pressure  causes  the  suppression  of  thermal  cracks  and the  extension/widening  of  existing  micro-cracks.  this  results  in further  alteration  of  the  rock  mass  mechanical  properties,  resulting  in  changing  failure  modes  (mogi,  1966).  studies  have  identiﬁed the  transition  of  rock  failure  mode  from  brittle  to  ductile  with increasing  conﬁnement.  however,  this  transition  is  diverse  due  to the  different  mineralogical  compositions  and  grain  boundaries  in different  rocks  (klein  et  al.,  2001;  wong,  1982).  although  many  studies  have  been  conducted  to  investigate  the temperature-dependent  mechanical  behaviour  of  reservoir  rocks, most  experiments  have  been  conducted  in  unconﬁned  environments  (singh  et  al.,  2015;  shao  et  al.,  2014).  pre-heating  the specimens  to  the  corresponding  temperature  ranges  and  testing  at  room  temperatures  has  been  frequently  done  (bauer  and johnson,  1979;  xu  et  al.,  2008),  but  the  method  is  not  reliable, as  geothermal  reservoirs  experience  continuous  thermal  stresses. such  limitations  have  occurred  mainly  due  to  the  limited  number  of appropriate  test  facilities  available  to  simulate  the  stress  and  temperature  conditions  of  actual  geothermal  reservoirs.  although  some studies  have  analytically  and  numerically  evaluated  the  mechanical properties  of  rocks  under  high  temperatures  and  pressures  (chester and  higgs,  1992;  tian  et  al.,  2013;  vásárhelyi  et  al.,  2016),  to  date none  has  captured  the  stress-strain  behaviour  and  failure  criteria  of rocks  over  a  wide  range  of  conﬁning  pressures  and  temperatures, particularly  for  australian  granite.  however,  the  thermo-elastic response  and  appropriate  failure  criteria  are  essential  inputs  for many  engineering  applications  under  high  pressures  and  temperatures,  including  geothermal  extraction  applications.  this  study therefore  intends  to  ﬁll  this  gap,  and  it  is  hoped  it  will  make  an important  contribution  to  many  deep  underground  applications.  2.  methodology  2.1.  tested  material  granite  is  an  abundant  crystalline  rock  in  the  earth  with  medium to  coarse  grains  which  was  formed  as  a  result  of  the  slow  cooling of  magma.  granite  therefore  has  abundant  radioactive  elements (k,  th,  and  u).  such  elements  bring  elevated  geothermal  gradients to  deep  granite  reservoirs,  which  therefore  have  ideal  conditions as  geothermal  reservoirs.  the  mineralogical  composition  of  granite  mainly  consists  of  quartz,  feldspar,  plagioclase  and  biotite,  and small  amounts  of  muscovite,  amphibole,  hornblende  and  opaque (dwivedi  et  al.,  2008).  for  the  present  study,  samples  were  collected  from  the  strathbogie  batholith,  which  is  a  composite  granitoid  intrusion  body spreading  over  more  than  1500  km2 in  150  km  north-east  from melbourne  (fig.  1).  strathbogie  granite  is  a  high-level,  discordant  fig.  1.  sampling  location  of  strathbogie  batholith  in  central  victoria.  table  1 physical,  mechanical  and  petrographic  properties  of  strathbogie  granite  (obtained under  room  temperature  and  atmospheric  pressure  conditions).  rock  type   granite  colour  average  grain  size  petrographic  description   bulk  density  (kg/m3) compressive  strength  (mpa)  elastic  modulus  (gpa)  porosity  (%)   \\u242em  white  with  dark  brown 70–600  mainly  consists  of  feldspar,  biotite, quartz  and  plagioclase  equigranular, coarse  grained,  s-type  granite 2703.4 118.17 9.09 1.16  table  2 results  of  xrd  analysis.  mineral  id   alpha  quartz sodic  and  intermediate  plagioclase  biotite—phlogopite  k-feldspar  clinochlore  muscovite—sericite dolomite—ankerite  other  minerals   mass%  50 16 15 13 2 2 1 1  granite  that  mainly  consists  of  quartz,  k-feldspar,  cordierite  and biotite  (phillips  et  al.,  1981).  the  selected  granite  type  is  coarsegrained  and  white  and  dark  brown  in  colour  with  around  1.16% porosity.  fig.  2  presents  a  close-up  view  of  a  typical  strathbogie granite  sample,  an  optical  microscopic  image  and  an  sem  image of  its  thin  section.  as  can  be  seen  in  fig.  2(b),  clear  mineralogical assembling  can  be  observed  in  the  granite  specimen,  mainly  with quartz,  k-feldspar  and  plagioclase.  as  shown  in  fig.  3,  the  grain  size was  measured  from  a  thin  section  of  this  granite  and  found  to  be \\u242em  with  only  a  small  number mainly  in  the  range  of  0  mm–200  of  larger  grains  (>300  mm)   (shao  et  al.,  2014).  table  1  summarizes the  physical,  mechanical  and  petrographic  properties  of  the  tested strathbogie  granite.  in  addition,  an  xrd  analysis  was  conducted  to determine  the  mineralogical  composition  of  the  selected  granite and  the  result  is  shown  in  table  2.  as  the  table  shows,  quartz  is the  predominant  mineral  in  the  selected  granite  (50%),  followed  by 16%  of  sodic  and  intermediate  biotite  and  15%  of  plagioclase.  the mineralogical  composition  of  this  particular  granitic  composition is  representative  of  the  composition  of  the  majority  of  the  earth’s granites  (best,  1995).  all  the  physical  properties  in  tables  1  and  2  \\x0c46   w.g.p.  kumari  et  al.  /  geothermics  65  (2017)  44–59  fig.  2.

compressive  testing  (astm  d7012-10  (2010)).  in  order  to  maintain consistency,  all  the  samples  were  cored  to  22.5  mm  in  diameter using  the  same  block  of  granite  at  the  same

and  visible  cracks  were  discarded.  it  should be  noted  that  coring-induced  rock-microstructure  alteration  is  an important  aspect  to  consider  in  laboratory  experiments,  although few  studies  have  considered  this  effect.  to  avoid  such  issues,  a  very small  coring  rate  was  adopted  and  water  was  used  as  a  lubricant. the  cored  specimens  were  then  cut  into  45  mm  high  cylinders  and both  ends  of  the  specimens  were  ground  to  produce  two  parallel surfaces  perpendicular  to  the  axes  of  the  cylindrical  specimens.  2.3.  experimental  procedure  tri-axial  experiments  were  conducted  on  samples  under  four different  conﬁning  pressures  (10,  30,  60  and  90  mpa)  and  four different  temperatures  (rt,  100,  200,  300 ◦c).  these  experimental  conditions  were  selected,  because  the  most  preferable  hot  dry rock  systems  are  generally  located  at  depths  of  2.5–3.5  km  and have  around  70  mpa–120  mpa   conﬁning  pressures  (assuming  the reservoir  rock  density  is  equal  to  2500  kg/m3)  and  temperatures  of  200–350 ◦c  (breede  et  al.,  2013).  the  different  conﬁning  pressures and  temperatures  were  selected  to  simulate  the  reservoir  depth effect  and  to  obtain  a  sufﬁcient  data  set  to  understand  the  failure criteria  under  different  temperatures.  the  complete  arrangement  of  the  tri-axial  cell  is  shown  in fig.  3.  the  prepared  sample  was  ﬁrst  placed  inside  the  cell  and  the required  conﬁning  pressure  was   then  applied  using  a  silicon  oil  system,  and  an  annealed  copper  sleeve  was  used  to  isolate  the  sample from  the  conﬁning  liquid  (refer  to  fig.  3(b).  a  mica-insulated  metal band  heater  was   used  to  heat  the  pressure  cell  and  consequently the  rock  sample.  the  temperatures  of  the  cell  were  adjusted  using  a controller  and  a  constant  small  heating  rate  of  2.5 ◦c/min  was  used to  prevent  micro-structural  damage  due  to  sudden  thermal  shocks. two  separate  thermocouples  were  used  to  achieve  precise  temperature  control,  and  the  reading  of  the  thermocouple  installed  inside the  cell  (fig.  3(b))  was   recorded  by  the  data  acquisition  system.  the other  thermocouple  that  was   attached  to  the  barrel  (fig.  3(a))  was used  to  control  the  band  heater.  furthermore,  the  barrel  and  the top  of  the  pressure  cell  were  covered  using  an  insulating  blanket to  reduce  heat  loss  during  the  experiments  and  to  minimise  the inﬂuence  of  air  ﬂows  towards  the  cell.  all  the  tests  were  started once  the  system  had  achieved  a  steady  state  to  ensure  uniformity in  temperature  and  pressure  across  the  sample.  equilibrium  was ensured  by  monitoring  the  conﬁnement  pump  volume  and  the thermocouple  readings  inside  the  cell  (located  very  close  to  the specimen).  under  steady-state  conditions,  constant  pump  volume and  constant  temperature  were  observed  and  testing  was   initiated. a   constant  loading  pump  ﬂow  rate  of  1  ml/min  was  adopted  for all  the  test  specimens  and  the  converted  displacement  rate  was 0.05  mm/min.  it  should  be  noted  that  a  small  shaft  resistance  exists as  a  result  of  the  sealing  of  the  hydraulic  cylinder,  and  this  effect was  considered  in  the  calibration  of  the  loading  cell.  the  sealing resistance  was  obtained  by  measuring  the  pump  pressure  to  initiate  a  movement  in  the  loading  shaft,  and  this  was   deducted  from each  pressure  reading  to  eliminate  the  resistance  of  the  sealing  dur\\x0cw.g.p.  kumari  et  al.  /  geothermics  65  (2017)  44–59   47  using  the  typical  mohr-coulomb  brittle  deformation.  the  deviatoric stress-strain  plots  of  the  granite  samples  (fig.  4)  exhibited  concave upward  curvilinear  trends  from  initial  loading  to  the  peak  value, beyond  which  strain  softening  occurred,  causing  a  rapid  stress  drop to  a  residual  value.  increasing  peak  stress  with  increasing  conﬁning  pressure  can  be  observed,  which  is  to  be  expected,  according to  typical  mohr-coulomb  type  brittle  failure  (paterson  and  wong, 2005).  traditionally,  rock  failure  in  compression  can  occur  in  two main  ways;  (a)  dilatancy  and  failure  by  strain  softening  under relatively  low  conﬁning  pressures  and  (b)  failure  by  strain  hardening  under  elevated  conﬁning  pressures,  and  a  transitional  regime may   be  observed  at  intermediate  pressures.  these  transitional  failure  modes  have  been  referred  to  as  “quasi-brittle”,  and  complex localized  features  such  as  conjugate  shear  bands  can  be  observed under  such  conditions  (klein  et  al.,  2001;  gajo  et  al.,  2004).  by visual  inspection  of  the  post-failure  samples,  important  information  about  the  alteration  of  the  granite  failure  mechanism  with conﬁning  pressures  and  temperatures  can  be  identiﬁed.  postfailure  images  (fig.  5)  were  therefore  collected  after  each  test.  according  to  the  post-failure  images,  specimens  that  failed at  10–60  mpa   conﬁning  pressures  mainly  failed  by  shear  localization  along  an  inclined  macroscopic  shear  band  with  a  single shear  zone  across  each  sample.  however,  samples  tested  at  higher conﬁnements  of  90  mpa   and  120  mpa   (at  100 ◦c)  exhibited  strain hardening  characteristics  after  achieving  the  peak  stress,  and  several  conjugate  shear  bands  could  be  observed  on  the  cylindrical sample  surface,  instead  of  the  single  shear  band  observed  earlier. this  characteristic  was  signiﬁcant  at  120  mpa   conﬁning  pressure. however,  it  should  be  noted  that  only  one  test  was   conducted at  120  mpa   conﬁnement,  because  at  such  high  conﬁning  pressures  the  corresponding  failure  load  of  granite  exceeds  the  bottom pedestal’s  load-bearing  capacity.  further,  a  progressive  reduction was  observed  in  the  failure  plane  angle  with  respect  to  the  minor principal  stress  direction  with  increasing  conﬁning  pressure,  which implies  a  reduction  in  friction  angle,  possibly  due  to  the  greater quasi-brittle  behaviour  that  was   shown  by  granite  samples  at higher  conﬁning  pressures  (wong  et  al.,  2001).  3.2.  effect  of  temperature  and  conﬁning  pressure  on  mechanical properties  of  strathbogie  granite  fig.  6  illustrates  the  inﬂuence  of  temperature  on  the  deviatoric stress  of  the  tested  granite  under  each  conﬁnement.  as  the  ﬁgure  shows,  the  inﬂuence  of  conﬁnement  is  more  signiﬁcant  than that  of  temperature  in  the  temperature  range  considered  here. wong  and  brace  (1979)  conﬁrm  that  at  lower  conﬁning  pressures considerable  thermal  cracking  occurs  at  relatively  low  temperatures.  if  thermal  cracking  is  responsible  for  the  reduction  in  failure strength,  a  sharp  reduction  in  deviatoric  stress  with  increasing temperature  (with  suppression  of  thermal  cracks)  should  be  exhibited  under  unconﬁned  pressure  condition.  however,  based  on  the experimental  results,  under  unconﬁned  conditions,  up  to  100 ◦c, 17.6%  of  increment  in  deviatoric  stress  is  followed  by  2.5%  and 10.5%  reductions  at  200 ◦c  and  300 ◦c,  respectively.  however,  when conﬁnement  was  applied,  strength  reduction  was  initiated  after   higher  temperature  of  200 ◦c,  mainly  due  to  the  inhibition  of a thermal  cracks  by  induced  compressive  force.  thermal  cracking  is therefore  an  important  strength  property  alteration  mechanism  in reservoir  rocks  under  certain  conﬁning  pressure  conditions.  a    clear  inﬂuence  of  temperature  on  deviatoric  stress  at  any depth  or  conﬁnement  can  be  observed,  and  increasing  the  temperature  from  room  temperature  to  200 ◦c  causes  an  increment  in deviatoric  stress,  and  further  increasing  of  temperature  to  300 ◦c causes  a  slight  reduction  in  it.  this  is  because  the  thermal  expansion which  occurs  with  increasing  temperature  causes  the  reduction  of  fig.  3.

resistance  is  negligible  which  is  only  0.19% of  maximum  measurement.  during  the  load  application,  the  axial strain  was  measured  using  linear  variable  differential  transducers (lvdts)  attached  to  the  ram  of  the  load  cell  (fig.  3(a)).  an  acoustic  emission  (ae)  system  was  also  employed  in  the  testing  of  samples  to  record  the  data  related  to  the  fracturing  process. the  ae  system  adopted  was  a  peripheral  component  interconnection  (pci)  system  with  a  nominal  resolution  frequency  of  500  khz. during  the  experiments,  two  sensors  were  attached  to  either  side  of the  loading  shaft  and  with  the  external  ampliﬁers,  which  generated low  frequency  acoustic  waves  with  the  fracturing  of  the  sample.  in addition,  possible  micro-structural  and  mineralogical  changes  that occurred  during  thermal  and  conﬁnement  effects  were  checked using  sem  analyses.  3.  results  and  discussion  3.1.

pressure.  the  reductions  of  strength  characteristics  were relatively  small  up  to  500 ◦c  and  beyond  that  an  accelerated  downward  trend  was  identiﬁed.  furthermore,  wider  localized  zones were  observed  at  high  temperatures  in  the  post-failure  images. however,  these  studies  were  conducted  at  wider  temperature ranges  (up  to  700 ◦c  and  900 ◦c,  respectively)  and  the  researchers therefore  did  not  pay  close  attention  to  reservoir  rock  behaviour under  relatively  low  geothermal  temperature  ranges  (<300 ◦c).  this was  the  focus  of  the  present  study,  according  to  which  there  is an  initial  strengthening  and  stiffening  in  granite  with  increasing temperature  at  low  temperatures  (up  to  200 ◦c),  and  increasing the  temperature  beyond  a  certain  value  causes  a  gradual  reduction  in  failure  stress  with  increasing  temperature.  elastic  modulus is  an  important  mechanical  property  of  any  reservoir  rock,  and  describes  the  brittle  characteristics  of  the  rock  mass.  it  is  therefore often  used  to  evaluate  many  in-situ  stress  applications,  including wellbore  stability,  fracturing  possibility  and  tectonic  stress  distribution  (heard  and  page,  1982).  the  temperature-dependent  brittle properties  (elastic  modulus)  of  the  tested  granite  were  then  evaluated.  the  elastic  region  of  each  stress-strain  curve  was  used  to calculate  the  temperature and  pressure-dependent  young’s  moduli  (e)  and  the  results  are  shown  in  fig.  7.  the  axial  strain  was measured  using  lvdts  attached  to  the  loading  ram  with  a  linearity ±0.1%  f.s  (full  scale)  (±0.0075  mm)   and  inﬁnite  resoluerror  of  tion  (no  hysteresis).  an  increment  of  the  modulus  of  strathbogie granite  with  increasing  temperature  up  to  200 ◦c  can  be  observed, and  further  increase  of  temperature  (to  300 ◦c)  causes  the  elastic modulus  to  be  slightly  reduced  for  any  conﬁnement.  this  trend  is  \\x0ca  ‘brittle’  or     general  increment  in  elastic  modulus  with  increasing  conﬁnement  can  be  observed  until  90  mpa,  and  a  further  increase of  conﬁnement  (to  120  mpa)  reduces  the  young’s  modulus  considerably.  with  increasing  conﬁning  stress  additional  plastic deformation  occurs,  exhibiting  strain-hardening  characteristics  in granite  under  high  conﬁnements.  however,  within  the  range  of the  experiments  conducted  (10  mpa–120  mpa)  it  cannot  be  deﬁnitively  identiﬁed  as  a  ’ductile’  regime.  however,  the strain-hardening  behaviour  observed  at  120  mpa   indicates  transitional  characteristics  and  this  can  be  identiﬁed  as  ‘quasi-brittle’ behaviour  (klein  et  al.,  2001).  the  initial  young’s  modulus  reduction  with  increasing  conﬁnement  was  observed  by  heard  and  page (1982),  who   conducted  tests  up  to  55  mpa   conﬁning  pressure.  however,  the  latter  behaviour  was  not  observed  by  these  researchers. interestingly,  according  to  the  research  literature,  at  low  temperatures  (<200 ◦c)  some  granite  types  are  more  temperature-sensitive, while  in  contrast,  some  granites  are  more  temperature-sensitive at  high  temperatures.  the  initial  strength  enhancement  is  more signiﬁcant  for  coarse-grained  granites  and  granodiorite  than  for ﬁne-grained  granites.  for  example,  according  to  heard  and  page (1982),  stripa  granite  is  more  sensitive  to  temperature  at  relatively  low  temperatures  (<200 ◦c),  and  westerly  granite  is  more sensitive  to  temperature  at  high  temperatures  (>200 ◦c).  such  contradictory  behaviours  may   occur  in  granite  due  to  the  different grain  size  distributions,  grain  orientations,  mineralogical  compositions  and  heterogeneity  of  different  granite  types.  this  indicates  the importance  of  studying  the  mineralogical  composition  and  microstructural  inﬂuence  of  granites  on  such  on  temperature-dependent strength  variations.  3.3.  effect  of  temperature  on  shear  strength  parameters  of strathbogie  granite  fig.  8  illustrates  the  variation  of  deviatoric  stress  of  the  tested granite  with  conﬁning  pressure  for  each  temperature.  the  ﬁgure shows  that  increasing  conﬁnement  causes  the  granite’s  deviatoric stress  to  increase  non-linearly  and  gradually  come  to  a  steady  state. this  is  consistent  with  similar  previous  studies,  which  have  clearly shown  the  enhancement  of  rock  strength  with  increasing  conﬁnement,  and  the  increasing  rate  is  reduced  with  increasing  conﬁning pressure  (barton,  2013;  singh  et  al.,  2011).  this  is  because  at  low conﬁning  pressures  there  is  a  high  dilation  potential.  therefore,  the ability  to  open  rock  micro-cracks  is  high,  resulting  in  higher  friction  angles.  however,  this  dilation  potential  and  the  corresponding tendency  for  micro-cracks  to  open  are  suppressed  with  increasing conﬁnement,  resulting  in  lower  friction  angles  at  higher  conﬁning  pressures.  therefore,  the  failure  mechanism  of  the  rocks  shifts from  brittle  to  ductile  with  increasing  conﬁnement,  changing  the shape  of  the  mohr-coulomb  failure  envelope,  and  according  to barton  (1976),  at  critical  conﬁning  pressure  the  mohr-coulomb  failure  envelope  reaches  a  zero  gradient.  this  has  also  been  shown by  hoek  (1983).  the  present  study  has  clearly  identiﬁed  this  rock behaviour  in  the  mohr-coulomb  failure  envelopes  developed  for each  temperature  condition  (refer  to  fig.  9).  according  to  fig.  9, the  traditional  linear  mohr-coulomb  criteria  are  applicable  only  in the  brittle  region  of  the  failure  envelope,  and  at  higher  conﬁnew.g.p.  kumari  et  al.  /  geothermics  65  (2017)  44–59  consistent  with  the  temperature-dependent  strength  behaviour  of the  granite  described  above.  the  reason  for  the  initial  elastic  module  increment  may  be  that  the  specimen  becomes  more  brittle  at the  initial  temperature  ranges  due  to  thermally-induced  volumetric  expansion  and  the  associated  pore  volume  reduction.  the  later slight  reduction  of  young’s  modulus  with  increasing  temperature exhibits  an  enhancement  in  ductile  behaviour  (quasi-brittle  characteristics)  with  further  increase  of  temperature.  this  is  possibly due  to  the  increased  crack  density  caused  by  the  induced  thermal crack  development  and  the  related  weakening  of  the  granite.  600  500

different thermo-elastic  moduli  and  this  may   causes  to  generate  different  internal  stresses  with  heating).  according  to  wong  and  brace (1979),  increasing  the  temperature  causes  the  induction  of  thermal cracks  in  the  rock  mass  due  to  the  associated  generation  of  internal stresses  (eq.

(2)) exceeds  the  crack  closure  pressure  with  increasing  temperature, thermal  cracks  form  and  further  increase  of  temperature  provides the  surface  energy  required  for  the  propagation  of  the  initiated crack  (zuo  et  al.,  2007).  this  results  in  alteration  of  the  grain-tograin  contacts  in  the  rock  matrix,  which  leads  to  reduced  cohesion at  higher  temperatures.  in  the  case  of  the  variation  of  friction  angle with  increasing  temperature,  the  granite  friction  angle  appears  to remain  steady  up  to  around  100 ◦c  (52◦)  and  then  slightly  increases with  increasing  temperature  (54◦ at  200  and  300 ◦ c,  respectively). the  friction  between  grain-to-grain  contacts  may  be  altered  by the  thermally-induced  micro-structural  modiﬁcations.  however, this  effect  on  grain  contact  is  expected  to  be  smaller  at  relatively low  temperatures,  resulting  in  relatively  steady  friction  angle  with increasing  temperature  at  lower  temperatures.  however,  a  slight  ments  non-linearity  must  be  taken  into  account.  in  addition  to  the conﬁnement,  according  to  this  study,  increasing  temperature  also alters  the  failure  envelope  of  granite.  an  initial  increment  in  deviatoric  stress  with  increasing  temperature  can  be  observed  up  to 200 ◦c  and  further  increase  of  temperature  (to  300 ◦c)  causes  it  to be  slightly  reduced.  the  temperature-dependent  shear  parameters  of  granite  were investigated  next,  and  the  shear  parameters  can  be  obtained from  the  mohr-coulomb  failure  envelope.  as  suggested  by  singh et  al.  (2011),  the  mohr-coulomb  parameters  (cohesion  and  friction  angle)  were  calculated  using  eq.  (1),  taking  into  account  the linear  region  of  the  obtained  mohr-coulomb  failure  envelope  (considering  only  smaller  conﬁning  stresses,  up  to  30  mpa)  for  each temperature  condition  to  obtain  the  temperature-dependent  shear strength  parameters  (fig.  10).  (1)  sin(cid:3) sin(cid:3) (cid:2)3  +   −   + 1  1     −   (cid:2)1 = 2ccos(cid:3) sin(cid:3)i  1     \\u24341,   \\u24343 are  major  principal  stress  and  minor  principal  stress,  where,  and  c  and  (cid:3)  are  cohesion  and  friction  angle,  respectively. according  to  fig.  10,  cohesion  increases  from  20.7  to  25.7  mpa with  increasing  temperature  from  room  temperature  to  100 ◦c  and further  increases  of  temperature  up  to  200 ◦c  and  300 ◦c  cause  the granite  cohesion  to  be  reduced  to  24.8  mpa   and  23.2  mpa,  respectively.  the  observed  cohesion  gain  at  relatively  low  temperatures conﬁrms  that  thermally-induced  rock  matrix  expansion  induces  a greater  mutual  attraction  among  individual  minerals.  this  is  also inﬂuenced  by  the  inhibition  of  micro-crack  propagation  at  relatively  low  temperatures  (duclos  and  paquet,  1991).  in  relation  to  \\x0c52   w.g.p.  kumari  et  al.  /  geothermics  65  (2017)  44–59  fig.  11.  cumulative  ae  events  vs.  axial  stress  at  different  pressures  and  temperatures.  \\x0cw.g.p.  kumari  et  al.  /  geothermics  65  (2017)  44–59   53  fig.  11.  (continued)  enhancement  in  friction  angle  with  increasing  temperature  can  be seen,  probably  due  to  the  increased  resistance  of  mineral  particles to  external  deformation  as  a  result  of  the  thermally-induced  energy in  the  mineral  particles.  however,  compared  with  cohesion,  the temperature  dependency  on  friction  angle  is  relatively  insigniﬁcant within  the  temperature  region  considered  here.  initial  enhancement  in  shear  parameters  in  sandstone  with increasing  temperature  has  been  observed  by  zhang  et  al.  (2015)  at relatively  low  temperature  regions,  and  these  researchers  observed   reduction  in  friction  angle  from  33.02◦ to  31.93◦ and  an  increment a in  cohesion  from  61.47  mpa   to  66.44  mpa   with  increasing  temperature  from  25 ◦c  to  100 ◦c.  further,  bauer  and  johnson  (1979) observed  around  10%  reduction  in  cohesion  and  40%  reduction  in friction  angle  in  westerly  granite  with  increasing  temperature  from room  temperature  to  300 ◦c,  and  friedman  et  al.  (1979)  observed   7%  reduction  in  cohesion  and  a  38%  reduction  in  friction  angle a with  increasing  temperature  from  room  temperature  to  400 ◦c and  300 ◦c,  respectively.  however,  the  variation  of  shear  strength parameters  with  increasing  temperature  at  relatively  low  temperatures  (<300 ◦c)  was  not  considered  in  the  above  studies.  the observed  initial  shear  strengthening  may   be  due  to  the  inhibition  of micro-crack  propagation  by  the  plasticity  mechanism  which  occurs at  crack  tips  (duclos  and  paquet  (1991))  at  low  temperatures.  with further  increment  of  temperature,  the  reduction  of  shear  strength parameters  can  be  expected,  due  to  the  thermal  weakening  of  the rock  micro-structure.  furthermore,  according  to  the  sem  studies conducted  by  zuo  et  al.  (2007),  large  local  plastic  deformations  and extremely  rough  cleavage  fractures  occur  at  relatively  low  temperatures.  moreover,  due  to  the  volume  expansion,  the  distance between  the  interfaces  of  the  individual  minerals  decreases  with the  enhancement  of  their  mutual  attraction,  and  the  strength  of the  bonds  increases  (dmitriev,  1972).  both  of  these  phenomena  can  be  considered  to  explain  the  stress  strengthening  of  granite  under relatively  low  temperatures  when  subjected  to  conﬁning  pressures.  3.4.  analysis  of  fracturing  behaviour  using  ae  technology  acoustic  emission  (ae)  detection  technology  is  a  powerful  nondestructive  tool  to  study  crack  propagation  processes  in  brittle materials,  including  the  stages  of  crack  initiation,  growth  and  crack damage  (lockner,  1993).  when  a  brittle  material  is  under  stress, strain  energy  is  released  during  the  development  of  new  cracks  or the  widening  of  existing  cracks.  this  energy  is  released  in  the  form of  elastic  stress  waves  from  the  crack  tips,  and  can  be  captured  and ampliﬁed  by  an  ae  system.  ae  detection  technology  has  therefore been  widely  used  in  a  number  of  previous  studies  to  understand the  crack  development  mechanism  in  brittle  materials  (chang  and lee,  2004;  lei  et  al.,  2000;  moura  et  al.,  2005).  by  incorporating  the  crack  propagation  pattern  into  the  stressstrain  relationship  of  the  cracking  material,  the  crack  development process  can  be  divided  into  several  stages.  hoek  and  bieniawski (1965)  divided  crack  formation  into  ﬁve  main  stages:  crack  closure,  crack  initiation,  secondary  cracking,  crack  coalescence  and crack  damage.  later,  ranjith  et  al.  (2008)  and  shao  et  al.  (2015) incorporated  stress-strain  curves  into  cumulative  ae  counts/energy and  strain  plots.  in  the  crack  propagation  process,  with  the  gradual increment  of  loading  on  brittle  materials,  most  pre-existing  cracks are  ﬁrst  closed,  releasing  an  insigniﬁcant  number  of  ae  counts. this  initial  crack  closure  period  is  followed  by  the  stable  crack propagation  period,  which  can  be  identiﬁed  by  the  release  of  gradual  ae  energy  increments.  further  increment  of  loading  causes  an exponential  increase  in  ae  energy,  indicating  an  unstable  crack propagation  period  with  failure  approaching.  the  crack  closure threshold  ((cid:2)cc)  is  deﬁned  as  the  stress  threshold  at  which  the  initial ae  counts  are  identiﬁed.  anan  initial  increment  in  cumulative  ae  \\x0c54   w.g.p.  kumari  et  al.  /  geothermics  65  (2017)  44–59  counts  can  be  seen  at  the  crack  initiation  ((cid:2)ci)  threshold,  and  the cumulative  ae  counts  starts  exponential  growth  at  the  crack  damage  ((cid:2)cd)  threshold.  the  region  between  the  crack  closure  threshold and  the  crack  initiation  threshold  is  generally  deﬁned  as  the  stable crack  closure  region,  where  linear  elastic  deformation  occurs.  the region  between  the  crack  initiation  threshold  and  the  crack  damage  threshold  is  deﬁned  as  the  stable  crack  propagation  region,  and the  region  between  the  crack  damage  threshold  and  sample  failure is  identiﬁed  as  the  unstable  crack  propagation  region.  the  application  of  compressive  loading  fails  rocks  through  either shear  localization  (brittle  regime)  or  cataclastic  ﬂow,  and  the  surrounding  conditions,  such  as  temperatures  and  pressures,  may cause  a  homogenous  plastic  ﬂow.  according  to  existing  studies, axial  intra-granular  cracking  and  shear  rupturing  of  cemented  grain contacts  can  be  observed  before  failure  in  brittle  regimes,  and  grain crushing  and  pore  collapse  can  be  identiﬁed  before  failure  in  cataclastic  ﬂow  regimes  (menéndez  et  al.,  1996).  according  to  wong et  al.  (1997),  the  development  of  local  stress  concentrations  leads to  the  initiation  of  many  intra-granular  micro-cracks  in  the  rock mass,  and  the  crack  density  increases  with  increasing  deviatoric stress  and  tends  to  merge  on  reaching  the  peak  stress,  resulting  in strain  softening  and  shear  localization.  these  damage  processes  are clearly  identiﬁed  by  the  intense  ae  activities  in  the  ﬁeld  (chang  and lee,  2004).  ae  technology  was  therefore  used  to  investigate  the  progressive  fracturing  behaviour  in  strathbogie  granite  under  tri-axial conditions.  fig.  11  illustrates  the  cumulative  ae  events  with  axial stress  at  various  pressures  and  temperatures  for  the  tested  specimens.  the  corresponding  variations  of  deviatoric  stress  against strain  are  also  included  in  the  same  plots  to  identify  the  stress thresholds  for  crack  closure,  crack  initiation  and  crack  damage (table  4).  the  very  high  ae  counts  in  strathbogie  granite  at  dilatancy in  the  pre-failure  stage  are  due  to  the  fact  that  ae  waves  generate when  the  local  shear  stress  concentration  at  a  grain  contact  is  sufﬁciently  high  to  rupture  the  grain  boundaries,  and  frictional  slips and  grain  rotations  may   occur  once  the  grain  contacts  have  lost their  cohesion.  in  the  present  study,  crack  threshold  ratios  were  deﬁned  to  identify  the  temperature  and  pressure-dependent  crack  propagation  in the  tested  granite  as  follows,  and  fig.  12  shows  the  crack  propagation  stress  threshold  ratios  of  granite  specimens  tested  at  various conﬁning  pressures  and  temperatures.  crack  closure  stress  threshold   = deviatoric  stress  at  crack  closure  stress   deviatoric  stress  at  failure  ((cid:2)cc)  crack  initiation  stress  threshold   = deviatoric  stress  at  crack  initiation  stress   deviatoric  stress  at  failure  ((cid:2)ci)  crack  damage  stress  threshold   = deviatoric  stress  at  crack  damage  stress  ((cid:2)cd)  deviatoric  stress  at  failure  according  to  the  results,  the  beginning  of  crack  damage  occurs at  earlier  stages  of  deviatoric  loading  for  higher  conﬁning  pressures.  however,  the  crack  damage  stress  increases  with  increasing conﬁnement  due  to  the  inﬂuence  of  conﬁning  pressure  on  thermal crack  development  and  the  suppression  of  the  extension/widening of  existing  micro-cracks.  according  to  fig.  12,  in  the  temperature  range  considered  here,  three  tendencies  can  be  identiﬁed with  increasing  conﬁning  pressure:  increase  of  the  elastic  deformation  region,  decrease  of  the  stable  crack  propagation  region,  and increase  of  the  unstable  crack  propagation  region.  the  crack  initiation  stress  threshold  also  progressively  increases  with  increasing conﬁning  pressure,  which  can  be  attributed  to  the  fact  that  the brittle  behaviour  of  rock  specimens  at  lower  conﬁning  pressures changes  to  quasi-brittle  behaviour  with  increasing  conﬁning  pressure.  this  is  because  the  suppression  of  micro-crack  development is  less  at  low  conﬁning  pressures,  and  therefore  sudden  failures  mostly  occur,  and  the  beginning  of  crack  initiation  occurs  at  earlier  stages  of  deviatoric  loading  at  high  conﬁning  pressures due  to  the  higher  normal  stress  acting  on  micro-cracks,  resulting  in  limited  progression  of  cracking  before  failure.  in  relation to  the  temperature  effect,  increasing  the  temperature  causes  an initial  increment  in  the  crack  propagation  stress  threshold,  followed  by  a  slight  reduction  for  all  the  temperature  conditions considered.  for  example,  at  30  mpa   conﬁnement,  the  crack  damage  stress  threshold  ratios  increased  by  around  6.8%,  10.5%  with increasing  temperature  from  room  temperature  to  100  and  200 ◦c, respectively,  and  reduced  by  around  4.0%  when  the  temperature increased  to  300 ◦c.  this  implies  that  at  low  temperatures  a  suppressed  micro-crack  development  mechanism  is  dominant,  and increasing  the  temperature  causes  crack  damage  to  occur  at  earlier  loading  stages.  interestingly,  at  60  mpa   conﬁnement  the  crack damage  stress  threshold  ratio  increased  by  around  4.9%,  5.4%, 2.6%  with  increasing  temperature  from  room  to  100,  200  and 300 ◦c,  respectively.  this  exhibits  the  cumulative  effect  of  temperature  and  pressure  micro-crack  development  in  the  rock  mass. at  relatively  low  temperatures,  micro-crack  propagation  may  be inhibited  by  the  thermally-induced  plasticity  mechanism  which occurs  at  crack  tips  and  the  increased  bonding  strength  through thermally-induced  rock  matrix  expansion  (which  increases  crack stress  thresholds).  however,  further  increase  of  temperature  creates  thermally-induced  cracks  and  causes  the  grain  boundary cracks  to  widen,  resulting  in  early  crack  damage.  further,  with  the inﬂuence  of  conﬁnement,  micro-crack  development  is  suppressed, causing  a  relatively  low  increment  of  crack  damage  stress  threshold ratios  at  higher  conﬁnements.  3.5.  corresponding  alterations  in  granite  micro-structure  a    comprehensive  micro-structural  analysis  was   also  performed to  identify  the  interior  correspondences  of  the  above-described temperature-dependent  mechanical  behaviour  of  granite.  sem  and optical  microscopic  analyses  were  performed  on  thin  sections of  granite  specimens  at  various  temperatures:  room  temperature  (20 ◦c),  pre-heated  (72  hours)  to  200 ◦c  and  400 ◦c  (fig.  13). these  temperatures  were  selected  to  identify  the  microstructural behaviour  at  200 ◦c,  at  which  the  highest  strength  increment  was observed,  and  400 ◦c,  at  which  clear  thermally-induced  rock  mass weakening  was  observed.  a  specimen  at  room  temperature  was used  as  a  control.  based  on  optical  microscope  imaging,  mineralogical  assembling in  the  granite  specimen  could  be  identiﬁed  by  the  colour  and  texture  of  each  of  the  mineral  assemblages.  further,  a  detailed  sem study  was   performed  using  scanning  electron  imaging  (sei)  and bsei  back-scatter  electron  imaging  (bsei)  techniques.  bsei  images taken  at  low  magniﬁcations  clearly  show  different  mineral  assemblages  and  grain  boundaries  (see  fig.  14).  using  energy-dispersive x-ray  (edx)  technology  with  aztec  oxford  instruments,  chemical  component  mapping  was  generated  in  each  specimen,  and each  mineral  was  identiﬁed  qualitatively.  the  bright  colour  images observed  in  edx  images  indicate  higher  concentration  (higher energy  dispersion)  while  dark  colour  areas  indicate  lower  concentration  (lower  energy  dispersion).  based  on  the  spectrum  of  each point  (point  id),  the  corresponding  mineral  was  identiﬁed  and  a map   spectrum  provided  overall  elements  available  for  each  specimen.  according  to  figs.  13  and  14,  there  are  clear  mineralogical assembling  in  the  granite  specimens,  mainly  with  quartz,  kfeldspar  and  plagioclase.  the  heating  of  granite  up  to  200 ◦c temperature  has  not  caused  any  signiﬁcant  thermally-induced micro-cracks  (in  addition  to  the  pre-existing  faults  and  grain boundaries)  and  almost  all  grain  boundaries  remain  intact.  however,  further  heating  of  granite  to  the  higher  temperature  of 400 ◦c  caused  the  induction  of  some  micro-cracks,  mainly  along  \\x0cw.g.p.  kumari  et  al.  /  geothermics  65  (2017)  44–59   55  table   4 stress  thresholds  for  different  fracturing  stages.  temperature

have  been  partially  parted  and  a  signiﬁcant  number of  grain  boundaries  appear  to  remain  intact  up  to  this  temperature.  furthermore,  based  on  the  edx  mapping,  it  was   conﬁrmed that  intra-granular  cracks  are  mainly  initiated  along  the  feldspar and  quartz  minerals.  intragranular  cracks  were  mainly  observed in  larger  crystals  (crystals  greater  than  0.5  mm)   and  smaller  crystals  remained  un-parted  even  at  400 ◦c.  for  strathbogie  granite, thermally-induced  intra-granular  micro-cracks  seem  to  play  a  signiﬁcant  role  at  relatively  low  temperatures,  probably  due  to  the presence  of  relatively  high  k  feldspar  and  biotite  contents.  similar  observations  have  been  reported  in  bauer  and  johnson’s  (1979) study  conducted  for  charcoal  granite,  where  intra-granular  microcracks  predominantly  occur  compared  to  grain  boundary  cracks. the  sem  analysis  is  also  consistent  with  this  ﬁnding,  which  exhibits inhibition  of  micro-crack  development  followed  by  micro-cracking at  relatively  high  temperatures.  the  crack  propagation  process  in  any  rock  mass  is  largely inﬂuenced  by  the  mineralogical  composition,  because  cracks  normally  propagate  through  weaker  planes  of  the  rock  mass.  since granite  is  an  igneous  type  of  rock,  two  main  types  of  thermallyinduced  cracking  modes  can  be  identiﬁed:  inter-granular  and  intragranular.  the  amount  of  inter-granular  or  intra-granular  cracking is  dependent  on  the  stress  state,  rock  type  and  mineralogy  of the  rock  mass.  inter-granular  cracks  occur  along  grain  boundaries, pre-existing  faults  and  micro-cracks  of  the  rock,  while  intragranular  cracks  occur  through  weaker  mineralogical  constituents (kranz,  1983).  for  example,  k feldspar  and  biotite  are  weaker  mineralogical  constituents  due  to  their  large  crystals  (>10  mm), as  crystals  greater  than  2–3  mm  in  size  are  generally  deﬁned  as weaker  mineralogical  constituents  compared  to  equi-dimensional small  crystals  like  quartz  (homand-etienne  and  houpert,  1989). based  on  experimental  results,  intra-granular  cracking  is  highly temperature-dependent  due  to  the  temperature dependent  dislocations  in  the  rocks.  this  is  because  different  mineralogical components  have  different  thermo-elastic  moduli  and  thermal conductivities  (kranz,  1983;  dwivedi  et  al.,  2008).  these  observations  suggest  that  micro-cracking  in  granite  is highly  temperature dependent,  as  evidenced  by  the  previously observed  initial  strength  gain  followed  by  slight  strength  reduction  with  increasing  temperature  in  the  tested  granite.  however, this  shows  that  granite  needs  to  be  heated  to  a  sufﬁcient  temperature  to  cause  thermal  cracks  in  it  and  therefore,  heating  to  a  lower temperature  may   only  cause  a  strength  gain  through  the  thermal expansion  of  the  rock  matrix.  this  is  consistent  with  the  results of  bauer  and  johnson  (1979).  the  mechanical  properties  of  charcoal  granite  in  their  study  remained  relatively  steady  until  200 ◦c, and  westerly  granite  exhibited  a  signiﬁcant  thermal  dependency, even  at  relatively  low  temperatures  (<200 ◦c).  in  homand-etienne and  houpert  (1989)  study,  the  variation  of  uni-axial  compressive strength  of  both  semones  and  remiremont  granites  is  insigniﬁcant until  400 ◦c,  followed  by  signiﬁcant  reductions  at  higher  temperatures.  these  results  indicate  the  dependency  of  mineralogical composition  and  grain  size  distribution  on  the  temperature dependent  mechanical  behaviour  in  various  types  of  granites.  however,  \\x0cw.g.p.  kumari  et  al.  /  geothermics  65  (2017)  44–59   57  fig.  14.  bse  images  of  strathbogie  granite  with  edx  mapping:  (a)

granite  under  four  different  conﬁning  pressures  (10,  30, 60,  90  mpa)  and  four  different  temperatures  (rt,  100,  200,  300 ◦c), simulating  various  geothermal  reservoir  conditions.  the  following conclusions  can  be  drawn:   mechanical  behaviour  of  the  tested  granite  is  inﬂuenced  by  both reservoir  depth  and  temperature,  and  the  depth  effect  is  much greater  than  the  temperature  effect.   granite  located  at  relatively  smaller  depths  appears  to  fail through  shear  localization  and  increasing  depth  may  cause  this to  change  to  ductile  failure  through  strain  hardening.  a  progressive  enhancement  in  stress  threshold  with  increasing  conﬁning pressure  is  observed  in  strathbogie  granite.  such  behaviours exhibit  greater  strength  and  lower  brittle  characteristics  in  granite  located  at  greater  depths.   increasing  of  temperature  causes  granite’s  strength  to  be enhanced  up  to  a  certain  temperature  (around  200 ◦c  for  strathbogie  granite)  through  the  possible  thermal  expansion  of  the rock  matrix  and  further  increasing  of  temperature  may   cause  it to  weaken  by  inducing  thermal  cracks.  this  was  conﬁrmed  by the  micro-structural  analysis,  which  did  not  reveal  any  noticeable  amount  of  thermally-induced  micro-cracking  in  strathbogie granite  up  to  200 ◦c,  and  heating  of  the  granite  to  a  greater  temperature  as  400 ◦c  caused  many  intra-granular  cracks  in  quartz and  feldspar  and  some  grain  boundary  cracks  between  quartz  and feldspar  minerals.  furthermore,  according  to  ae  analysis,  increasing  the  temperature  ﬁrst  causes  the  crack  propagation  stress threshold  to  increase  and  further  increasing  of  the  temperature causes  it  to  be  slightly  reduced.  this  indicates  a  suppression  of micro-cracks  at  low  temperatures  by  matrix  expansion  and  the development  of  micro-cracks  through  thermally-induced  damage  at  higher  temperatures.   finally  an  attempt  was  made  to  improve  the  conventional  mohrcoulomb  failure  criteria  for  geothermal  reservoirs  with  extreme pressures  and  temperatures,  because  the  conventional  criteria are  not  applicable  to  extreme  conditions.  acknowledgements  this  research  project  is  funded  by

were  conducted  on  preheated  specimens,  which  really  cannot  represent  the  real  in-situ ﬁeld  situation  in  geothermal  reservoirs.  the  present  study  may therefore  capture  more  realistic  geothermal  reservoir  behaviour.  3.6.  temperature-dependent  failure  criteria  for  strathbogie granite  ≤   (3)  −   is  questionable,  due  to  the   to  date,  although  many  strength  criteria  are  available  for  intact rock,  the  practical  application  of  most  of  them  for  geothermal reservoirs  in-situ  model  parameters  required  when  considering  the  available  high-pressure  and high-temperature  environment  in  underground  reservoirs.  of  the various  failure  criteria,  the  mohr-coulomb  failure  criteria  have been  extensively  used  in  the  ﬁeld  and  have  made  a  signiﬁcant  contribution  to  the  determination  of  rock  mass  failure.  however,  they have  some  major  limitations,  including  ignoring  the  intermediate stress  (cid:2)2 inﬂuence  (which  has  been  proven  to  have  a  substantial inﬂuence  on  rock  strength)  and  the  assumed  linearity  (the  strength criteria  of  rock  are  non-linear  in  reality).  after  re-analyzing  thousands  of  reported  triaxial  experiments  and  combining  the  critical state  concept  proposed  by  barton  (1976),  singh  et  al.  (2011)  proposed  a  non-linear  mohr-coulomb  failure  criterion.  according  to the  ﬁndings  of  singh  et  al.  (2011),  the  mohr-coulomb  shear  strength parameters  should  only  be  obtained  by  performing  conventional tri-axial  tests  under  low  conﬁning  stresses  (in  the  linear  region  of the  mohr-coulomb  failure  envelope).  according  to  their  statistical analysis,  (cid:2)cc ≈   (cid:2)crit,  where  (cid:2)c and  (cid:2) crit are  uni-axial  compressive strength  and  critical  conﬁning  pressure,  respectively.  the  modiﬁed mohr-coulomb  failure  criterion  proposed  by  singh  et  al.  is  given below: (cid:2)1 −   (cid:2)3 = where,  (cid:2)ci ≈    (cid:2)ci + 2sin(cid:3)i0 sin(cid:3)i0   ucs  of  the  rock  =  2ciocos(cid:3)i0/1   sin(cid:3)i0,  (cid:3)i0 and cio are  friction  angle  and  cohesion  obtained  at  low  conﬁning  pressures.  sin(cid:3)i0) (cid:2)32  2sin(cid:3)i0  (cid:2)3 ≤  (cid:2)3 −  (cid:2)crit (1   for  0     (cid:2)crit  −   −   1     however,  even  the  improved  mohr-coulomb  failure  criteria cannot  be  directly  applied  to  geothermal  reservoir  rocks  at  extreme pressures  and  temperatures,  because  the  strength  response  is altered  by  the  thermal  effect  (heuze,  1983).  to  date,  no  extensive study  has  captured  this  thermal  response  in  the  improved  mohrcoulomb  failure  criteria.  such  a  realistic  approach  is  necessary for  deep  underground  engineering  applications  like  geothermal energy  extraction.  the  concepts  of  barton  (1976)  and  singh  et  al. (2011)  are  therefore  incorporated  into  the  temperature  inﬂuence in  this  study  and  an  attempt  is  made  to  propose  novel  strength  criteria  for  geothermal  reservoir  rocks  based  on  experimental  data:  + 2sin(cid:3)i (t)  sin(cid:3)i (t) (cid:2)3 −  −    1     −      (cid:2)3 (t) = 2ci (t) cos(cid:3)i (t) sin(cid:3)i (t)  1     (cid:2)1 −  (4)  (cid:2)3 ≤    (cid:2)crit  ≤   sin(cid:3)i (t)) (cid:2)32 for  0   −   (cid:2)crit (t)  (1   2sin(cid:3)i (t)  (7)  10−7t 3  ×     4.52   0.0002t 2 +  −   ×   −   ×   where,  (cid:3)i (t) ,  ci (t) and  (cid:2)crit (t) are  temperature-dependent friction  angle,  cohesion  and  critical  conﬁning  pressure  and  can  be given  as  follows: f1 (t) =  1.034  (cid:3)i (t) (cid:3)io ci (t) cio ccrit (t)  f2 (t) =  0.7795   0.0001t 2 +  10−8t 3(6)  10−5t 2 −  0.1504t   10−8t 3  0.0032t     2.22     7.62   (5)  3.53   =   +   ×   −   =   +     1.7887   0.0226t   +     f3 (t) = =  ucs  however,  it  should  be  noticed  that  the  modiﬁed  temperaturedependent  criteria  may   only  be  applicable  for  similar  types  of granites  under  the  tested  experimental  conditions.  58   w.g.p.  kumari  et  al.  /

axelsson, 2010). exploratory geothermal wells have therefore been drilled to test the availability of geothermal reservoir ∗ corresponding author at: deep earth energy laboratory, department of civil engineering, monash university, building 60, melbourne, victoria 3800, australia. e-mail address: ranjith.pg@monash.edu (p.g. ranjith). http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geothermics.2016.07.002 0375-6505/© 2016 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved. rocks (rocks at elevated temperatures) and deep granite reservoirs have been found to have adequate temperatures to serve as a geothermal reservoirs (fox et al., 2013). such explorations involve ﬁnding vast blocks of “hot rocks” with fracture systems. such rocks can be used to generate electricity. in this process, water is ﬁrst injected and circulated through the fractures in the geothermal reservoirs and eventually pumped back to the surface as steam. however, the exploration of geothermal resources has become a challenge to engineers and geologists, due to the high temperature and stress environments in geothermal reservoirs. for this reason, laboratory experiments conducted under high pressure and temperature conditions (geothermal conditions) can assist in providing\\x0cw.g.p. kumari et al. / geothermics 65 (2017) 44–59 45 basic predictions. a large number of laboratory experiments has therefore been conducted since 1970 to investigate the inﬂuence of high pressure and temperature on rock in relation to geothermal heat extraction (siratovich et al., 2016), deep geological disposal of nuclear waste (paquet and franc¸ ois, 1980), deep mining (wawersik and hannum, 1980) and geological co2 storage (dai et al., 2014). the mechanical behaviour of reservoir rocks is signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by elevated temperatures, because they cause the micro-structure of the rock mass to be altered through thermal expansion, the development of new micro-cracks, extending and/or widening the existing micro cracks and various mineralogical alterations. rock strength-deformation criteria change with temperature, and some rock mechanical properties, such as compressive strength, tensile strength, elastic modulus, cohesive strength and friction angle, decrease with increasing temperature (heuze, 1983; dwivedi et al., 2008). however, such alterations are also affected by the conﬁnement applying on the rock mass, and conﬁning pressure causes the suppression of thermal cracks and the extension/widening of existing micro-cracks. this results in further alteration of the rock mass mechanical properties, resulting in changing failure modes (mogi, 1966). studies have identiﬁed the transition of rock failure mode from brittle to ductile with increasing conﬁnement. however, this transition is diverse due to the different mineralogical compositions and grain boundaries in different rocks (klein et al., 2001; wong, 1982). although many studies have been conducted to investigate the temperature-dependent mechanical behaviour of reservoir rocks, most experiments have been conducted in unconﬁned environments (singh et al., 2015; shao et al., 2014). pre-heating the specimens to the corresponding temperature ranges and testing at room temperatures has been frequently done (bauer and johnson, 1979; xu et al., 2008), but the method is not reliable, as geothermal reservoirs experience continuous thermal stresses. such limitations have occurred mainly due to the limited number of appropriate test facilities available to simulate the stress and temperature conditions of actual geothermal reservoirs. although some studies have analytically and numerically evaluated the mechanical properties of rocks under high temperatures and pressures (chester and higgs, 1992; tian et al., 2013; vásárhelyi et al., 2016), to date none has captured the stress-strain behaviour and failure criteria of rocks over a wide range of conﬁning pressures and temperatures, particularly for australian granite. however, the thermo-elastic response and appropriate failure criteria are essential inputs for many engineering applications under high pressures and temperatures, including geothermal extraction applications. this study therefore intends to ﬁll this gap, and it is hoped it will make an important contribution to many deep underground applications. 2. methodology 2.1. tested material granite is an abundant crystalline rock in the earth with medium to coarse grains which was formed as a result of the slow cooling of magma. granite therefore has abundant radioactive elements (k, th, and u). such elements bring elevated geothermal gradients to deep granite reservoirs, which therefore have ideal conditions as geothermal reservoirs. the mineralogical composition of granite mainly consists of quartz, feldspar, plagioclase and biotite, and small amounts of muscovite, amphibole, hornblende and opaque (dwivedi et al., 2008). for the present study, samples were collected from the strathbogie batholith, which is a composite granitoid intrusion body spreading over more than 1500 km2 in 150 km north-east from melbourne (fig. 1). strathbogie granite is a high-level, discordant fig. 1. sampling location of strathbogie batholith in central victoria. table 1 physical, mechanical and petrographic properties of strathbogie granite (obtained under room temperature and atmospheric pressure conditions). rock type granite colour average grain size petrographic description bulk density (kg/m3) compressive strength (mpa) elastic modulus (gpa) porosity (%) \\u242em white with dark brown 70–600 mainly consists of feldspar, biotite, quartz and plagioclase equigranular, coarse grained, s-type granite 2703.4 118.17 9.09 1.16 table 2 results of xrd analysis. mineral id alpha quartz sodic and intermediate plagioclase biotite—phlogopite k-feldspar clinochlore muscovite—sericite dolomite—ankerite other minerals mass% 50 16 15 13 2 2 1 1 granite that mainly consists of quartz, k-feldspar, cordierite and biotite (phillips et al., 1981). the selected granite type is coarsegrained and white and dark brown in colour with around 1.16% porosity. fig. 2 presents a close-up view of a typical strathbogie granite sample, an optical microscopic image and an sem image of its thin section. as can be seen in fig. 2(b), clear mineralogical assembling can be observed in the granite specimen, mainly with quartz, k-feldspar and plagioclase. as shown in fig. 3, the grain size was measured from a thin section of this granite and found to be \\u242em with only a small number mainly in the range of 0 mm–200 of larger grains (>300 mm) (shao et al., 2014). table 1 summarizes the physical, mechanical and petrographic properties of the tested strathbogie granite. in addition, an xrd analysis was conducted to determine the mineralogical composition of the selected granite and the result is shown in table 2. as the table shows, quartz is the predominant mineral in the selected granite (50%), followed by 16% of sodic and intermediate biotite and 15% of plagioclase. the mineralogical composition of this particular granitic composition is representative of the composition of the majority of the earth’s granites (best, 1995). all the physical properties in tables 1 and 2\\x0c46 w.g.p. kumari et al. / geothermics 65 (2017) 44–59 fig. 2.

(a) dilatancy and failure by strain softening under relatively low conﬁning pressures and (b) failure by strain hardening under elevated conﬁning pressures, and a transitional regime may be observed at intermediate pressures. these transitional failure modes have been referred to as “quasi-brittle”, and complex localized features such as conjugate shear bands can be observed under such conditions (klein et al., 2001; gajo et al., 2004). by visual inspection of the post-failure samples, important information about the alteration of the granite failure mechanism with conﬁning pressures and temperatures can be identiﬁed. postfailure images (fig. 5) were therefore collected after each test. according to the post-failure images, specimens that failed at 10–60 mpa conﬁning pressures mainly failed by shear localization along an inclined macroscopic shear band with a single shear zone across each sample. however, samples tested at higher conﬁnements of 90 mpa and 120 mpa (at 100 ◦c) exhibited strain hardening characteristics after achieving the peak stress, and several conjugate shear bands could be observed on the cylindrical sample surface, instead of the single shear band observed earlier. this characteristic was signiﬁcant at 120 mpa conﬁning pressure. however, it should be noted that only one test was conducted at 120 mpa conﬁnement, because at such high conﬁning pressures the corresponding failure load of granite exceeds the bottom pedestal’s load-bearing capacity. further, a progressive reduction was observed in the failure plane angle with respect to the minor principal stress direction with increasing conﬁning pressure, which implies a reduction in friction angle, possibly due to the greater quasi-brittle behaviour that was shown by granite samples at higher conﬁning pressures (wong et al., 2001). 3.2. effect of temperature and conﬁning pressure on mechanical properties of strathbogie granite fig. 6 illustrates the inﬂuence of temperature on the deviatoric stress of the tested granite under each conﬁnement. as the ﬁgure shows, the inﬂuence of conﬁnement is more signiﬁcant than that of temperature in the temperature range considered here. wong and brace (1979) conﬁrm that at lower conﬁning pressures considerable thermal cracking occurs at relatively low temperatures. if thermal cracking is responsible for the reduction in failure strength, a sharp reduction in deviatoric stress with increasing temperature (with suppression of thermal cracks) should be exhibited under unconﬁned pressure condition. however, based on the experimental results, under unconﬁned conditions, up to 100 ◦c, 17.6% of increment in deviatoric stress is followed by 2.5% and 10.5% reductions at 200 ◦c and 300 ◦c, respectively. however, when conﬁnement was applied, strength reduction was initiated after higher temperature of 200 ◦c, mainly due to the inhibition of a thermal cracks by induced compressive force. thermal cracking is therefore an important strength property alteration mechanism in reservoir rocks under certain conﬁning pressure conditions. a clear inﬂuence of temperature on deviatoric stress at any depth or conﬁnement can be observed, and increasing the temperature from room temperature to 200 ◦c causes an increment in deviatoric stress, and further increasing of temperature to 300 ◦c causes a slight reduction in it. this is because the thermal expansion which occurs with increasing temperature causes the reduction of fig. 3. (a) high-pressure, high-temperature tri-axial machine (b) inside view of the cell. ing calibration. however, it should be noted that, compared to the large axial load, this resistance is negligible which is only 0.19% of maximum measurement. during the load application, the axial strain was measured using linear variable differential transducers (lvdts) attached to the ram of the load cell (fig. 3(a)). an acoustic emission (ae) system was also employed in the testing of samples to record the data related to the fracturing process. the ae system adopted was a peripheral component interconnection (pci) system with a nominal resolution frequency of 500 khz. during the experiments, two sensors were attached to either side of the loading shaft and with the external ampliﬁers, which generated low frequency acoustic waves with the fracturing of the sample. in addition, possible micro-structural and mineralogical changes that occurred during thermal and conﬁnement effects were checked using sem analyses. 3. results and discussion 3.1. the overall stress-strain response the inﬂuence of temperature on the stress-strain behaviour of the tested granite was considered ﬁrst and the test results (deviatoric load at failure, deviatoric stress at failure, triaxial compressive strength and elastic modulus) are given in table 3. fig. 4 illustrates the relationships between deviatoric stress and axial strain curves for the samples tested at 10, 30, 60 and 90 mpa conﬁning pressures at various temperatures (20, 100, 200, 300 ◦c). in relation to the stress-strain curves of the strathbogie granite under triaxial loading, the corresponding failure modes were characterized\\x0c48 w.g.p. kumari et al. / geothermics 65 (2017) 44–59 table 3 mechanical properties of

pre-existing grain boundaries between mineral grains with different thermoelastic moduli and thermal conductivities, resulting in reduced rock strength (kranz, 1983; homand-etienne and houpert, 1989). according to the tri-axial experimental studies conducted by wong (1982) and tullis and yund (1977), increasing the temperature leads to reduction in the failure stress of westerly granite under any

conﬁning pressure. the reductions of strength characteristics were relatively small up to 500 ◦c and beyond that an accelerated downward trend was identiﬁed. furthermore, wider localized zones were observed at high temperatures in the post-failure images. however, these studies were conducted at wider temperature ranges (up to 700 ◦c and 900 ◦c, respectively) and the researchers therefore did not pay close attention to reservoir rock behaviour under relatively low geothermal temperature ranges (<300 ◦c). this was the focus of the present study, according to which there is an initial strengthening and stiffening in granite with increasing temperature at low temperatures (up to 200 ◦c), and increasing the temperature beyond a certain value causes a gradual reduction in failure stress with increasing temperature. elastic modulus is an important mechanical property of any reservoir rock, and describes the brittle characteristics of the rock mass. it is therefore often used to evaluate many in-situ stress applications, including wellbore stability, fracturing possibility and tectonic stress distribution (heard and page, 1982). the temperature-dependent brittle properties (elastic modulus) of the tested granite were then evaluated. the elastic region of each stress-strain curve was used to calculate the temperature and pressure-dependent young’s moduli (e) and the results are shown in fig. 7. the axial strain was measured using lvdts attached to the loading ram with a linearity ±0.1% f.s (full scale) (±0.0075 mm) and inﬁnite resoluerror of tion (no hysteresis). an increment of the modulus of strathbogie granite with increasing temperature up to 200 ◦c can be observed, and further increase of temperature (to 300 ◦c) causes the elastic modulus to be slightly reduced for any conﬁnement. this trend is\\x0ca ‘brittle’ or general increment in elastic modulus with increasing conﬁnement can be observed until 90 mpa, and a further increase of conﬁnement (to 120 mpa) reduces the young’s modulus considerably. with increasing conﬁning stress additional plastic deformation occurs, exhibiting strain-hardening characteristics in granite under high conﬁnements. however, within the range of the experiments conducted (10 mpa–120 mpa) it cannot be deﬁnitively identiﬁed as a ’ductile’ regime. however, the strain-hardening behaviour observed at 120 mpa indicates transitional characteristics and this can be identiﬁed as ‘quasi-brittle’ behaviour (klein et al., 2001). the initial young’s modulus reduction with increasing conﬁnement was observed by heard and page (1982), who conducted tests up to 55 mpa conﬁning pressure. however, the latter behaviour was not observed by these researchers. interestingly, according to the research literature, at low temperatures (<200 ◦c) some granite types are more temperature-sensitive, while in contrast, some granites are more temperature-sensitive at high temperatures. the initial strength enhancement is more signiﬁcant for coarse-grained granites and granodiorite than for ﬁne-grained granites. for example, according to heard and page (1982), stripa granite is more sensitive to temperature at relatively low temperatures (<200 ◦c), and westerly granite is more sensitive to temperature at high temperatures (>200 ◦c). such contradictory behaviours may occur in granite due to the different grain size distributions, grain orientations, mineralogical compositions and heterogeneity of different granite types. this indicates the importance of studying the mineralogical composition and microstructural inﬂuence of granites on such on temperature-dependent strength variations. 3.3. effect of temperature on shear strength parameters of strathbogie granite fig. 8 illustrates the variation of deviatoric stress of the tested granite with conﬁning pressure for each temperature. the ﬁgure shows that increasing conﬁnement causes the granite’s deviatoric stress to increase non-linearly and gradually come to a steady state. this is consistent with similar previous studies, which have clearly shown the enhancement of rock strength with increasing conﬁnement, and the increasing rate is reduced with increasing conﬁning pressure (barton, 2013; singh et al., 2011). this is because at low conﬁning pressures there is a high dilation potential. therefore, the ability to open rock micro-cracks is high, resulting in higher friction angles. however, this dilation potential and the corresponding tendency for micro-cracks to open are suppressed with increasing conﬁnement, resulting in lower friction angles at higher conﬁning pressures. therefore, the failure mechanism of the rocks shifts from brittle to ductile with increasing conﬁnement, changing the shape of the mohr-coulomb failure envelope, and according to barton (1976), at critical conﬁning pressure the mohr-coulomb failure envelope reaches a zero gradient. this has also been shown by hoek (1983). the present study has clearly identiﬁed this rock behaviour in the mohr-coulomb failure envelopes developed for each temperature condition (refer to fig. 9). according to fig. 9, the traditional linear mohr-coulomb criteria are applicable only in the brittle region of the failure envelope, and at higher conﬁnew.g.p. kumari et al. / geothermics 65 (2017) 44–59 consistent with the temperature-dependent strength behaviour of the granite described above. the reason for the initial elastic module increment may be that the specimen becomes more brittle at the initial temperature ranges due to thermally-induced volumetric expansion and the associated pore volume reduction. the later slight reduction of young’s modulus with increasing temperature exhibits an enhancement in ductile behaviour (quasi-brittle characteristics) with further increase of temperature. this is possibly due to the increased crack density caused by the induced thermal crack development and the related weakening of the granite. 600

boundaries, dependent on the anisotropy of the rock matrix (due to potentially existing distinct mineral compounds in granite those may contain different thermo-elastic moduli and this may causes to generate different internal stresses with heating). according to wong and brace (1979), increasing the temperature causes the induction of thermal cracks in the rock mass due to the associated

(2)) exceeds the crack closure pressure with increasing temperature, thermal cracks form and further increase of temperature provides the surface energy required for the propagation of the initiated crack (zuo et al., 2007). this results in alteration of the grain-tograin contacts in the rock matrix, which leads to reduced cohesion at higher temperatures. in the case of the variation of friction angle with increasing temperature, the granite friction angle appears to remain steady up to around 100 ◦c (52◦) and then slightly increases with increasing temperature (54◦ at 200 and 300 ◦ c, respectively). the friction between grain-to-grain contacts may be altered by the thermally-induced micro-structural modiﬁcations. however, this effect on grain contact is expected to be smaller at relatively low temperatures, resulting in relatively steady friction angle with increasing temperature at lower temperatures. however, a slight ments non-linearity must be taken into account. in addition to the conﬁnement, according to this study, increasing temperature also alters the failure envelope of granite. an initial increment in deviatoric stress with increasing temperature can be observed up to 200 ◦c and further increase of temperature (to 300 ◦c) causes it to be slightly reduced. the temperature-dependent shear parameters of granite were investigated next, and the shear parameters can be obtained from the mohr-coulomb failure envelope. as suggested by singh et al. (2011), the mohr-coulomb parameters (cohesion and friction angle) were calculated using eq. (1), taking into account the linear region of the obtained mohr-coulomb failure envelope (considering only smaller conﬁning stresses, up to 30 mpa) for each temperature condition to obtain the temperature-dependent shear strength parameters (fig. 10). (1) sin(cid:3) sin(cid:3) (cid:2)3 + − + 1 1 − (cid:2)1 = 2ccos(cid:3) sin(cid:3)i 1 \\u24341, \\u24343 are major principal stress and minor principal stress, where, and c and (cid:3) are cohesion and friction angle, respectively. according to fig. 10, cohesion increases from 20.7 to 25.7 mpa with increasing temperature from room temperature to 100 ◦c and further increases of temperature up to 200 ◦c and 300 ◦c cause the granite cohesion to be reduced to 24.8 mpa and 23.2 mpa, respectively. the observed cohesion gain at relatively low temperatures conﬁrms that thermally-induced rock matrix expansion induces a greater mutual attraction among individual minerals. this is also inﬂuenced by the inhibition of micro-crack propagation at relatively low temperatures (duclos and paquet, 1991). in relation to\\x0c52 w.g.p. kumari et al. / geothermics 65 (2017) 44–59 fig. 11. cumulative ae events vs. axial stress at different pressures and temperatures.\\x0cw.g.p. kumari et al. / geothermics 65 (2017) 44–59 53 fig. 11. (continued) enhancement in friction angle with increasing temperature can be seen, probably due to the increased resistance of mineral particles to external deformation as a result of the thermally-induced energy in the mineral particles. however, compared with cohesion, the temperature dependency on friction angle is relatively insigniﬁcant within the temperature region considered here. initial enhancement in shear parameters in sandstone with increasing temperature has been observed by zhang et al. (2015) at relatively low temperature regions, and these researchers observed reduction in friction angle from 33.02◦ to 31.93◦ and an increment a in cohesion from 61.47 mpa to 66.44 mpa with increasing temperature from 25 ◦c to 100 ◦c. further, bauer and johnson (1979) observed around 10% reduction in cohesion and 40% reduction in friction angle in westerly granite with increasing temperature from room temperature to 300 ◦c, and friedman et al. (1979) observed 7% reduction in cohesion and a 38% reduction in friction angle a with increasing temperature from room temperature to 400 ◦c and 300 ◦c, respectively. however, the variation of shear strength parameters with increasing temperature at relatively low temperatures (<300 ◦c) was not considered in the above studies. the observed initial shear strengthening may be due to the inhibition of micro-crack propagation by the plasticity mechanism which occurs at crack tips (duclos and paquet (1991)) at low temperatures. with further increment of temperature, the reduction of shear strength parameters can be expected, due to the thermal weakening of the rock micro-structure. furthermore, according to the sem studies conducted by zuo et al. (2007), large local plastic deformations and extremely rough cleavage fractures occur at relatively low temperatures. moreover, due to the volume expansion, the distance between the interfaces of the individual minerals decreases with the enhancement of their mutual attraction, and the strength of the bonds increases (dmitriev, 1972). both of these phenomena can be considered to explain the stress strengthening of granite under relatively low temperatures when subjected to conﬁning pressures. 3.4. analysis of fracturing behaviour using ae technology acoustic emission (ae) detection technology is a powerful nondestructive tool to study crack propagation processes in brittle materials, including the stages of crack initiation, growth and crack damage (lockner, 1993). when a brittle material is under stress, strain energy is released during the development of new cracks or the widening of existing cracks. this energy is released in the form of elastic stress waves from the crack tips, and can be captured and ampliﬁed by an ae system. ae detection technology has therefore been widely used in a number of previous studies to understand the crack development mechanism in brittle materials (chang and lee, 2004; lei et al., 2000; moura et al., 2005). by incorporating the crack propagation pattern into the stressstrain relationship of the cracking material, the crack development process can be divided into several stages. hoek and bieniawski (1965) divided crack formation into ﬁve main stages: crack closure, crack initiation, secondary cracking, crack coalescence and crack damage. later, ranjith et al. (2008) and shao et al. (2015) incorporated stress-strain curves into cumulative ae counts/energy and strain plots. in the crack propagation process, with the gradual increment of loading on brittle materials, most pre-existing cracks are ﬁrst closed, releasing an insigniﬁcant number of ae counts. this initial crack closure period is followed by the stable crack propagation period, which can be identiﬁed by the release of gradual ae energy increments. further increment of loading causes an exponential increase in ae energy, indicating an unstable crack propagation period with failure approaching. the crack closure threshold ((cid:2)cc) is deﬁned as the stress threshold at which the initial ae counts are identiﬁed. anan initial increment in cumulative ae\\x0c54 w.g.p. kumari et al. / geothermics 65 (2017) 44–59 counts can be seen at the crack initiation ((cid:2)ci) threshold, and the cumulative ae counts starts exponential growth at the crack damage ((cid:2)cd) threshold. the region between the crack closure threshold and the crack initiation threshold is generally deﬁned as the stable crack closure region, where linear elastic deformation occurs. the region between the crack initiation threshold and the crack damage threshold is deﬁned as the stable crack propagation region, and the region between the crack damage threshold and sample failure is identiﬁed as the unstable crack propagation region. the application of compressive loading fails rocks through either shear localization (brittle regime) or cataclastic ﬂow, and the surrounding conditions, such as temperatures and pressures, may cause a homogenous plastic ﬂow. according to existing studies, axial intra-granular cracking and shear rupturing of cemented grain contacts can be observed before failure in brittle regimes, and grain crushing and pore collapse can be identiﬁed before failure in cataclastic ﬂow regimes (menéndez et al., 1996). according to wong et al. (1997), the development of local stress concentrations leads to the initiation of many intra-granular micro-cracks in the rock mass, and the crack density increases with increasing deviatoric stress and tends to merge on reaching the peak stress, resulting in strain softening and shear localization. these damage processes are clearly identiﬁed by the intense ae activities in the ﬁeld (chang and lee, 2004). ae technology was therefore used to investigate the progressive fracturing behaviour in strathbogie granite under tri-axial conditions. fig. 11 illustrates the cumulative ae events with axial stress at various pressures and temperatures for the tested specimens. the corresponding variations of deviatoric stress against strain are also included in the same plots to identify the stress thresholds for crack closure, crack initiation and crack damage (table 4). the very high ae counts in strathbogie granite at dilatancy in the pre-failure stage are due to the fact that ae waves generate when the local shear stress concentration at a grain contact is sufﬁciently high to rupture the grain boundaries, and frictional slips and grain rotations may occur once the grain contacts have lost their cohesion. in the present study, crack threshold ratios were deﬁned to identify the temperature and pressure-dependent crack propagation in the tested granite as follows, and fig. 12 shows the crack propagation stress threshold ratios of granite specimens tested at various conﬁning pressures and temperatures. crack closure stress threshold = deviatoric stress at crack closure stress deviatoric stress at failure ((cid:2)cc) crack initiation stress threshold = deviatoric stress at crack initiation stress deviatoric stress at failure ((cid:2)ci) crack damage stress threshold = deviatoric stress at crack damage stress ((cid:2)cd) deviatoric stress at failure according to the results, the beginning of crack damage occurs at earlier stages of deviatoric loading for higher conﬁning pressures. however, the crack damage stress increases with increasing conﬁnement due to the inﬂuence of conﬁning pressure on thermal crack development and the suppression of the extension/widening of existing micro-cracks. according to fig. 12, in the temperature range considered here, three tendencies can be identiﬁed with increasing conﬁning pressure: increase of the elastic deformation region, decrease of the stable crack propagation region, and increase of the unstable crack propagation region. the crack initiation stress threshold also progressively increases with increasing conﬁning pressure, which can be attributed to the fact that the brittle behaviour of rock specimens at lower conﬁning pressures changes to quasi-brittle behaviour with increasing conﬁning pressure. this is because the suppression of micro-crack development is less at low conﬁning pressures, and therefore sudden failures mostly occur, and the beginning of crack initiation occurs at earlier stages of deviatoric loading at high conﬁning pressures due to the higher normal stress acting on micro-cracks, resulting in limited progression of cracking before failure. in relation to the temperature effect, increasing the temperature causes an initial increment in the crack propagation stress threshold, followed by a slight reduction for all the temperature conditions considered. for example, at 30 mpa conﬁnement, the crack damage stress threshold ratios increased by around 6.8%, 10.5% with increasing temperature from room temperature to 100 and 200 ◦c, respectively, and reduced by around 4.0% when the temperature increased to 300 ◦c. this implies that at low temperatures a suppressed micro-crack development mechanism is dominant, and increasing the temperature causes crack damage to occur at earlier loading stages. interestingly, at 60 mpa conﬁnement the crack damage stress threshold ratio increased by around 4.9%, 5.4%, 2.6% with increasing temperature from room to 100, 200 and 300 ◦c, respectively. this exhibits the cumulative effect of temperature and pressure micro-crack development in the rock mass. at relatively low temperatures, micro-crack propagation may be inhibited by the thermally-induced plasticity mechanism which occurs at crack tips and the increased bonding strength through thermally-induced rock matrix expansion (which increases crack stress thresholds). however, further increase of temperature creates thermally-induced cracks and causes the grain boundary cracks to widen, resulting in early crack damage. further, with the inﬂuence of conﬁnement, micro-crack development is suppressed, causing a relatively low increment of crack damage stress threshold ratios at higher conﬁnements. 3.5. corresponding alterations in granite micro-structure a comprehensive micro-structural analysis was also performed to identify the interior correspondences of the above-described temperature-dependent mechanical behaviour of granite. sem and optical microscopic analyses were performed on thin sections of granite specimens at various temperatures: room temperature (20 ◦c), pre-heated (72 hours) to 200 ◦c and 400 ◦c (fig. 13). these temperatures were selected to identify the microstructural behaviour at 200 ◦c, at which the highest strength increment was observed, and 400 ◦c, at which clear thermally-induced rock mass weakening was observed. a specimen at room temperature was used as a control. based on optical microscope imaging, mineralogical assembling in the granite specimen could be identiﬁed by the colour and texture of each of the mineral assemblages. further, a detailed sem study was performed using scanning electron imaging (sei) and bsei back-scatter electron imaging (bsei) techniques. bsei images taken at low magniﬁcations clearly show different mineral assemblages and grain boundaries (see fig. 14). using energy-dispersive x-ray (edx) technology with aztec oxford instruments, chemical component mapping was generated in each specimen, and each mineral was identiﬁed qualitatively. the bright colour images observed in edx images indicate higher concentration (higher energy dispersion) while dark colour areas indicate lower concentration (lower energy dispersion). based on the spectrum of each point (point id), the corresponding mineral was identiﬁed and a map spectrum provided overall elements available for each specimen. according to figs. 13 and 14, there are clear mineralogical assembling in the granite specimens, mainly with quartz, kfeldspar and plagioclase. the heating of granite up to 200 ◦c temperature has not caused any signiﬁcant thermally-induced micro-cracks (in addition to the pre-existing faults and grain boundaries) and almost all grain boundaries remain intact. however, further heating of granite to the higher temperature of 400 ◦c caused the induction of some micro-cracks, mainly along\\x0cw.g.p. kumari et al. / geothermics

however, only a few grain\\x0c56 w.g.p. kumari et al. / geothermics 65 (2017) 44–59 fig. 13. optical microscopic and sem images of thin sections of strathbogie granite (a) at room temperature; (b) pre-heated to 100 ◦c (c) pre-heated to 400 ◦c. boundaries have been partially parted and a signiﬁcant number of grain boundaries appear to remain intact up to this temperature. furthermore, based on the edx mapping, it was conﬁrmed that intra-granular cracks are mainly initiated along the feldspar and quartz minerals. intragranular cracks were mainly observed in larger crystals (crystals greater than 0.5 mm) and smaller crystals remained un-parted even at 400 ◦c. for strathbogie granite, thermally-induced intra-granular micro-cracks seem to play a signiﬁcant role at relatively low temperatures, probably due to the presence of relatively high k feldspar and biotite contents. similar observations have been reported in bauer and johnson’s (1979) study conducted for charcoal granite, where intra-granular microcracks predominantly occur compared to grain boundary cracks. the sem analysis is also consistent with this ﬁnding, which exhibits inhibition of micro-crack development followed by micro-cracking at relatively high temperatures. the crack propagation process in any rock mass is largely inﬂuenced by the mineralogical composition, because cracks normally propagate through weaker planes of the rock mass. since granite is an igneous type of rock, two main types of thermallyinduced cracking modes can be identiﬁed: inter-granular and intragranular. the amount of inter-granular or intra-granular cracking is dependent on the stress state, rock type and mineralogy of the rock mass. inter-granular cracks occur along grain boundaries, pre-existing faults and micro-cracks of the rock, while intragranular cracks occur through weaker mineralogical constituents (kranz, 1983). for example, k feldspar and biotite are weaker mineralogical constituents due to their large crystals (>10 mm), as crystals greater than 2–3 mm in size are generally deﬁned as weaker mineralogical constituents compared to equi-dimensional small crystals like quartz (homand-etienne and houpert, 1989). based on experimental results, intra-granular cracking is highly temperature-dependent due to the temperature dependent dislocations in the rocks. this is because different mineralogical components have different thermo-elastic moduli and thermal conductivities (kranz, 1983; dwivedi et al., 2008). these observations suggest that micro-cracking in granite is highly temperature dependent, as evidenced by the previously observed initial strength gain followed by slight strength reduction with increasing temperature in the tested granite. however, this shows that granite needs to be heated to a sufﬁcient temperature to cause thermal cracks in it and therefore, heating to a lower temperature may only cause a strength gain through the thermal expansion of the rock matrix. this is consistent with the results of bauer and johnson (1979). the mechanical properties of charcoal granite in their study remained relatively steady until 200 ◦c, and westerly granite exhibited a signiﬁcant thermal dependency, even at relatively low temperatures (<200 ◦c). in homand-etienne and houpert (1989) study, the variation of uni-axial compressive strength of both semones and remiremont granites is insigniﬁcant until 400 ◦c, followed by signiﬁcant reductions at higher temperatures. these results indicate the dependency of mineralogical composition and grain size distribution on the temperature dependent mechanical behaviour in various types of granites. however,\\x0cw.g.p. kumari et al. / geothermics 65 (2017) 44–59 57 fig. 14. bse images of strathbogie

granite under four different conﬁning pressures (10, 30, 60, 90 mpa) and four different temperatures (rt, 100, 200, 300 ◦c), simulating various geothermal reservoir conditions. the following conclusions can be drawn: mechanical behaviour of the tested granite is inﬂuenced by both reservoir depth and temperature, and the depth effect is much greater than the temperature effect. granite located at relatively smaller depths appears to fail through shear localization and increasing depth may cause this to change to ductile failure through strain hardening. a progressive enhancement in stress threshold with increasing conﬁning pressure is observed in strathbogie granite. such behaviours exhibit greater strength and lower brittle characteristics in granite located at greater depths. increasing of temperature causes granite’s strength to be enhanced up to a certain temperature (around 200 ◦c for strathbogie granite) through the possible thermal expansion of the rock matrix and further increasing of temperature may cause it to weaken by inducing thermal cracks. this was conﬁrmed by the micro-structural analysis, which did not reveal any noticeable amount of thermally-induced micro-cracking in strathbogie granite up to 200 ◦c, and heating of the granite to a greater temperature as 400 ◦c caused many intra-granular cracks in quartz and feldspar and some grain boundary cracks between quartz and feldspar minerals. furthermore, according to ae analysis, increasing the temperature ﬁrst causes the crack propagation stress threshold to increase and further increasing of the temperature causes it to be slightly reduced. this indicates a suppression of micro-cracks at low temperatures by matrix expansion and the development of micro-cracks through thermally-induced damage at higher temperatures. finally an attempt was made to improve the conventional mohrcoulomb failure criteria for geothermal reservoirs with extreme pressures and temperatures, because the conventional criteria are not applicable to extreme conditions. acknowledgements this research project is funded by the australian research council (arc dp160104223) and the authors would like to

the present study may therefore capture more realistic geothermal reservoir behaviour. 3.6. temperature-dependent failure criteria for strathbogie granite ≤ (3) − is questionable, due to the to date, although many strength criteria are available for intact rock, the practical application of most of them for geothermal reservoirs in-situ model parameters required when considering the available high-pressure and high-temperature environment in underground reservoirs. of the various failure criteria, the mohr-coulomb failure criteria have been extensively used in the ﬁeld and have made a signiﬁcant contribution to the determination of rock mass failure. however, they have some major limitations, including ignoring the intermediate stress (cid:2)2 inﬂuence (which has been proven to have a substantial inﬂuence on rock strength) and the assumed linearity (the strength criteria of rock are non-linear in reality). after re-analyzing thousands of reported triaxial experiments and combining the critical state concept proposed by barton (1976), singh et al. (2011) proposed a non-linear mohr-coulomb failure criterion. according to the ﬁndings of singh et al. (2011), the mohr-coulomb shear strength parameters should only be obtained by performing conventional tri-axial tests under low conﬁning stresses (in the linear region of the mohr-coulomb failure envelope). according to their statistical analysis, (cid:2)cc ≈ (cid:2)crit, where (cid:2)c and (cid:2) crit are uni-axial compressive strength and critical conﬁning pressure, respectively. the modiﬁed mohr-coulomb failure criterion proposed by singh et al. is given below: (cid:2)1 − (cid:2)3 = where, (cid:2)ci ≈ (cid:2)ci + 2sin(cid:3)i0 sin(cid:3)i0 ucs of the rock = 2ciocos(cid:3)i0/1 sin(cid:3)i0, (cid:3)i0 and cio are friction angle and cohesion obtained at low conﬁning pressures. sin(cid:3)i0) (cid:2)32 2sin(cid:3)i0 (cid:2)3 ≤ (cid:2)3 − (cid:2)crit (1 for 0 (cid:2)crit − − 1 however, even the improved mohr-coulomb failure criteria cannot be directly applied to geothermal reservoir rocks at extreme pressures and temperatures, because the strength response is altered by the thermal effect (heuze, 1983). to date, no extensive study has captured this thermal response in the improved mohrcoulomb failure criteria. such a realistic approach is necessary for deep underground engineering applications like geothermal energy extraction. the concepts of barton (1976) and singh et al. (2011) are therefore incorporated into the temperature inﬂuence in this study and an attempt is made to propose novel strength criteria for geothermal reservoir rocks based on experimental data: + 2sin(cid:3)i (t) sin(cid:3)i (t) (cid:2)3 − − 1 − (cid:2)3 (t) = 2ci (t) cos(cid:3)i (t) sin(cid:3)i (t) 1 (cid:2)1 − (4) (cid:2)3 ≤ (cid:2)crit ≤ sin(cid:3)i (t)) (cid:2)32 for 0 − (cid:2)crit (t) (1

, 2008). however, such alterations are also affected by the conﬁnement applying on the rock mass, and conﬁning pressure causes the suppression of thermal cracks and the extension/widening of existing micro-cracks. this results in further alteration of the rock mass mechanical properties, resulting in changing failure modes (mogi, 1966). studies have identiﬁed the transition of rock failure mode from brittle to ductile with increasing conﬁnement. however, this transition is diverse due to the different mineralogical compositions and grain boundaries in different rocks (, 2001; wong, 1982). although many studies have been conducted to investigate the temperature-dependent mechanical behaviour of reservoir rocks, most experiments have been conducted in unconﬁned environments (, 2015; , 2014). pre-heating the specimens to the corresponding temperature ranges and testing at room temperatures has been frequently done (bauer and johnson, 1979; , 2008), but the method is not reliable, as geothermal reservoirs experience continuous thermal stresses. such limitations have occurred mainly due to the limited number of appropriate test facilities available to simulate the stress and temperature conditions of actual geothermal reservoirs. although some studies have analytically and numerically evaluated the mechanical properties of rocks under high temperatures and pressures (chester and higgs, 1992; , 2013; , 2016), to date none has captured the stress-strain behaviour and failure criteria of rocks over a wide range of conﬁning pressures and temperatures, particularly for australian granite. however, the thermo-elastic response and appropriate failure criteria are essential inputs for many engineering applications under high pressures and temperatures, including geothermal extraction applications. this study therefore intends to ﬁll this gap, and it is hoped it will make an important contribution to many deep underground applications. 2. methodology 2.1. tested material granite is an abundant crystalline rock in the earth with medium to coarse grains which was formed as a result of the slow cooling of magma. granite therefore has abundant radioactive elements (k, th, and u). such elements bring elevated geothermal gradients to deep granite reservoirs, which therefore have ideal conditions as geothermal reservoirs. the mineralogical composition of granite mainly consists of quartz, feldspar, plagioclase and biotite, and small amounts of muscovite, amphibole, hornblende and opaque (, 2008). for the present study, samples were collected from the strathbogie batholith, which is a composite granitoid intrusion body spreading over more than 1500 km2 in 150 km north-east from melbourne (fig. 1). strathbogie granite is a high-level, discordant fig. 1. sampling location of strathbogie batholith in central victoria. table 1 physical, mechanical and petrographic properties of strathbogie granite (obtained under room temperature and atmospheric pressure conditions). rock type granite colour average grain size petrographic description bulk density (kg/m3) compressive strength (mpa) elastic modulus (gpa) porosity (%) \\u242em white with dark brown 70–600 mainly consists of feldspar, biotite, quartz and plagioclase equigranular, coarse grained, s-type granite 2703.4 118.17 9.09 1.16 table 2 results of xrd analysis. mineral id alpha quartz sodic and intermediate plagioclase biotite—phlogopite k-feldspar clinochlore muscovite—sericite dolomite—ankerite other minerals mass% 50 16 15 13 2 2 1 1 granite that mainly consists of quartz, k-feldspar, cordierite and biotite (, 1981). the selected granite type is coarsegrained and white and dark brown in colour with around 1.16% porosity. fig. 2 presents a close-up view of a typical strathbogie granite sample, an optical microscopic image and an sem image of its thin section. as can be seen in fig. 2(b), clear mineralogical assembling can be observed in the granite specimen, mainly with quartz, k-feldspar and plagioclase. as shown in fig. 3, the grain size was measured from a thin section of this granite and found to be \\u242em with only a small number mainly in the range of 0 mm–200 of larger grains (>300 mm) (, 2014). table 1 summarizes the physical, mechanical and petrographic properties of the tested strathbogie granite. in addition, an xrd analysis was conducted to determine the mineralogical composition of the selected granite and the result is shown in table 2. as the table shows, quartz is the predominant mineral in the selected granite (50%), followed by 16% of sodic and intermediate biotite and 15% of plagioclase. the mineralogical composition of this particular granitic composition is representative of the composition of the majority of the earth’s granites (best, 1995). all the physical properties in tables 1 and 2\\x0c46 w.g.p.  / geothermics 65 (2017) 44–59 fig. 2.

(a) dilatancy and failure by strain softening under relatively low conﬁning pressures and (b) failure by strain hardening under elevated conﬁning pressures, and a transitional regime may be observed at intermediate pressures. these transitional failure modes have been referred to as “quasi-brittle”, and complex localized features such as conjugate shear bands can be observed under such conditions (, 2001; , 2004). by visual inspection of the post-failure samples, important information about the alteration of the granite failure mechanism with conﬁning pressures and temperatures can be identiﬁed. postfailure images (fig. 5) were therefore collected after each test. according to the post-failure images, specimens that failed at 10–60 mpa conﬁning pressures mainly failed by shear localization along an inclined macroscopic shear band with a single shear zone across each sample. however, samples tested at higher conﬁnements of 90 mpa and 120 mpa (at 100 ◦c) exhibited strain hardening characteristics after achieving the peak stress, and several conjugate shear bands could be observed on the cylindrical sample surface, instead of the single shear band observed earlier. this characteristic was signiﬁcant at 120 mpa conﬁning pressure. however, it should be noted that only one test was conducted at 120 mpa conﬁnement, because at such high conﬁning pressures the corresponding failure load of granite exceeds the bottom pedestal’s load-bearing capacity. further, a progressive reduction was observed in the failure plane angle with respect to the minor principal stress direction with increasing conﬁning pressure, which implies a reduction in friction angle, possibly due to the greater quasi-brittle behaviour that was shown by granite samples at higher conﬁning pressures (, 2001). 3.2. effect of temperature and conﬁning pressure on mechanical properties of strathbogie granite fig. 6 illustrates the inﬂuence of temperature on the deviatoric stress of the tested granite under each conﬁnement. as the ﬁgure shows, the inﬂuence of conﬁnement is more signiﬁcant than that of temperature in the temperature range considered here. wong and brace (1979) conﬁrm that at lower conﬁning pressures considerable thermal cracking occurs at relatively low temperatures. if thermal cracking is responsible for the reduction in failure strength, a sharp reduction in deviatoric stress with increasing temperature (with suppression of thermal cracks) should be exhibited under unconﬁned pressure condition. however, based on the experimental results, under unconﬁned conditions, up to 100 ◦c, 17.6% of increment in deviatoric stress is followed by 2.5% and 10.5% reductions at 200 ◦c and 300 ◦c, respectively. however, when conﬁnement was applied, strength reduction was initiated after higher temperature of 200 ◦c, mainly due to the inhibition of a thermal cracks by induced compressive force. thermal cracking is therefore an important strength property alteration mechanism in reservoir rocks under certain conﬁning pressure conditions. a clear inﬂuence of temperature on deviatoric stress at any depth or conﬁnement can be observed, and increasing the temperature from room temperature to 200 ◦c causes an increment in deviatoric stress, and further increasing of temperature to 300 ◦c causes a slight reduction in it. this is because the thermal expansion which occurs with increasing temperature causes the reduction of fig. 3. (a) high-pressure, high-temperature tri-axial machine (b) inside view of the cell. ing calibration. however, it should be noted that, compared to the large axial load, this resistance is negligible which is only 0.19% of maximum measurement. during the load application, the axial strain was measured using linear variable differential transducers (lvdts) attached to the ram of the load cell (fig. 3(a)). an acoustic emission (ae) system was also employed in the testing of samples to record the data related to the fracturing process. the ae system adopted was a peripheral component interconnection (pci) system with a nominal resolution frequency of 500 khz. during the experiments, two sensors were attached to either side of the loading shaft and with the external ampliﬁers, which generated low frequency acoustic waves with the fracturing of the sample. in addition, possible micro-structural and mineralogical changes that occurred during thermal and conﬁnement effects were checked using sem analyses. 3. results and discussion 3.1. the overall stress-strain response the inﬂuence of temperature on the stress-strain behaviour of the tested granite was considered ﬁrst and the test results (deviatoric load at failure, deviatoric stress at failure, triaxial compressive strength and elastic modulus) are given in table 3. fig. 4 illustrates the relationships between deviatoric stress and axial strain curves for the samples tested at 10, 30, 60 and 90 mpa conﬁning pressures at various temperatures (20, 100, 200, 300 ◦c). in relation to the stress-strain curves of the strathbogie granite under triaxial loading, the corresponding failure modes were characterized\\x0c48 w.g.p.  / geothermics 65 (2017) 44–59 table 3 mechanical properties of strathbogie granite at

increases their mutual attraction and bonding strength (dmitriev, 1972). however, further increase of temperature causes the crystalline particles of the rock mass to fracture through pre-existing grain boundaries between mineral grains with different thermoelastic moduli and thermal conductivities, resulting in reduced rock strength (kranz, 1983; homand-etienne and houpert, 1989). according to

reductions of strength characteristics were relatively small up to 500 ◦c and beyond that an accelerated downward trend was identiﬁed. furthermore, wider localized zones were observed at high temperatures in the post-failure images. however, these studies were conducted at wider temperature ranges (up to 700 ◦c and 900 ◦c, respectively) and the researchers therefore did not pay close attention to reservoir rock behaviour under relatively low geothermal temperature ranges (<300 ◦c). this was the focus of the present study, according to which there is an initial strengthening and stiffening in granite with increasing temperature at low temperatures (up to 200 ◦c), and increasing the temperature beyond a certain value causes a gradual reduction in failure stress with increasing temperature. elastic modulus is an important mechanical property of any reservoir rock, and describes the brittle characteristics of the rock mass. it is therefore often used to evaluate many in-situ stress applications, including wellbore stability, fracturing possibility and tectonic stress distribution (heard and page, 1982). the temperature-dependent brittle properties (elastic modulus) of the tested granite were then evaluated. the elastic region of each stress-strain curve was used to calculate the temperature and pressure-dependent young’s moduli (e) and the results are shown in fig. 7.

of strathbogie granite with increasing temperature up to 200 ◦c can be observed, and further increase of temperature (to 300 ◦c) causes the elastic modulus to be slightly reduced for any conﬁnement. this trend is\\x0ca ‘brittle’ or general increment in elastic modulus with increasing conﬁnement can be observed until 90 mpa, and a further increase of conﬁnement (to 120 mpa) reduces the young’s modulus considerably. with increasing conﬁning stress additional plastic deformation occurs, exhibiting strain-hardening characteristics in granite under high conﬁnements. however, within the range of the experiments conducted (10 mpa–120 mpa) it cannot be deﬁnitively identiﬁed as a ’ductile’ regime. however, the strain-hardening behaviour observed at 120 mpa indicates transitional characteristics and this can be identiﬁed as ‘quasi-brittle’ behaviour (, 2001). the initial young’s modulus reduction with increasing conﬁnement was observed by heard and page (1982), who conducted tests up to 55 mpa conﬁning pressure. however, the latter behaviour was not observed by these researchers. interestingly, according to the research literature, at low temperatures (<200 ◦c) some granite types are more temperature-sensitive, while in contrast, some granites are more temperature-sensitive at high temperatures. the initial strength enhancement is more signiﬁcant for coarse-grained granites and granodiorite than for ﬁne-grained granites. for example, according to heard and page (1982), stripa granite is more sensitive to temperature at relatively low temperatures (<200 ◦c), and westerly granite is more sensitive to temperature at high temperatures (>200 ◦c). such contradictory behaviours may occur in granite due to the different grain size distributions, grain orientations, mineralogical compositions and heterogeneity of different granite types. this indicates the importance of studying the mineralogical composition and microstructural inﬂuence of granites on such on temperature-dependent strength variations. 3.3. effect of temperature on shear strength parameters of strathbogie granite fig. 8 illustrates the variation of deviatoric stress of the tested granite with conﬁning pressure for each temperature. the ﬁgure shows that increasing conﬁnement causes the granite’s deviatoric stress to increase non-linearly and gradually come to a steady state. this is consistent with similar previous studies, which have clearly shown the enhancement of rock strength with increasing conﬁnement, and the increasing rate is reduced with increasing conﬁning pressure (barton, 2013; , 2011). this is because at low conﬁning pressures there is a high dilation potential. therefore, the ability to open rock micro-cracks is high, resulting in higher friction angles. however, this dilation potential and the corresponding tendency for micro-cracks to open are suppressed with increasing conﬁnement, resulting in lower friction angles at higher conﬁning pressures. therefore, the failure mechanism of the rocks shifts from brittle to ductile with increasing conﬁnement, changing the shape of the mohr-coulomb failure envelope, and according to barton (1976), at critical conﬁning pressure the mohr-coulomb failure envelope reaches a zero gradient. this has also been shown by hoek (1983). the present study has clearly identiﬁed this rock behaviour in the mohr-coulomb failure envelopes developed for each temperature condition (refer to fig. 9). according to fig. 9, the traditional linear mohr-coulomb criteria are applicable only in the brittle region of the failure envelope, and at higher conﬁnew.g.p.  / geothermics 65 (2017) 44–59 consistent with the temperature-dependent strength behaviour of the granite described above. the reason for the initial elastic module increment may be that the specimen becomes more brittle at the initial temperature ranges due to thermally-induced volumetric expansion and the associated pore volume reduction. the later slight reduction of young’s modulus with increasing temperature exhibits an enhancement in ductile behaviour (quasi-brittle characteristics) with further increase of temperature. this is possibly due to the increased crack density caused by the induced thermal crack development and the related weakening of the granite. 600 500 400 300 200 100 0 50 σ1-σ3(mpa) 0 100 temperature (ºc) 200

variation in (a) friction angle and (b) cohesion with different temperatures (considering linear region of the mohr coulomb failure envelope). the latter positive effect of temperature on cohesion, according to wong and brace (1979), increasing the temperature to an extreme value may cause weakening of the grain boundaries, dependent on the anisotropy of the rock matrix (due to potentially existing distinct mineral compounds in granite those may contain different thermo-elastic moduli and this may causes to generate different internal stresses with heating). according to wong and brace (1979), increasing the temperature causes the induction of thermal cracks in the rock mass due to the associated generation of internal stresses (eq. (2)): (2) e(cid:4)˛(cid:4)t = \\u2434 where, e, \\x01␣, \\x01t is the matrix young’s modulus, difference of thermal expansion coefﬁcient of distinct mineral and temperature difference, respectively. when the internal stress (given by eq. (2)) exceeds the crack closure pressure with increasing temperature, thermal cracks form and further increase of temperature provides the surface energy required for the propagation of the initiated crack (, 2007). this results in alteration of the grain-tograin contacts in the rock matrix, which leads to reduced cohesion at higher temperatures. in the case of the variation of friction angle with increasing temperature, the granite friction angle appears to remain steady up to around 100 ◦c (52◦) and then slightly increases with increasing temperature (54◦ at 200 and 300 ◦ c, respectively). the friction between grain-to-grain contacts may be altered by the thermally-induced micro-structural modiﬁcations. however, this effect on grain contact is expected to be smaller at relatively low temperatures, resulting in relatively steady friction angle with increasing temperature at lower temperatures. however, a slight ments non-linearity must be taken into account. in addition to the conﬁnement, according to this study, increasing temperature also alters the failure envelope of granite. an initial increment in deviatoric stress with increasing temperature can be observed up to 200 ◦c and further increase of temperature (to 300 ◦c) causes it to be slightly reduced. the temperature-dependent shear parameters of granite were investigated next, and the shear parameters can be obtained from the mohr-coulomb failure envelope. as suggested by  (2011), the mohr-coulomb parameters (cohesion and friction angle) were calculated using eq. (1), taking into account the linear region of the obtained mohr-coulomb failure envelope (considering only smaller conﬁning stresses, up to 30 mpa) for each temperature condition to obtain the temperature-dependent shear strength parameters (fig. 10). (1) sin(cid:3) sin(cid:3) (cid:2)3 + − + 1 1 − (cid:2)1 = 2ccos(cid:3) sin(cid:3)i 1 \\u24341, \\u24343 are major principal stress and minor principal stress, where, and c and (cid:3) are cohesion and friction angle, respectively. according to fig. 10, cohesion increases from 20.7 to 25.7 mpa with increasing temperature from room temperature to 100 ◦c and further increases of temperature up to 200 ◦c and 300 ◦c cause the granite cohesion to be reduced to 24.8 mpa and 23.2 mpa, respectively. the observed cohesion gain at relatively low temperatures conﬁrms that thermally-induced rock matrix expansion induces a greater mutual attraction among individual minerals. this is also inﬂuenced by the inhibition of micro-crack propagation at relatively low temperatures (duclos and paquet, 1991). in relation to\\x0c52 w.g.p.  / geothermics 65 (2017) 44–59 fig. 11. cumulative ae events vs. axial stress at different pressures and temperatures.\\x0cw.g.p.  / geothermics 65 (2017) 44–59 53 fig. 11. (continued) enhancement in friction angle with increasing temperature can be seen, probably due to the increased resistance of mineral particles to external deformation as a result of the thermally-induced energy in the mineral particles. however, compared with cohesion, the temperature dependency on friction angle is relatively insigniﬁcant within the temperature region considered here. initial enhancement in shear parameters in sandstone with increasing temperature has been observed by  (2015) at relatively low temperature regions, and these researchers observed reduction in friction angle from 33.02◦ to 31.93◦ and an increment a in cohesion from 61.47 mpa to 66.44 mpa with increasing temperature from 25 ◦c to 100 ◦c. further, bauer and johnson (1979) observed around 10% reduction in cohesion and 40% reduction in friction angle in westerly granite with increasing temperature from room temperature to 300 ◦c, and  (1979) observed 7% reduction in cohesion and a 38% reduction in friction angle a with increasing temperature from room temperature to 400 ◦c and 300 ◦c, respectively. however, the variation of shear strength parameters with increasing temperature at relatively low temperatures (<300 ◦c) was not considered in the above studies. the observed initial shear strengthening may be due to the inhibition of micro-crack propagation by the plasticity mechanism which occurs at crack tips (duclos and paquet (1991)) at low temperatures. with further increment of temperature, the reduction of shear strength parameters can be expected, due to the thermal weakening of the rock micro-structure. furthermore, according to the sem studies conducted by  (2007), large local plastic deformations and extremely rough cleavage fractures occur at relatively low temperatures. moreover, due to the volume expansion, the distance between the interfaces of the individual minerals decreases with the enhancement of their mutual attraction, and the strength of the bonds increases (dmitriev, 1972). both of these phenomena can be considered to explain the stress strengthening of granite under relatively low temperatures when subjected to conﬁning pressures. 3.4. analysis of fracturing behaviour using ae technology acoustic emission (ae) detection technology is a powerful nondestructive tool to study crack propagation processes in brittle materials, including the stages of crack initiation, growth and crack damage (lockner, 1993). when a brittle material is under stress, strain energy is released during the development of new cracks or the widening of existing cracks. this energy is released in the form of elastic stress waves from the crack tips, and can be captured and ampliﬁed by an ae system. ae detection technology has therefore been widely used in a number of previous studies to understand the crack development mechanism in brittle materials (chang and lee, 2004; , 2000; , 2005). by incorporating the crack propagation pattern into the stressstrain relationship of the cracking material, the crack development process can be divided into several stages. hoek and bieniawski (1965) divided crack formation into ﬁve main stages: crack closure, crack initiation, secondary cracking, crack coalescence and crack damage. later,  (2008) and  (2015) incorporated stress-strain curves into cumulative ae counts/energy and strain plots. in the crack propagation process, with the gradual increment of loading on brittle materials, most pre-existing cracks are ﬁrst closed, releasing an insigniﬁcant number of ae counts. this initial crack closure period is followed by the stable crack propagation period, which can be identiﬁed by the release of gradual ae energy increments. further increment of loading causes an exponential increase in ae energy, indicating an unstable crack propagation period with failure approaching. the crack closure threshold ((cid:2)cc) is deﬁned as the stress threshold at which the initial ae counts are identiﬁed. anan initial increment in cumulative ae\\x0c54 w.g.p.  / geothermics 65 (2017) 44–59 counts can be seen at the crack initiation ((cid:2)ci) threshold, and the cumulative ae counts starts exponential growth at the crack damage ((cid:2)cd) threshold. the region between the crack closure threshold and the crack initiation threshold is generally deﬁned as the stable crack closure region, where linear elastic deformation occurs. the region between the crack initiation threshold and the crack damage threshold is deﬁned as the stable crack propagation region, and the region between the crack damage threshold and sample failure is identiﬁed as the unstable crack propagation region. the application of compressive loading fails rocks through either shear localization (brittle regime) or cataclastic ﬂow, and the surrounding conditions, such as temperatures and pressures, may cause a homogenous plastic ﬂow. according to existing studies, axial intra-granular cracking and shear rupturing of cemented grain contacts can be observed before failure in brittle regimes, and grain crushing and pore collapse can be identiﬁed before failure in cataclastic ﬂow regimes (, 1996). according to  (1997), the development of local stress concentrations leads to the initiation of many intra-granular micro-cracks in the rock mass, and the crack density increases with increasing deviatoric stress and tends to merge on reaching the peak stress, resulting in strain softening and shear localization. these damage processes are clearly identiﬁed by the intense ae activities in the ﬁeld (chang and lee, 2004). ae technology was therefore used to investigate the progressive fracturing behaviour in strathbogie granite under tri-axial conditions. fig. 11 illustrates the cumulative ae events with axial stress at various pressures and temperatures for the tested specimens. the corresponding variations of deviatoric stress against strain are also included in the same plots to identify the stress thresholds for crack closure, crack initiation and crack damage (table 4). the very high ae counts in strathbogie granite at dilatancy in the pre-failure stage are due to the fact that ae waves generate when the local shear stress concentration at a grain contact is sufﬁciently high to rupture the grain boundaries, and frictional slips and grain rotations may occur once the grain contacts have lost their cohesion. in the present study, crack threshold ratios were deﬁned to identify the temperature and pressure-dependent crack propagation in the tested granite as follows, and fig. 12 shows the crack propagation stress threshold ratios of granite specimens tested at various conﬁning pressures and temperatures. crack closure stress threshold = deviatoric stress at crack closure stress deviatoric stress at failure ((cid:2)cc) crack initiation stress threshold = deviatoric stress at crack initiation stress deviatoric stress at failure ((cid:2)ci) crack damage stress threshold = deviatoric stress at crack damage stress ((cid:2)cd) deviatoric stress at failure according to the results, the beginning of crack damage occurs at earlier stages of deviatoric loading for higher conﬁning pressures. however, the crack damage stress increases with increasing conﬁnement due to the inﬂuence of conﬁning pressure on thermal crack development and the suppression of the extension/widening of existing micro-cracks. according to fig. 12, in the temperature range considered here, three tendencies can be identiﬁed with increasing conﬁning pressure: increase of the elastic deformation region, decrease of the stable crack propagation region, and increase of the unstable crack propagation region. the crack initiation stress threshold also progressively increases with increasing conﬁning pressure, which can be attributed to the fact that the brittle behaviour of rock specimens at lower conﬁning pressures changes to quasi-brittle behaviour with increasing conﬁning pressure. this is because the suppression of micro-crack development is less at low conﬁning pressures, and therefore sudden failures mostly occur, and the beginning of crack initiation occurs at earlier stages of deviatoric loading at high conﬁning pressures due to the higher normal stress acting on micro-cracks, resulting in limited progression of cracking before failure. in relation to the temperature effect, increasing the temperature causes an initial increment in the crack propagation stress threshold, followed by a slight reduction for all the temperature conditions considered. for example, at 30 mpa conﬁnement, the crack damage stress threshold ratios increased by around 6.8%, 10.5% with increasing temperature from room temperature to 100 and 200 ◦c, respectively, and reduced by around 4.0% when the temperature increased to 300 ◦c. this implies that at low temperatures a suppressed micro-crack development mechanism is dominant, and increasing the temperature causes crack damage to occur at earlier loading stages. interestingly, at 60 mpa conﬁnement the crack damage stress threshold ratio increased by around 4.9%, 5.4%, 2.6% with increasing temperature from room to 100, 200 and 300 ◦c, respectively. this exhibits the cumulative effect of temperature and pressure micro-crack development in the rock mass. at relatively low temperatures, micro-crack propagation may be inhibited by the thermally-induced plasticity mechanism which occurs at crack tips and the increased bonding strength through thermally-induced rock matrix expansion (which increases crack stress thresholds). however, further increase of temperature creates thermally-induced cracks and causes the grain boundary cracks to widen, resulting in early crack damage. further, with the inﬂuence of conﬁnement, micro-crack development is suppressed, causing a relatively low increment of crack damage stress threshold ratios at higher conﬁnements. 3.5. corresponding alterations in granite micro-structure a comprehensive micro-structural analysis was also performed to identify the interior correspondences of the above-described temperature-dependent mechanical behaviour of granite. sem and optical microscopic analyses were performed on thin sections of granite specimens at various temperatures: room temperature (20 ◦c), pre-heated (72 hours) to 200 ◦c and 400 ◦c (fig. 13). these temperatures were selected to identify the microstructural behaviour at 200 ◦c, at which the highest strength increment was observed, and 400 ◦c, at which clear thermally-induced rock mass weakening was observed. a specimen at room temperature was used as a control. based on optical microscope imaging, mineralogical assembling in the granite specimen could be identiﬁed by the colour and texture of each of the mineral assemblages. further, a detailed sem study was performed using scanning electron imaging (sei) and bsei back-scatter electron imaging (bsei) techniques. bsei images taken at low magniﬁcations clearly show different mineral assemblages and grain boundaries (see fig. 14). using energy-dispersive x-ray (edx) technology with aztec oxford instruments, chemical component mapping was generated in each specimen, and each mineral was identiﬁed qualitatively. the bright colour images observed in edx images indicate higher concentration (higher energy dispersion) while dark colour areas indicate lower concentration (lower energy dispersion). based on the spectrum of each point (point id), the corresponding mineral was identiﬁed and a map spectrum provided overall elements available for each specimen. according to figs. 13 and 14, there are clear mineralogical assembling in the granite specimens, mainly with quartz, kfeldspar and plagioclase. the heating of granite up to 200 ◦c temperature has not caused any signiﬁcant thermally-induced micro-cracks (in addition to the pre-existing faults and grain boundaries) and almost all grain boundaries remain intact. however, further heating of granite to the higher temperature of 400 ◦c caused the induction of some micro-cracks, mainly along\\x0cw.g.p.  / geothermics 65 (2017)

however, only a few grain\\x0c56 w.g.p.  / geothermics 65 (2017) 44–59 fig. 13. optical microscopic and sem images of thin sections of strathbogie granite (a) at room temperature; (b) pre-heated to 100 ◦c (c) pre-heated to 400 ◦c. boundaries have been partially parted and a signiﬁcant number of grain boundaries appear to remain intact up to this temperature. furthermore, based on the edx mapping, it was conﬁrmed that intra-granular cracks are mainly initiated along the feldspar and quartz minerals. intragranular cracks were mainly observed in larger crystals (crystals greater than 0.5 mm) and smaller crystals remained un-parted even at 400 ◦c. for strathbogie granite, thermally-induced intra-granular micro-cracks seem to play a signiﬁcant role at relatively low temperatures, probably due to the presence of relatively high k feldspar and biotite contents. similar observations have been reported in bauer and johnson’s (1979) study conducted for charcoal granite, where intra-granular microcracks predominantly occur compared to grain boundary cracks. the sem analysis is also consistent with this ﬁnding, which exhibits inhibition of micro-crack development followed by micro-cracking at relatively high temperatures. the crack propagation process in any rock mass is largely inﬂuenced by the mineralogical composition, because cracks normally propagate through weaker planes of the rock mass. since granite is an igneous type of rock, two main types of thermallyinduced cracking modes can be identiﬁed: inter-granular and intragranular. the amount of inter-granular or intra-granular cracking is dependent on the stress state, rock type and mineralogy of the rock mass. inter-granular cracks occur along grain boundaries, pre-existing faults and micro-cracks of the rock, while intragranular cracks occur through weaker mineralogical constituents (kranz, 1983). for example, k feldspar and biotite are weaker mineralogical constituents due to their large crystals (>10 mm), as crystals greater than 2–3 mm in size are generally deﬁned as weaker mineralogical constituents compared to equi-dimensional small crystals like quartz (homand-etienne and houpert, 1989). based on experimental results, intra-granular cracking is highly temperature-dependent due to the temperature dependent dislocations in the rocks. this is because different mineralogical components have different thermo-elastic moduli and thermal conductivities (kranz, 1983; , 2008). these observations suggest that micro-cracking in granite is highly temperature dependent, as evidenced by the previously observed initial strength gain followed by slight strength reduction with increasing temperature in the tested granite. however, this shows that granite needs to be heated to a sufﬁcient temperature to cause thermal cracks in it and therefore, heating to a lower temperature may only cause a strength gain through the thermal expansion of the rock matrix. this is consistent with the results of bauer and johnson (1979). the mechanical properties of charcoal granite in their study remained relatively steady until 200 ◦c, and westerly granite exhibited a signiﬁcant thermal dependency, even at relatively low temperatures (<200 ◦c). in homand-etienne and houpert (1989) study, the variation of uni-axial compressive strength of both semones and remiremont granites is insigniﬁcant until 400 ◦c, followed by signiﬁcant reductions at higher temperatures. these results indicate the dependency of mineralogical composition and grain size distribution on the temperature dependent mechanical behaviour in various types of granites. however,\\x0cw.g.p.  / geothermics 65 (2017) 44–59 57 fig. 14. bse images of strathbogie granite with edx mapping: (a) thin section at room

30, 60, 90 mpa) and four different temperatures (rt, 100, 200, 300 ◦c), simulating various geothermal reservoir conditions. the following conclusions can be drawn: mechanical behaviour of the tested granite is inﬂuenced by both reservoir depth and temperature, and the depth effect is much greater than the temperature effect. granite located at relatively smaller depths appears to fail through shear localization and increasing depth may cause this to change to ductile failure through strain hardening. a progressive enhancement in stress threshold with increasing conﬁning pressure is observed in strathbogie granite. such behaviours exhibit greater strength and lower brittle characteristics in granite located at greater depths. increasing of temperature causes granite’s strength to be enhanced up to a certain temperature (around 200 ◦c for strathbogie granite) through the possible thermal expansion of the rock matrix and further increasing of temperature may cause it to weaken by inducing thermal cracks. this was conﬁrmed by the micro-structural analysis, which did not reveal any noticeable amount of thermally-induced micro-cracking in strathbogie granite up to 200 ◦c, and heating of the granite to a greater temperature as 400 ◦c caused many intra-granular cracks in quartz and feldspar and some grain boundary cracks between quartz and feldspar minerals. furthermore, according to ae analysis, increasing the temperature ﬁrst causes the crack propagation stress threshold to increase and further increasing of the temperature causes it to be slightly reduced. this indicates a suppression of micro-cracks at low temperatures by matrix expansion and the development of micro-cracks through thermally-induced damage at higher temperatures. finally an attempt was made to improve the conventional mohrcoulomb failure criteria for geothermal reservoirs with extreme pressures and temperatures, because the conventional criteria are not applicable to extreme conditions.

the existing studies described above were conducted on preheated specimens, which really cannot represent the real in-situ ﬁeld situation in geothermal reservoirs. the present study may therefore capture more realistic geothermal reservoir behaviour. 3.6. temperature-dependent failure criteria for strathbogie granite ≤ (3) − is questionable, due to the to date, although many strength criteria are available for intact rock, the practical application of most of them for geothermal reservoirs in-situ model parameters required when considering the available high-pressure and high-temperature environment in underground reservoirs. of the various failure criteria, the mohr-coulomb failure criteria have been extensively used in the ﬁeld and have made a signiﬁcant contribution to the determination of rock mass failure. however, they have some major limitations, including ignoring the intermediate stress (cid:2)2 inﬂuence (which has been proven to have a substantial inﬂuence on rock strength) and the assumed linearity (the strength criteria of rock are non-linear in reality). after re-analyzing thousands of reported triaxial experiments and combining the critical state concept proposed by barton (1976),  (2011) proposed a non-linear mohr-coulomb failure criterion. according to the ﬁndings of  (2011), the mohr-coulomb shear strength parameters should only be obtained by performing conventional tri-axial tests under low conﬁning stresses (in the linear region of the mohr-coulomb failure envelope). according to their statistical analysis, (cid:2)cc ≈ (cid:2)crit, where (cid:2)c and (cid:2) crit are uni-axial compressive strength and critical conﬁning pressure, respectively. the modiﬁed mohr-coulomb failure criterion proposed by  is given below: (cid:2)1 − (cid:2)3 = where, (cid:2)ci ≈ (cid:2)ci + 2sin(cid:3)i0 sin(cid:3)i0 ucs of the rock = 2ciocos(cid:3)i0/1 sin(cid:3)i0, (cid:3)i0 and cio are friction angle and cohesion obtained at low conﬁning

geothermal reservoir rocks at extreme pressures and temperatures, because the strength response is altered by the thermal effect (heuze, 1983). to date, no extensive study has captured this thermal response in the improved mohrcoulomb failure criteria. such a realistic approach is necessary for deep underground engineering applications like geothermal energy extraction. the concepts of barton (1976) and  (2011) are therefore incorporated into the temperature inﬂuence in this study and an attempt is made to propose novel strength criteria for geothermal reservoir rocks based on experimental

, 2008). however, such alterations are also affected by the confinement applying on the rock mass, and confining pressure causes the suppression of thermal cracks and the extension/widening of existing micro-cracks. this results in further alteration of the rock mass mechanical properties, resulting in changing failure modes (mogi, 1966). studies have identified the transition of rock failure mode from brittle to ductile with increasing confinement. however, this transition is diverse due to the different mineralogical compositions and grain boundaries in different rocks (, 2001; wong, 1982). although many studies have been conducted to investigate the temperature-dependent mechanical behaviour of reservoir rocks, most experiments have been conducted in unconfined environments (, 2015; , 2014). pre-heating the specimens to the corresponding temperature ranges and testing at room temperatures has been frequently done (bauer and johnson, 1979; , 2008), but the method is not reliable, as geothermal reservoirs experience continuous thermal stresses. such limitations have occurred mainly due to the limited number of appropriate test facilities available to simulate the stress and temperature conditions of actual geothermal reservoirs. although some studies have analytically and numerically evaluated the mechanical properties of rocks under high temperatures and pressures (chester and higgs, 1992; , 2013; , 2016), to date none has captured the stress-strain behaviour and failure criteria of rocks over a wide range of confining pressures and temperatures, particularly for australian granite. however, the thermo-elastic response and appropriate failure criteria are essential inputs for many engineering applications under high pressures and temperatures, including geothermal extraction applications. this study therefore intends to fill this gap, and it is hoped it will make an important contribution to many deep underground applications. 2. methodology 2.1. tested material granite is an abundant crystalline rock in the earth with medium to coarse grains which was formed as a result of the slow cooling of magma. granite therefore has abundant radioactive elements (k, th, and u). such elements bring elevated geothermal gradients to deep granite reservoirs, which therefore have ideal conditions as geothermal reservoirs. the mineralogical composition of granite mainly consists of quartz, feldspar, plagioclase and biotite, and small amounts of muscovite, amphibole, hornblende and opaque (, 2008). for the present study, samples were collected from the strathbogie batholith, which is a composite granitoid intrusion body spreading over more than 1500 km2 in 150 km north-east from melbourne (). strathbogie granite is a high-level, discordant . sampling location of strathbogie batholith in central victoria.  physical, mechanical and petrographic properties of strathbogie granite (obtained under room temperature and atmospheric pressure conditions). rock type granite colour average grain size petrographic description bulk density (kg/m3) compressive strength (mpa) elastic modulus (gpa) porosity (%) \\u242em white with dark brown 70–600 mainly consists of feldspar, biotite, quartz and plagioclase equigranular, coarse grained, s-type granite 2703.4 118.17 9.09 1.16  results of xrd analysis. mineral id alpha quartz sodic and intermediate plagioclase biotite—phlogopite k-feldspar clinochlore muscovite—sericite dolomite—ankerite other minerals mass% 50 16 15 13 2 2 1 1 granite that mainly consists of quartz, k-feldspar, cordierite and biotite (, 1981). the selected granite type is coarsegrained and white and dark brown in colour with around 1.16% porosity.  presents a close-up view of a typical strathbogie granite sample, an optical microscopic image and an sem image of its thin section. as can be seen in (b), clear mineralogical assembling can be observed in the granite specimen, mainly with quartz, k-feldspar and plagioclase. as shown in , the grain size was measured from a thin section of this granite and found to be \\u242em with only a small number mainly in the range of 0 mm–200 of larger grains (>300 mm) (, 2014).  summarizes the physical, mechanical and petrographic properties of the tested strathbogie granite. in addition, an xrd analysis was conducted to determine the mineralogical composition of the selected granite and the result is shown in . as the table shows, quartz is the predominant mineral in the selected granite (50%), followed by 16% of sodic and intermediate biotite and 15% of plagioclase. the mineralogical composition of this particular granitic composition is representative of the composition of the majority of the earth’s granites (best, 1995). all the physical properties in  and 2\\x0c46 w.g.p.  / geothermics 65 (2017) 44–59 .

(a) dilatancy and failure by strain softening under relatively low confining pressures and (b) failure by strain hardening under elevated confining pressures, and a transitional regime may be observed at intermediate pressures. these transitional failure modes have been referred to as “quasi-brittle”, and complex localized features such as conjugate shear bands can be observed under such conditions (, 2001; , 2004). by visual inspection of the post-failure samples, important information about the alteration of the granite failure mechanism with confining pressures and temperatures can be identified. postfailure images () were therefore collected after each test. according to the post-failure images, specimens that failed at 10–60 mpa confining pressures mainly failed by shear localization along an inclined macroscopic shear band with a single shear zone across each sample. however, samples tested at higher confinements of 90 mpa and 120 mpa (at 100 ◦c) exhibited strain hardening characteristics after achieving the peak stress, and several conjugate shear bands could be observed on the cylindrical sample surface, instead of the single shear band observed earlier. this characteristic was significant at 120 mpa confining pressure. however, it should be noted that only one test was conducted at 120 mpa confinement, because at such high confining pressures the corresponding failure load of granite exceeds the bottom pedestal’s load-bearing capacity. further, a progressive reduction was observed in the failure plane angle with respect to the minor principal stress direction with increasing confining pressure, which implies a reduction in friction angle, possibly due to the greater quasi-brittle behaviour that was shown by granite samples at higher confining pressures (, 2001). 3.2. effect of temperature and confining pressure on mechanical properties of strathbogie granite  illustrates the inﬂuence of temperature on the deviatoric stress of the tested granite under each confinement. as the figure shows, the inﬂuence of confinement is more significant than that of temperature in the temperature range considered here. wong and brace (1979) confirm that at lower confining pressures considerable thermal cracking occurs at relatively low temperatures. if thermal cracking is responsible for the reduction in failure strength, a sharp reduction in deviatoric stress with increasing temperature (with suppression of thermal cracks) should be exhibited under unconfined pressure condition. however, based on the experimental results, under unconfined conditions, up to 100 ◦c, 17.6% of increment in deviatoric stress is followed by 2.5% and 10.5% reductions at 200 ◦c and 300 ◦c, respectively. however, when confinement was applied, strength reduction was initiated after higher temperature of 200 ◦c, mainly due to the inhibition of a thermal cracks by induced compressive force. thermal cracking is therefore an important strength property alteration mechanism in reservoir rocks under certain confining pressure conditions. a clear inﬂuence of temperature on deviatoric stress at any depth or confinement can be observed, and increasing the temperature from room temperature to 200 ◦c causes an increment in deviatoric stress, and further increasing of temperature to 300 ◦c causes a slight reduction in it. this is because the thermal expansion which occurs with increasing temperature causes the reduction of .

which is only 0.19% of maximum measurement. during the load application, the axial strain was measured using linear variable differential transducers (lvdts) attached to the ram of the load cell ((a)). an acoustic emission (ae) system was also employed in the testing of samples to record the data related to the fracturing process. the ae system adopted was a peripheral component interconnection (pci) system with a nominal resolution frequency of 500 khz. during the experiments, two sensors were attached to either side of the loading shaft and with the external amplifiers, which generated low frequency acoustic waves with the fracturing of the sample. in addition, possible micro-structural and mineralogical changes that occurred during thermal and confinement effects were checked using sem analyses. 3. results and discussion 3.1. the overall stress-strain response the inﬂuence of temperature on the stress-strain behaviour of the tested granite was considered first

characteristics were relatively small up to 500 ◦c and beyond that an accelerated downward trend was identified. furthermore, wider localized zones were observed at high temperatures in the post-failure images. however, these studies were conducted at wider temperature ranges (up to 700 ◦c and 900 ◦c, respectively) and the researchers therefore did not pay close attention to reservoir rock behaviour under relatively low geothermal temperature ranges (<300 ◦c). this was the focus of the present study, according to which there is an initial strengthening and stiffening in granite with increasing temperature at low temperatures (up to 200 ◦c), and increasing the temperature beyond a certain value causes a gradual reduction in failure stress with increasing temperature. elastic modulus is an important mechanical property of any reservoir rock, and describes the brittle characteristics of the rock mass. it is therefore often used to evaluate many in-situ stress applications, including wellbore stability, fracturing possibility and tectonic stress distribution (heard and page, 1982). the temperature-dependent brittle properties (elastic modulus) of the tested granite were then evaluated. the elastic region of each stress-strain curve was used to calculate the temperature and pressure-dependent young’s moduli (e) and the results are shown in . the axial strain was measured using lvdts attached to the loading ram with a linearity ±0.1% f.s (full scale) (±0.0075 mm) and infinite resoluerror of tion (no hysteresis). an increment of the modulus of strathbogie granite with increasing temperature up to 200 ◦c can be observed, and further increase of temperature (to 300 ◦c) causes the elastic modulus to be slightly reduced for any confinement. this trend is\\x0ca ‘brittle’ or general increment in elastic modulus with increasing confinement can be observed until 90 mpa, and a further increase of confinement (to 120 mpa) reduces the young’s modulus considerably. with increasing confining stress additional plastic deformation occurs, exhibiting strain-hardening characteristics in granite under high confinements. however, within the range of the experiments conducted (10 mpa–120 mpa) it cannot be definitively identified as a ’ductile’ regime. however, the strain-hardening behaviour observed at 120 mpa indicates transitional characteristics and this can be identified as ‘quasi-brittle’ behaviour (, 2001). the initial young’s modulus reduction with increasing confinement was observed by heard and page (1982), who conducted tests up to 55 mpa confining pressure. however, the latter behaviour was not observed by these researchers. interestingly, according to the research literature, at low temperatures (<200 ◦c) some granite types are more temperature-sensitive, while in contrast, some granites are more temperature-sensitive at high temperatures. the initial strength enhancement is more significant for coarse-grained granites and granodiorite than for fine-grained granites. for example, according to heard and page (1982), stripa granite is more sensitive to temperature at relatively low temperatures (<200 ◦c), and westerly granite is more sensitive to temperature at high temperatures (>200 ◦c). such contradictory behaviours may occur in granite due to the different grain size distributions, grain orientations, mineralogical compositions and heterogeneity of different granite types. this indicates the importance of studying the mineralogical composition and microstructural inﬂuence of granites on such on temperature-dependent strength variations. 3.3. effect of temperature on shear strength parameters of strathbogie granite  illustrates the variation of deviatoric stress of the tested granite with confining pressure for each temperature. the figure shows that increasing confinement causes the granite’s deviatoric stress to increase non-linearly and gradually come to a steady state. this is consistent with similar previous studies, which have clearly shown the enhancement of rock strength with increasing confinement, and the increasing rate is reduced with increasing confining pressure (barton, 2013; , 2011). this is because at low confining pressures there is a high dilation potential. therefore, the ability to open rock micro-cracks is high, resulting in higher friction angles. however, this dilation potential and the corresponding tendency for micro-cracks to open are suppressed with increasing confinement, resulting in lower friction angles at higher confining pressures. therefore, the failure mechanism of the rocks shifts from brittle to ductile with increasing confinement, changing the shape of the mohr-coulomb failure envelope, and according to barton (1976), at critical confining pressure the mohr-coulomb failure envelope reaches a zero gradient. this has also been shown by hoek (1983). the present study has clearly identified this rock behaviour in the mohr-coulomb failure envelopes developed for each temperature condition (refer to ). according to , the traditional linear mohr-coulomb criteria are applicable only in the brittle region of the failure envelope, and at higher confinew.g.p.  / geothermics 65 (2017) 44–59 consistent with the temperature-dependent strength behaviour of the granite described above. the reason for the initial elastic module increment may be that the specimen becomes more brittle at the initial temperature ranges due to thermally-induced volumetric expansion and the associated pore volume reduction. the later slight reduction of young’s modulus with increasing temperature exhibits an enhancement in ductile behaviour (quasi-brittle characteristics) with further increase of temperature. this is possibly due to the increased crack density caused by the induced thermal crack development and the related weakening of the granite. 600 500 400 300 200 100 0 50 σ1-σ3(mpa) 0 100 temperature (ºc) 200

angle and (b) cohesion with different temperatures (considering linear region of the mohr coulomb failure envelope). the latter positive effect of temperature on cohesion, according to wong and brace (1979), increasing the temperature to an extreme value may cause weakening of the grain boundaries, dependent on the anisotropy of the rock matrix (due to potentially existing distinct mineral compounds in granite those may contain different thermo-elastic moduli and this may causes to generate different internal stresses with heating). according to wong and brace (1979), increasing the temperature causes the induction of thermal cracks in the rock mass due to the associated generation of internal stresses (eq. (2)): (2) e(cid:4)˛(cid:4)t = \\u2434 where, e, \\x01␣, \\x01t is the matrix young’s modulus, difference of thermal expansion coefficient of distinct mineral and temperature difference, respectively. when the internal stress (given by eq. (2)) exceeds the crack closure pressure with increasing temperature, thermal cracks form and further increase of temperature provides the surface energy required for the propagation of the initiated crack (, 2007). this results in alteration of the grain-tograin contacts in the rock matrix, which leads to reduced cohesion at higher temperatures. in the case of the variation of friction angle with increasing temperature, the granite friction angle appears to remain steady up to around 100 ◦c (52◦) and then slightly increases with increasing temperature (54◦ at 200 and 300 ◦ c, respectively). the friction between grain-to-grain contacts may be altered by the thermally-induced micro-structural modifications. however, this effect on grain contact is expected to be smaller at relatively low temperatures, resulting in relatively steady friction angle with increasing temperature at lower temperatures. however, a slight ments non-linearity must be taken into account. in addition to the confinement, according to this study, increasing temperature also alters the failure envelope of granite. an initial increment in deviatoric stress with increasing temperature can be observed up to 200 ◦c and further increase of temperature (to 300 ◦c) causes it to be slightly reduced. the temperature-dependent shear parameters of granite were investigated next, and the shear parameters can be obtained from the mohr-coulomb failure envelope. as suggested by  (2011), the mohr-coulomb parameters (cohesion and friction angle) were calculated using eq. (1), taking into account the linear region of the obtained mohr-coulomb failure envelope (considering only smaller confining stresses, up to 30 mpa) for each temperature condition to obtain the temperature-dependent shear strength parameters ().

(continued) enhancement in friction angle with increasing temperature can be seen, probably due to the increased resistance of mineral particles to external deformation as a result of the thermally-induced energy in the mineral particles. however, compared with cohesion, the temperature dependency on friction angle is relatively insignificant within the temperature region considered here. initial enhancement in shear parameters in sandstone with increasing temperature has been observed by  (2015) at relatively low temperature regions, and these researchers observed reduction in friction angle from 33.02◦ to 31.93◦ and an increment a in cohesion from 61.47 mpa to 66.44 mpa with increasing temperature from 25 ◦c to 100 ◦c. further, bauer and johnson (1979) observed around 10% reduction in cohesion and 40% reduction in friction angle in westerly granite with increasing temperature from room temperature to 300 ◦c, and  (1979) observed 7% reduction in cohesion and a 38% reduction in friction angle a with increasing temperature from room temperature to 400 ◦c and 300 ◦c, respectively. however, the variation of shear strength parameters with increasing temperature at relatively low temperatures (<300 ◦c) was not considered in the above studies. the observed initial shear strengthening may be due to the inhibition of micro-crack propagation by the plasticity mechanism which occurs at crack tips (duclos and paquet (1991)) at low temperatures. with further increment of temperature, the reduction of shear strength parameters can be expected, due to the thermal weakening of the rock micro-structure. furthermore, according to the sem studies conducted by  (2007), large local plastic deformations and extremely rough cleavage fractures occur at relatively low temperatures. moreover, due to the volume expansion, the distance between the interfaces of the individual minerals decreases with the enhancement of their mutual attraction, and the strength of the bonds increases (dmitriev, 1972). both of these phenomena can be considered to explain the stress strengthening of granite under relatively low temperatures when subjected to confining pressures. 3.4. analysis of fracturing behaviour using ae technology acoustic emission (ae) detection technology is a powerful nondestructive tool to study crack propagation processes in brittle materials, including the stages of crack initiation, growth and crack damage (lockner, 1993). when a brittle material is under stress, strain energy is released during the development of new cracks or the widening of existing cracks. this energy is released in the form of elastic stress waves from the crack tips, and can be captured and amplified by an ae system. ae detection technology has therefore been widely used in a number of previous studies to understand the crack development mechanism in brittle materials (chang and lee, 2004; , 2000; , 2005). by incorporating the crack propagation pattern into the stressstrain relationship of the cracking material, the crack development process can be divided into several stages. hoek and bieniawski (1965) divided crack formation into five main stages: crack closure, crack initiation, secondary cracking, crack coalescence and crack damage. later,  (2008) and  (2015) incorporated stress-strain curves into cumulative ae counts/energy and strain plots. in the crack propagation process, with the gradual increment of loading on brittle materials, most pre-existing cracks are first closed, releasing an insignificant number of ae counts. this initial crack closure period is followed by the stable crack propagation period, which can be identified by the release of gradual ae energy increments. further increment of loading causes an exponential increase in ae energy, indicating an unstable crack propagation period with failure approaching. the crack closure threshold ((cid:2)cc) is defined as the stress threshold at which the initial ae counts are identified. anan initial increment in cumulative ae\\x0c54 w.g.p.  / geothermics 65 (2017) 44–59 counts can be seen at the crack initiation ((cid:2)ci) threshold, and the cumulative ae counts starts exponential growth at the crack damage ((cid:2)cd) threshold. the region between the crack closure threshold and the crack initiation threshold is generally defined as the stable crack closure region, where linear elastic deformation occurs. the region between the crack initiation threshold and the crack damage threshold is defined as the stable crack propagation region, and the region between the crack damage threshold and sample failure is identified as the unstable crack propagation region. the application of compressive loading fails rocks through either shear localization (brittle regime) or cataclastic ﬂow, and the surrounding conditions, such as temperatures and pressures, may cause a homogenous plastic ﬂow. according to existing studies, axial intra-granular cracking and shear rupturing of cemented grain contacts can be observed before failure in brittle regimes, and grain crushing and pore collapse can be identified before failure in cataclastic ﬂow regimes (, 1996). according to  (1997), the development of local stress concentrations leads to the initiation of many intra-granular micro-cracks in the rock mass, and the crack density increases with increasing deviatoric stress and tends to merge on reaching the peak stress, resulting in strain softening and shear localization. these damage processes are clearly identified by the intense ae activities in the field (chang and lee, 2004). ae technology was therefore used to investigate the progressive fracturing behaviour in strathbogie granite under tri-axial conditions.  illustrates the cumulative ae events with axial stress at various pressures and temperatures for the tested specimens. the corresponding variations of deviatoric stress against strain are also included in the same plots to identify the stress thresholds for crack closure, crack initiation and crack damage (). the very high ae counts in strathbogie granite at dilatancy in the pre-failure stage are due to the fact that ae waves generate when the local shear stress concentration at a grain contact is sufficiently high to rupture the grain boundaries, and frictional slips and grain rotations may occur once the grain contacts have lost their cohesion. in the present study, crack threshold ratios were defined to identify the temperature and pressure-dependent crack propagation in the tested granite as follows, and  shows the crack propagation stress threshold ratios of granite specimens tested at various confining pressures and temperatures. crack closure stress threshold = deviatoric stress at crack closure stress deviatoric stress at failure ((cid:2)cc) crack initiation stress threshold = deviatoric stress at crack initiation stress deviatoric stress at failure ((cid:2)ci) crack damage stress threshold = deviatoric stress at crack damage stress ((cid:2)cd) deviatoric stress at failure according to the results, the beginning of crack damage occurs at earlier stages of deviatoric loading for higher confining pressures. however, the crack damage stress increases with increasing confinement due to the inﬂuence of confining pressure on thermal crack development and the suppression of the extension/widening of existing micro-cracks. according to , in the temperature range considered here, three tendencies can be identified with increasing confining pressure: increase of the elastic deformation region, decrease of the stable crack propagation region, and increase of the unstable crack propagation region. the crack initiation stress threshold also progressively increases with increasing confining pressure, which can be attributed to the fact that the brittle behaviour of rock specimens at lower confining pressures changes to quasi-brittle behaviour with increasing confining pressure. this is because the suppression of micro-crack development is less at low confining pressures, and therefore sudden failures mostly occur, and the beginning of crack initiation occurs at earlier stages of deviatoric loading at high confining pressures due to the higher normal stress acting on micro-cracks, resulting in limited progression of cracking before failure. in relation to the temperature effect, increasing the temperature causes an initial increment in the crack propagation stress threshold, followed by a slight reduction for all the temperature conditions considered. for example, at 30 mpa confinement, the crack damage stress threshold ratios increased by around 6.8%, 10.5% with increasing temperature from room temperature to 100 and 200 ◦c, respectively, and reduced by around 4.0% when the temperature increased to 300 ◦c. this implies that at low temperatures a suppressed micro-crack development mechanism is dominant, and increasing the temperature causes crack damage to occur at earlier loading stages. interestingly, at 60 mpa confinement the crack damage stress threshold ratio increased by around 4.9%, 5.4%, 2.6% with increasing temperature from room to 100, 200 and 300 ◦c, respectively. this exhibits the cumulative effect of temperature and pressure micro-crack development in the rock mass. at relatively low temperatures, micro-crack propagation may be inhibited by the thermally-induced plasticity mechanism which occurs at crack tips and the increased bonding strength through thermally-induced rock matrix expansion (which increases crack stress thresholds). however, further increase of temperature creates thermally-induced cracks and causes the grain boundary cracks to widen, resulting in early crack damage. further, with the inﬂuence of confinement, micro-crack development is suppressed, causing a relatively low increment of crack damage stress threshold ratios at higher confinements. 3.5. corresponding alterations in granite micro-structure a comprehensive micro-structural analysis was also performed to identify the interior correspondences of the above-described temperature-dependent mechanical behaviour of granite. sem and optical microscopic analyses were performed on thin sections of granite specimens at various temperatures: room temperature (20 ◦c), pre-heated (72 hours) to 200 ◦c and 400 ◦c (). these temperatures were selected to identify the microstructural behaviour at 200 ◦c, at which the highest strength increment was observed, and 400 ◦c, at which clear thermally-induced rock mass weakening was observed. a specimen at room temperature was used as a control. based on optical microscope imaging, mineralogical assembling in the granite specimen could be identified by the colour and texture of each of the mineral assemblages. further, a detailed sem study was performed using scanning electron imaging (sei) and bsei back-scatter electron imaging (bsei) techniques. bsei images taken at low magnifications clearly show different mineral assemblages and grain boundaries (see ). using energy-dispersive x-ray (edx) technology with aztec oxford instruments, chemical component mapping was generated in each specimen, and each mineral was identified qualitatively. the bright colour images observed in edx images indicate higher concentration (higher energy dispersion) while dark colour areas indicate lower concentration (lower energy dispersion). based on the spectrum of each point (point id), the corresponding mineral was identified and a map spectrum provided overall elements available for each specimen. according to  and 14, there are clear mineralogical assembling in the granite specimens, mainly with quartz, kfeldspar and plagioclase. the heating of granite up to 200 ◦c temperature has not caused any significant thermally-induced micro-cracks (in addition to the pre-existing faults and grain boundaries) and almost all grain boundaries remain intact. however, further heating of granite to the higher temperature of 400 ◦c caused the induction of some micro-cracks, mainly

quartz feldspar boundaries. however, only a few grain\\x0c56 w.g.p.  / geothermics 65 (2017) 44–59 . optical microscopic and sem images of thin sections of strathbogie granite (a) at room temperature; (b) pre-heated to 100 ◦c (c) pre-heated to 400 ◦c. boundaries have been partially parted and a significant number of grain boundaries appear to remain intact up to this temperature. furthermore, based on the edx mapping, it was confirmed that intra-granular cracks are mainly initiated along the feldspar and quartz minerals. intragranular cracks were mainly observed in larger crystals (crystals greater than 0.5 mm) and smaller crystals remained un-parted even at 400 ◦c. for strathbogie granite, thermally-induced intra-granular micro-cracks seem to play a significant role at relatively low temperatures, probably due to the presence of relatively high k feldspar and biotite contents. similar observations have been reported in bauer and johnson’s (1979) study conducted for charcoal granite, where intra-granular microcracks predominantly occur compared to grain boundary cracks. the sem analysis is also consistent with this finding, which exhibits inhibition of micro-crack development followed by micro-cracking at relatively high temperatures. the crack propagation process in any rock mass is largely inﬂuenced by the mineralogical composition, because cracks normally propagate through weaker planes of the rock mass. since granite is an igneous type of rock, two main types of thermallyinduced cracking modes can be identified: inter-granular and intragranular. the amount of inter-granular or intra-granular cracking is dependent on the stress state, rock type and mineralogy of the rock mass. inter-granular cracks occur along grain boundaries, pre-existing faults and micro-cracks of the rock, while intragranular cracks occur through weaker mineralogical constituents (kranz, 1983). for example, k feldspar and biotite are weaker mineralogical constituents due to their large crystals (>10 mm), as crystals greater than 2–3 mm in size are generally defined as weaker mineralogical constituents compared to equi-dimensional small crystals like quartz (homand-etienne and houpert, 1989). based on experimental results, intra-granular cracking is highly temperature-dependent due to the temperature dependent dislocations in the rocks. this is because different mineralogical components have different thermo-elastic moduli and thermal conductivities (kranz, 1983; , 2008). these observations suggest that micro-cracking in granite is highly temperature dependent, as evidenced by the previously observed initial strength gain followed by slight strength reduction with increasing temperature in the tested granite. however, this shows that granite needs to be heated to a sufficient temperature to cause thermal cracks in it and therefore, heating to a lower temperature may only cause a strength gain through the thermal expansion of the rock matrix. this is consistent with the results of bauer and johnson (1979). the mechanical properties of charcoal granite in their study remained relatively steady until 200 ◦c, and westerly granite exhibited a significant thermal dependency, even at relatively low temperatures (<200 ◦c). in homand-etienne and houpert (1989) study, the variation of uni-axial compressive strength of both semones and remiremont granites is insignificant until 400 ◦c, followed by significant reductions at higher temperatures. these results indicate the dependency of mineralogical composition and grain size distribution on the temperature dependent mechanical behaviour in various types of granites. however,\\x0cw.g.p.  / geothermics 65 (2017) 44–59 57 . bse images of strathbogie granite with edx mapping:

different confining pressures (10, 30, 60, 90 mpa) and four different temperatures (rt, 100, 200, 300 ◦c), simulating various geothermal reservoir conditions. the following conclusions can be drawn: mechanical behaviour of the tested granite is inﬂuenced by both reservoir depth and temperature, and the depth effect is much greater than the temperature effect. granite located at relatively smaller depths appears to fail through shear localization and increasing depth may cause this to change to ductile failure through strain hardening. a progressive enhancement in stress threshold with increasing confining pressure is observed in strathbogie granite. such behaviours exhibit greater strength and lower brittle characteristics in granite located at greater depths. increasing of temperature causes granite’s strength to be enhanced up to a certain temperature (around 200 ◦c for strathbogie granite) through the possible thermal expansion of the rock matrix and further increasing of temperature may cause it to weaken by inducing thermal cracks. this was confirmed by the micro-structural analysis, which did not reveal any noticeable amount of thermally-induced micro-cracking in strathbogie granite up to 200 ◦c, and heating of the granite to a greater temperature as 400 ◦c caused many intra-granular cracks in quartz and feldspar and some grain boundary cracks between quartz and feldspar minerals. furthermore, according to ae analysis, increasing the temperature first causes the crack propagation stress threshold to increase and further increasing of the temperature causes it to be slightly reduced. this indicates a suppression of micro-cracks at low temperatures by matrix expansion and the development of micro-cracks through thermally-induced damage at higher temperatures. finally an attempt was made to improve the conventional mohrcoulomb failure criteria for geothermal reservoirs with extreme pressures and temperatures, because the conventional criteria are not applicable to extreme conditions. acknowledgements this research project is funded by the australian research council (arc dp160104223) and the authors would like to

reservoirs. the present study may therefore capture more realistic geothermal reservoir behaviour. 3.6. temperature-dependent failure criteria for strathbogie granite ≤ (3) − is questionable, due to the to date, although many strength criteria are available for intact rock, the practical application of most of them for geothermal reservoirs in-situ model parameters required when considering the available high-pressure and high-temperature environment in underground reservoirs. of the various failure criteria, the mohr-coulomb failure criteria have been extensively used in the field and have made a significant contribution to the determination of rock mass failure. however, they have some major limitations, including ignoring the intermediate stress (cid:2)2 inﬂuence (which has been proven to have a substantial inﬂuence on rock strength) and the assumed linearity (the strength criteria of rock are non-linear in reality). after re-analyzing thousands of reported triaxial experiments and combining the critical state concept proposed by barton (1976),  (2011) proposed a non-linear mohr-coulomb failure criterion. according to the findings of  (2011), the mohr-coulomb shear strength parameters should only be obtained by performing conventional tri-axial tests under low confining stresses (in the linear region of the mohr-coulomb failure envelope). according to their statistical analysis, (cid:2)cc ≈ (cid:2)crit, where (cid:2)c and (cid:2) crit are uni-axial compressive strength and critical confining pressure, respectively. the modified mohr-coulomb failure criterion proposed by  is given below: (cid:2)1 − (cid:2)3 = where, (cid:2)ci ≈ (cid:2)ci + 2sin(cid:3)i0 sin(cid:3)i0 ucs of the rock = 2ciocos(cid:3)i0/1 sin(cid:3)i0, (cid:3)i0 and cio are friction angle and cohesion obtained at low confining pressures. sin(cid:3)i0) (cid:2)32 2sin(cid:3)i0 (cid:2)3 ≤ (cid:2)3 − (cid:2)crit (1 for 0 (cid:2)crit − − 1 however, even the improved mohr-coulomb failure criteria cannot be directly applied to geothermal reservoir rocks at extreme pressures and temperatures, because the strength response is altered by the thermal effect (heuze, 1983). to date, no extensive study has captured this thermal response in the improved mohrcoulomb failure criteria. such a realistic approach is necessary for deep underground engineering applications like geothermal energy extraction. the concepts of barton (1976) and  (2011) are therefore incorporated into the temperature inﬂuence in this study and an attempt is made to propose novel strength criteria for geothermal reservoir rocks based on experimental data: + 2sin(cid:3)i (t) sin(cid:3)i (t) (cid:2)3 − − 1 − (cid:2)3 (t) = 2ci (t) cos(cid:3)i (t) sin(cid:3)i (t) 1 (cid:2)1 − (4) (cid:2)3 ≤ (cid:2)crit ≤ sin(cid:3)i (t)) (cid:2)32 for 0 − (cid:2)crit (t) (1 2sin(cid:3)i (t) (7) 10−7t 3 × 4.52 0.0002t 2 + − × − × where, (cid:3)i (t) , ci (t) and (cid:2)crit (t) are temperature-dependent friction angle, cohesion and critical confining pressure and can be given as follows: f1 (t) = 1.034 (cid:3)i (t) (cid:3)io ci (t) cio ccrit (t) f2 (t) = 0.7795 0.0001t 2 + 10−8t 3(6) 10−5t 2 −

types of granites under the tested experimental conditions. 58 w.g.p.  / geothermics 65 (2017) 44–59\\x0cw.g.p.  / geothermics 65 (2017) 44–59 59 breede, k., dzebisashvili, k., liu, x., falcone, g.,

axelsson, 2010). exploratory geothermal wells have therefore been drilled to test the availability of geothermal reservoir ∗ corresponding author at: deep earth energy laboratory, department of civil engineering, monash university, building 60, melbourne, victoria 3800, australia. e-mail address:  (p.g. ranjith). http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geothermics.2016.07.002 0375-6505/© 2016 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved. rocks (rocks at elevated temperatures) and deep granite reservoirs have been found to have adequate temperatures to serve as a geothermal reservoirs (, 2013). such explorations involve finding vast blocks of “hot rocks” with fracture systems. such rocks can be used to generate electricity. in this process, water is first injected and circulated through the fractures in the geothermal reservoirs and eventually pumped back to the surface as steam. however, the exploration of geothermal resources has become a challenge to engineers and geologists, due to the high temperature and stress environments in geothermal reservoirs. for this reason, laboratory experiments conducted under high pressure and temperature conditions (geothermal conditions) can assist in providing\\x0cw.g.p.  / geothermics 65 (2017) 44–59 45 basic predictions. a large number of laboratory experiments has therefore been conducted since 1970 to investigate the inﬂuence of high pressure and temperature on rock in relation to geothermal heat extraction (, 2016), deep geological disposal of nuclear waste (paquet and franc¸ ois, 1980), deep mining (wawersik and hannum, 1980) and geological co2 storage (, 2014). the mechanical behaviour of reservoir rocks is significantly inﬂuenced by elevated temperatures, because they cause the micro-structure of the rock mass to be altered through thermal expansion, the development of new micro-cracks, extending and/or widening the existing micro cracks and various mineralogical alterations. rock strength-deformation criteria change with temperature, and some rock mechanical properties, such as compressive strength, tensile strength, elastic modulus, cohesive strength and friction angle, decrease with increasing temperature (heuze, 1983; , 2008). however, such alterations are also affected by the confinement applying on the rock mass, and confining pressure causes the suppression of thermal cracks and the extension/widening of existing micro-cracks. this results in further alteration of the rock mass mechanical properties, resulting in changing failure modes (mogi, 1966). studies have identified the transition of rock failure mode from brittle to ductile with increasing confinement. however, this transition is diverse due to the different mineralogical compositions and grain boundaries in different rocks (, 2001; wong, 1982). although many studies have been conducted to investigate the temperature-dependent mechanical behaviour of reservoir rocks, most experiments have been conducted in unconfined environments (, 2015; , 2014). pre-heating the specimens to the corresponding temperature ranges and testing at room temperatures has been frequently done (bauer and johnson, 1979; , 2008), but the method is not reliable, as geothermal reservoirs experience continuous thermal stresses. such limitations have occurred mainly due to the limited number of appropriate test facilities available to simulate the stress and temperature conditions of actual geothermal reservoirs. although some studies have analytically and numerically evaluated the mechanical properties of rocks under high temperatures and pressures (chester and higgs, 1992; , 2013; , 2016), to date none has captured the stress-strain behaviour and failure criteria of rocks over a wide range of confining pressures and temperatures, particularly for australian granite. however, the thermo-elastic response and appropriate failure criteria are essential inputs for many engineering applications under high pressures and temperatures, including geothermal extraction applications. this study therefore intends to fill this gap, and it is hoped it will make an important contribution to many deep underground applications. 2. methodology 2.1. tested material granite is an abundant crystalline rock in the earth with medium to coarse grains which was formed as a result of the slow cooling of magma. granite therefore has abundant radioactive elements (k, th, and u). such elements bring elevated geothermal gradients to deep granite reservoirs, which therefore have ideal conditions as geothermal reservoirs. the mineralogical composition of granite mainly consists of quartz, feldspar, plagioclase and biotite, and small amounts of muscovite, amphibole, hornblende and opaque (, 2008). for the present study, samples were collected from the strathbogie batholith, which is a composite granitoid intrusion body spreading over more than 1500 km2 in 150 km north-east from melbourne (). strathbogie granite is a high-level, discordant . sampling location of strathbogie batholith in central victoria.  physical, mechanical and petrographic properties of strathbogie granite (obtained under room temperature and atmospheric pressure conditions). rock type granite colour average grain size petrographic description bulk density (kg/m3) compressive strength (mpa) elastic modulus (gpa) porosity (%) \\u242em white with dark brown 70–600 mainly consists of feldspar, biotite, quartz and plagioclase equigranular, coarse grained, s-type granite 2703.4 118.17 9.09 1.16  results of xrd analysis. mineral id alpha quartz sodic and intermediate plagioclase biotite—phlogopite k-feldspar clinochlore muscovite—sericite dolomite—ankerite other minerals mass% 50 16 15 13 2 2 1 1 granite that mainly consists of quartz, k-feldspar, cordierite and biotite (, 1981). the selected granite type is coarsegrained and white and dark brown in colour with around 1.16% porosity.  presents a close-up view of a typical strathbogie granite sample, an optical microscopic image and an sem image of its thin section. as can be seen in (b), clear mineralogical assembling can be observed in the granite specimen, mainly with quartz, k-feldspar and plagioclase. as shown in , the grain size was measured from a thin section of this granite and found to be \\u242em with only a small number mainly in the range of 0 mm–200 of larger grains (>300 mm) (, 2014).  summarizes the physical, mechanical and petrographic properties of the tested strathbogie granite. in addition, an xrd analysis was conducted to determine the mineralogical composition of the selected granite and the result is shown in . as the table shows, quartz is the predominant mineral in the selected granite (50%), followed by 16% of sodic and intermediate biotite and 15% of plagioclase. the mineralogical composition of this particular granitic composition is representative of the composition of the majority of the earth’s granites (best, 1995). all the physical properties in  and 2\\x0c46 w.g.p.  / geothermics 65 (2017) 44–59 .

(a) dilatancy and failure by strain softening under relatively low confining pressures and (b) failure by strain hardening under elevated confining pressures, and a transitional regime may be observed at intermediate pressures. these transitional failure modes have been referred to as “quasi-brittle”, and complex localized features such as conjugate shear bands can be observed under such conditions (, 2001; , 2004). by visual inspection of the post-failure samples, important information about the alteration of the granite failure mechanism with confining pressures and temperatures can be identified. postfailure images () were therefore collected after each test. according to the post-failure images, specimens that failed at 10–60 mpa confining pressures mainly failed by shear localization along an inclined macroscopic shear band with a single shear zone across each sample. however, samples tested at higher confinements of 90 mpa and 120 mpa (at 100 ◦c) exhibited strain hardening characteristics after achieving the peak stress, and several conjugate shear bands could be observed on the cylindrical sample surface, instead of the single shear band observed earlier. this characteristic was significant at 120 mpa confining pressure. however, it should be noted that only one test was conducted at 120 mpa confinement, because at such high confining pressures the corresponding failure load of granite exceeds the bottom pedestal’s load-bearing capacity. further, a progressive reduction was observed in the failure plane angle with respect to the minor principal stress direction with increasing confining pressure, which implies a reduction in friction angle, possibly due to the greater quasi-brittle behaviour that was shown by granite samples at higher confining pressures (, 2001). 3.2. effect of temperature and confining pressure on mechanical properties of strathbogie granite  illustrates the inﬂuence of temperature on the deviatoric stress of the tested granite under each confinement. as the figure shows, the inﬂuence of confinement is more significant than that of temperature in the temperature range considered here. wong and brace (1979) confirm that at lower confining pressures considerable thermal cracking occurs at relatively low temperatures. if thermal cracking is responsible for the reduction in failure strength, a sharp reduction in deviatoric stress with increasing temperature (with suppression of thermal cracks) should be exhibited under unconfined pressure condition. however, based on the experimental results, under unconfined conditions, up to 100 ◦c, 17.6% of increment in deviatoric stress is followed by 2.5% and 10.5% reductions at 200 ◦c and 300 ◦c, respectively. however, when confinement was applied, strength reduction was initiated after higher temperature of 200 ◦c, mainly due to the inhibition of a thermal cracks by induced compressive force. thermal cracking is therefore an important strength property alteration mechanism in reservoir rocks under certain confining pressure conditions. a clear inﬂuence of temperature on deviatoric stress at any depth or confinement can be observed, and increasing the temperature from room temperature to 200 ◦c causes an increment in deviatoric stress, and further increasing of temperature to 300 ◦c causes a slight reduction in it. this is because the thermal expansion which occurs with increasing temperature causes the reduction of .

which is only 0.19% of maximum measurement. during the load application, the axial strain was measured using linear variable differential transducers (lvdts) attached to the ram of the load cell ((a)). an acoustic emission (ae) system was also employed in the testing of samples to record the data related to the fracturing process. the ae system adopted was a peripheral component interconnection (pci) system with a nominal resolution frequency of 500 khz. during the experiments, two sensors were attached to either side of the loading shaft and with the external amplifiers, which generated low frequency acoustic waves with the fracturing of the sample. in addition, possible micro-structural and mineralogical changes that occurred during thermal and confinement effects were checked using sem analyses. 3. results and discussion 3.1. the overall stress-strain response the inﬂuence of temperature on the stress-strain behaviour of the tested granite was considered first

characteristics were relatively small up to 500 ◦c and beyond that an accelerated downward trend was identified. furthermore, wider localized zones were observed at high temperatures in the post-failure images. however, these studies were conducted at wider temperature ranges (up to 700 ◦c and 900 ◦c, respectively) and the researchers therefore did not pay close attention to reservoir rock behaviour under relatively low geothermal temperature ranges (<300 ◦c). this was the focus of the present study, according to which there is an initial strengthening and stiffening in granite with increasing temperature at low temperatures (up to 200 ◦c), and increasing the temperature beyond a certain value causes a gradual reduction in failure stress with increasing temperature. elastic modulus is an important mechanical property of any reservoir rock, and describes the brittle characteristics of the rock mass. it is therefore often used to evaluate many in-situ stress applications, including wellbore stability, fracturing possibility and tectonic stress distribution (heard and page, 1982). the temperature-dependent brittle properties (elastic modulus) of the tested granite were then evaluated. the elastic region of each stress-strain curve was used to calculate the temperature and pressure-dependent young’s moduli (e) and the results are shown in . the axial strain was measured using lvdts attached to the loading ram with a linearity ±0.1% f.s (full scale) (±0.0075 mm) and infinite resoluerror of tion (no hysteresis). an increment of the modulus of strathbogie granite with increasing temperature up to 200 ◦c can be observed, and further increase of temperature (to 300 ◦c) causes the elastic modulus to be slightly reduced for any confinement. this trend is\\x0ca ‘brittle’ or general increment in elastic modulus with increasing confinement can be observed until 90 mpa, and a further increase of confinement (to 120 mpa) reduces the young’s modulus considerably. with increasing confining stress additional plastic deformation occurs, exhibiting strain-hardening characteristics in granite under high confinements. however, within the range of the experiments conducted (10 mpa–120 mpa) it cannot be definitively identified as a ’ductile’ regime. however, the strain-hardening behaviour observed at 120 mpa indicates transitional characteristics and this can be identified as ‘quasi-brittle’ behaviour (, 2001). the initial young’s modulus reduction with increasing confinement was observed by heard and page (1982), who conducted tests up to 55 mpa confining pressure. however, the latter behaviour was not observed by these researchers. interestingly, according to the research literature, at low temperatures (<200 ◦c) some granite types are more temperature-sensitive, while in contrast, some granites are more temperature-sensitive at high temperatures. the initial strength enhancement is more significant for coarse-grained granites and granodiorite than for fine-grained granites. for example, according to heard and page (1982), stripa granite is more sensitive to temperature at relatively low temperatures (<200 ◦c), and westerly granite is more sensitive to temperature at high temperatures (>200 ◦c). such contradictory behaviours may occur in granite due to the different grain size distributions, grain orientations, mineralogical compositions and heterogeneity of different granite types. this indicates the importance of studying the mineralogical composition and microstructural inﬂuence of granites on such on temperature-dependent strength variations. 3.3. effect of temperature on shear strength parameters of strathbogie granite  illustrates the variation of deviatoric stress of the tested granite with confining pressure for each temperature. the figure shows that increasing confinement causes the granite’s deviatoric stress to increase non-linearly and gradually come to a steady state. this is consistent with similar previous studies, which have clearly shown the enhancement of rock strength with increasing confinement, and the increasing rate is reduced with increasing confining pressure (barton, 2013; , 2011). this is because at low confining pressures there is a high dilation potential. therefore, the ability to open rock micro-cracks is high, resulting in higher friction angles. however, this dilation potential and the corresponding tendency for micro-cracks to open are suppressed with increasing confinement, resulting in lower friction angles at higher confining pressures. therefore, the failure mechanism of the rocks shifts from brittle to ductile with increasing confinement, changing the shape of the mohr-coulomb failure envelope, and according to barton (1976), at critical confining pressure the mohr-coulomb failure envelope reaches a zero gradient. this has also been shown by hoek (1983). the present study has clearly identified this rock behaviour in the mohr-coulomb failure envelopes developed for each temperature condition (refer to ). according to , the traditional linear mohr-coulomb criteria are applicable only in the brittle region of the failure envelope, and at higher confinew.g.p.  / geothermics 65 (2017) 44–59 consistent with the temperature-dependent strength behaviour of the granite described above. the reason for the initial elastic module increment may be that the specimen becomes more brittle at the initial temperature ranges due to thermally-induced volumetric expansion and the associated pore volume reduction. the later slight reduction of young’s modulus with increasing temperature exhibits an enhancement in ductile behaviour (quasi-brittle characteristics) with further increase of temperature. this is possibly due to the increased crack density caused by the induced thermal crack development and the related weakening of the granite. 600 500 400 300 200 100 0 50 σ1-σ3(mpa) 0 100 temperature (ºc) 200

angle and (b) cohesion with different temperatures (considering linear region of the mohr coulomb failure envelope). the latter positive effect of temperature on cohesion, according to wong and brace (1979), increasing the temperature to an extreme value may cause weakening of the grain boundaries, dependent on the anisotropy of the rock matrix (due to potentially existing distinct mineral compounds in granite those may contain different thermo-elastic moduli and this may causes to generate different internal stresses with heating). according to wong and brace (1979), increasing the temperature causes the induction of thermal cracks in the rock mass due to the associated generation of internal stresses (eq. (2)): (2) e(cid:4)˛(cid:4)t = \\u2434 where, e, \\x01␣, \\x01t is the matrix young’s modulus, difference of thermal expansion coefficient of distinct mineral and temperature difference, respectively. when the internal stress (given by eq. (2)) exceeds the crack closure pressure with increasing temperature, thermal cracks form and further increase of temperature provides the surface energy required for the propagation of the initiated crack (, 2007). this results in alteration of the grain-tograin contacts in the rock matrix, which leads to reduced cohesion at higher temperatures. in the case of the variation of friction angle with increasing temperature, the granite friction angle appears to remain steady up to around 100 ◦c (52◦) and then slightly increases with increasing temperature (54◦ at 200 and 300 ◦ c, respectively). the friction between grain-to-grain contacts may be altered by the thermally-induced micro-structural modifications. however, this effect on grain contact is expected to be smaller at relatively low temperatures, resulting in relatively steady friction angle with increasing temperature at lower temperatures. however, a slight ments non-linearity must be taken into account. in addition to the confinement, according to this study, increasing temperature also alters the failure envelope of granite. an initial increment in deviatoric stress with increasing temperature can be observed up to 200 ◦c and further increase of temperature (to 300 ◦c) causes it to be slightly reduced. the temperature-dependent shear parameters of granite were investigated next, and the shear parameters can be obtained from the mohr-coulomb failure envelope. as suggested by  (2011), the mohr-coulomb parameters (cohesion and friction angle) were calculated using eq. (1), taking into account the linear region of the obtained mohr-coulomb failure envelope (considering only smaller confining stresses, up to 30 mpa) for each temperature condition to obtain the temperature-dependent shear strength parameters ().

(continued) enhancement in friction angle with increasing temperature can be seen, probably due to the increased resistance of mineral particles to external deformation as a result of the thermally-induced energy in the mineral particles. however, compared with cohesion, the temperature dependency on friction angle is relatively insignificant within the temperature region considered here. initial enhancement in shear parameters in sandstone with increasing temperature has been observed by  (2015) at relatively low temperature regions, and these researchers observed reduction in friction angle from 33.02◦ to 31.93◦ and an increment a in cohesion from 61.47 mpa to 66.44 mpa with increasing temperature from 25 ◦c to 100 ◦c. further, bauer and johnson (1979) observed around 10% reduction in cohesion and 40% reduction in friction angle in westerly granite with increasing temperature from room temperature to 300 ◦c, and  (1979) observed 7% reduction in cohesion and a 38% reduction in friction angle a with increasing temperature from room temperature to 400 ◦c and 300 ◦c, respectively. however, the variation of shear strength parameters with increasing temperature at relatively low temperatures (<300 ◦c) was not considered in the above studies. the observed initial shear strengthening may be due to the inhibition of micro-crack propagation by the plasticity mechanism which occurs at crack tips (duclos and paquet (1991)) at low temperatures. with further increment of temperature, the reduction of shear strength parameters can be expected, due to the thermal weakening of the rock micro-structure. furthermore, according to the sem studies conducted by  (2007), large local plastic deformations and extremely rough cleavage fractures occur at relatively low temperatures. moreover, due to the volume expansion, the distance between the interfaces of the individual minerals decreases with the enhancement of their mutual attraction, and the strength of the bonds increases (dmitriev, 1972). both of these phenomena can be considered to explain the stress strengthening of granite under relatively low temperatures when subjected to confining pressures. 3.4. analysis of fracturing behaviour using ae technology acoustic emission (ae) detection technology is a powerful nondestructive tool to study crack propagation processes in brittle materials, including the stages of crack initiation, growth and crack damage (lockner, 1993). when a brittle material is under stress, strain energy is released during the development of new cracks or the widening of existing cracks. this energy is released in the form of elastic stress waves from the crack tips, and can be captured and amplified by an ae system. ae detection technology has therefore been widely used in a number of previous studies to understand the crack development mechanism in brittle materials (chang and lee, 2004; , 2000; , 2005). by incorporating the crack propagation pattern into the stressstrain relationship of the cracking material, the crack development process can be divided into several stages. hoek and bieniawski (1965) divided crack formation into five main stages: crack closure, crack initiation, secondary cracking, crack coalescence and crack damage. later,  (2008) and  (2015) incorporated stress-strain curves into cumulative ae counts/energy and strain plots. in the crack propagation process, with the gradual increment of loading on brittle materials, most pre-existing cracks are first closed, releasing an insignificant number of ae counts. this initial crack closure period is followed by the stable crack propagation period, which can be identified by the release of gradual ae energy increments. further increment of loading causes an exponential increase in ae energy, indicating an unstable crack propagation period with failure approaching. the crack closure threshold ((cid:2)cc) is defined as the stress threshold at which the initial ae counts are identified. anan initial increment in cumulative ae\\x0c54 w.g.p.  / geothermics 65 (2017) 44–59 counts can be seen at the crack initiation ((cid:2)ci) threshold, and the cumulative ae counts starts exponential growth at the crack damage ((cid:2)cd) threshold. the region between the crack closure threshold and the crack initiation threshold is generally defined as the stable crack closure region, where linear elastic deformation occurs. the region between the crack initiation threshold and the crack damage threshold is defined as the stable crack propagation region, and the region between the crack damage threshold and sample failure is identified as the unstable crack propagation region. the application of compressive loading fails rocks through either shear localization (brittle regime) or cataclastic ﬂow, and the surrounding conditions, such as temperatures and pressures, may cause a homogenous plastic ﬂow. according to existing studies, axial intra-granular cracking and shear rupturing of cemented grain contacts can be observed before failure in brittle regimes, and grain crushing and pore collapse can be identified before failure in cataclastic ﬂow regimes (, 1996). according to  (1997), the development of local stress concentrations leads to the initiation of many intra-granular micro-cracks in the rock mass, and the crack density increases with increasing deviatoric stress and tends to merge on reaching the peak stress, resulting in strain softening and shear localization. these damage processes are clearly identified by the intense ae activities in the field (chang and lee, 2004). ae technology was therefore used to investigate the progressive fracturing behaviour in strathbogie granite under tri-axial conditions.  illustrates the cumulative ae events with axial stress at various pressures and temperatures for the tested specimens. the corresponding variations of deviatoric stress against strain are also included in the same plots to identify the stress thresholds for crack closure, crack initiation and crack damage (). the very high ae counts in strathbogie granite at dilatancy in the pre-failure stage are due to the fact that ae waves generate when the local shear stress concentration at a grain contact is sufficiently high to rupture the grain boundaries, and frictional slips and grain rotations may occur once the grain contacts have lost their cohesion. in the present study, crack threshold ratios were defined to identify the temperature and pressure-dependent crack propagation in the tested granite as follows, and  shows the crack propagation stress threshold ratios of granite specimens tested at various confining pressures and temperatures. crack closure stress threshold = deviatoric stress at crack closure stress deviatoric stress at failure ((cid:2)cc) crack initiation stress threshold = deviatoric stress at crack initiation stress deviatoric stress at failure ((cid:2)ci) crack damage stress threshold = deviatoric stress at crack damage stress ((cid:2)cd) deviatoric stress at failure according to the results, the beginning of crack damage occurs at earlier stages of deviatoric loading for higher confining pressures. however, the crack damage stress increases with increasing confinement due to the inﬂuence of confining pressure on thermal crack development and the suppression of the extension/widening of existing micro-cracks. according to , in the temperature range considered here, three tendencies can be identified with increasing confining pressure: increase of the elastic deformation region, decrease of the stable crack propagation region, and increase of the unstable crack propagation region. the crack initiation stress threshold also progressively increases with increasing confining pressure, which can be attributed to the fact that the brittle behaviour of rock specimens at lower confining pressures changes to quasi-brittle behaviour with increasing confining pressure. this is because the suppression of micro-crack development is less at low confining pressures, and therefore sudden failures mostly occur, and the beginning of crack initiation occurs at earlier stages of deviatoric loading at high confining pressures due to the higher normal stress acting on micro-cracks, resulting in limited progression of cracking before failure. in relation to the temperature effect, increasing the temperature causes an initial increment in the crack propagation stress threshold, followed by a slight reduction for all the temperature conditions considered. for example, at 30 mpa confinement, the crack damage stress threshold ratios increased by around 6.8%, 10.5% with increasing temperature from room temperature to 100 and 200 ◦c, respectively, and reduced by around 4.0% when the temperature increased to 300 ◦c. this implies that at low temperatures a suppressed micro-crack development mechanism is dominant, and increasing the temperature causes crack damage to occur at earlier loading stages. interestingly, at 60 mpa confinement the crack damage stress threshold ratio increased by around 4.9%, 5.4%, 2.6% with increasing temperature from room to 100, 200 and 300 ◦c, respectively. this exhibits the cumulative effect of temperature and pressure micro-crack development in the rock mass. at relatively low temperatures, micro-crack propagation may be inhibited by the thermally-induced plasticity mechanism which occurs at crack tips and the increased bonding strength through thermally-induced rock matrix expansion (which increases crack stress thresholds). however, further increase of temperature creates thermally-induced cracks and causes the grain boundary cracks to widen, resulting in early crack damage. further, with the inﬂuence of confinement, micro-crack development is suppressed, causing a relatively low increment of crack damage stress threshold ratios at higher confinements. 3.5. corresponding alterations in granite micro-structure a comprehensive micro-structural analysis was also performed to identify the interior correspondences of the above-described temperature-dependent mechanical behaviour of granite. sem and optical microscopic analyses were performed on thin sections of granite specimens at various temperatures: room temperature (20 ◦c), pre-heated (72 hours) to 200 ◦c and 400 ◦c (). these temperatures were selected to identify the microstructural behaviour at 200 ◦c, at which the highest strength increment was observed, and 400 ◦c, at which clear thermally-induced rock mass weakening was observed. a specimen at room temperature was used as a control. based on optical microscope imaging, mineralogical assembling in the granite specimen could be identified by the colour and texture of each of the mineral assemblages. further, a detailed sem study was performed using scanning electron imaging (sei) and bsei back-scatter electron imaging (bsei) techniques. bsei images taken at low magnifications clearly show different mineral assemblages and grain boundaries (see ). using energy-dispersive x-ray (edx) technology with aztec oxford instruments, chemical component mapping was generated in each specimen, and each mineral was identified qualitatively. the bright colour images observed in edx images indicate higher concentration (higher energy dispersion) while dark colour areas indicate lower concentration (lower energy dispersion). based on the spectrum of each point (point id), the corresponding mineral was identified and a map spectrum provided overall elements available for each specimen. according to  and 14, there are clear mineralogical assembling in the granite specimens, mainly with quartz, kfeldspar and plagioclase. the heating of granite up to 200 ◦c temperature has not caused any significant thermally-induced micro-cracks (in addition to the pre-existing faults and grain boundaries) and almost all grain boundaries remain intact. however, further heating of granite to the higher temperature of 400 ◦c caused the induction of some micro-cracks, mainly

quartz feldspar boundaries. however, only a few grain\\x0c56 w.g.p.  / geothermics 65 (2017) 44–59 . optical microscopic and sem images of thin sections of strathbogie granite (a) at room temperature; (b) pre-heated to 100 ◦c (c) pre-heated to 400 ◦c. boundaries have been partially parted and a significant number of grain boundaries appear to remain intact up to this temperature. furthermore, based on the edx mapping, it was confirmed that intra-granular cracks are mainly initiated along the feldspar and quartz minerals. intragranular cracks were mainly observed in larger crystals (crystals greater than 0.5 mm) and smaller crystals remained un-parted even at 400 ◦c. for strathbogie granite, thermally-induced intra-granular micro-cracks seem to play a significant role at relatively low temperatures, probably due to the presence of relatively high k feldspar and biotite contents. similar observations have been reported in bauer and johnson’s (1979) study conducted for charcoal granite, where intra-granular microcracks predominantly occur compared to grain boundary cracks. the sem analysis is also consistent with this finding, which exhibits inhibition of micro-crack development followed by micro-cracking at relatively high temperatures. the crack propagation process in any rock mass is largely inﬂuenced by the mineralogical composition, because cracks normally propagate through weaker planes of the rock mass. since granite is an igneous type of rock, two main types of thermallyinduced cracking modes can be identified: inter-granular and intragranular. the amount of inter-granular or intra-granular cracking is dependent on the stress state, rock type and mineralogy of the rock mass. inter-granular cracks occur along grain boundaries, pre-existing faults and micro-cracks of the rock, while intragranular cracks occur through weaker mineralogical constituents (kranz, 1983). for example, k feldspar and biotite are weaker mineralogical constituents due to their large crystals (>10 mm), as crystals greater than 2–3 mm in size are generally defined as weaker mineralogical constituents compared to equi-dimensional small crystals like quartz (homand-etienne and houpert, 1989). based on experimental results, intra-granular cracking is highly temperature-dependent due to the temperature dependent dislocations in the rocks. this is because different mineralogical components have different thermo-elastic moduli and thermal conductivities (kranz, 1983; , 2008). these observations suggest that micro-cracking in granite is highly temperature dependent, as evidenced by the previously observed initial strength gain followed by slight strength reduction with increasing temperature in the tested granite. however, this shows that granite needs to be heated to a sufficient temperature to cause thermal cracks in it and therefore, heating to a lower temperature may only cause a strength gain through the thermal expansion of the rock matrix. this is consistent with the results of bauer and johnson (1979). the mechanical properties of charcoal granite in their study remained relatively steady until 200 ◦c, and westerly granite exhibited a significant thermal dependency, even at relatively low temperatures (<200 ◦c). in homand-etienne and houpert (1989) study, the variation of uni-axial compressive strength of both semones and remiremont granites is insignificant until 400 ◦c, followed by significant reductions at higher temperatures. these results indicate the dependency of mineralogical composition and grain size distribution on the temperature dependent mechanical behaviour in various types of granites. however,\\x0cw.g.p.  / geothermics 65 (2017) 44–59 57 . bse images of strathbogie granite with edx mapping:

different confining pressures (10, 30, 60, 90 mpa) and four different temperatures (rt, 100, 200, 300 ◦c), simulating various geothermal reservoir conditions. the following conclusions can be drawn: mechanical behaviour of the tested granite is inﬂuenced by both reservoir depth and temperature, and the depth effect is much greater than the temperature effect. granite located at relatively smaller depths appears to fail through shear localization and increasing depth may cause this to change to ductile failure through strain hardening. a progressive enhancement in stress threshold with increasing confining pressure is observed in strathbogie granite. such behaviours exhibit greater strength and lower brittle characteristics in granite located at greater depths. increasing of temperature causes granite’s strength to be enhanced up to a certain temperature (around 200 ◦c for strathbogie granite) through the possible thermal expansion of the rock matrix and further increasing of temperature may cause it to weaken by inducing thermal cracks. this was confirmed by the micro-structural analysis, which did not reveal any noticeable amount of thermally-induced micro-cracking in strathbogie granite up to 200 ◦c, and heating of the granite to a greater temperature as 400 ◦c caused many intra-granular cracks in quartz and feldspar and some grain boundary cracks between quartz and feldspar minerals. furthermore, according to ae analysis, increasing the temperature first causes the crack propagation stress threshold to increase and further increasing of the temperature causes it to be slightly reduced. this indicates a suppression of micro-cracks at low temperatures by matrix expansion and the development of micro-cracks through thermally-induced damage at higher temperatures. finally an attempt was made to improve the conventional mohrcoulomb failure criteria for geothermal reservoirs with extreme pressures and temperatures, because the conventional criteria are not applicable to extreme conditions. acknowledgements this research project is funded by the australian research council (arc dp160104223) and the authors would like to

reservoirs. the present study may therefore capture more realistic geothermal reservoir behaviour. 3.6. temperature-dependent failure criteria for strathbogie granite ≤ (3) − is questionable, due to the to date, although many strength criteria are available for intact rock, the practical application of most of them for geothermal reservoirs in-situ model parameters required when considering the available high-pressure and high-temperature environment in underground reservoirs. of the various failure criteria, the mohr-coulomb failure criteria have been extensively used in the field and have made a significant contribution to the determination of rock mass failure. however, they have some major limitations, including ignoring the intermediate stress (cid:2)2 inﬂuence (which has been proven to have a substantial inﬂuence on rock strength) and the assumed linearity (the strength criteria of rock are non-linear in reality). after re-analyzing thousands of reported triaxial experiments and combining the critical state concept proposed by barton (1976),  (2011) proposed a non-linear mohr-coulomb failure criterion. according to the findings of  (2011), the mohr-coulomb shear strength parameters should only be obtained by performing conventional tri-axial tests under low confining stresses (in the linear region of the mohr-coulomb failure envelope). according to their statistical analysis, (cid:2)cc ≈ (cid:2)crit, where (cid:2)c and (cid:2) crit are uni-axial compressive strength and critical confining pressure, respectively. the modified mohr-coulomb failure criterion proposed by  is given below: (cid:2)1 − (cid:2)3 = where, (cid:2)ci ≈ (cid:2)ci + 2sin(cid:3)i0 sin(cid:3)i0 ucs of the rock = 2ciocos(cid:3)i0/1 sin(cid:3)i0, (cid:3)i0 and cio are friction

failure criteria cannot be directly applied to geothermal reservoir rocks at extreme pressures and temperatures, because the strength response is altered by the thermal effect (heuze, 1983). to date, no extensive study has captured this thermal response in the improved mohrcoulomb failure criteria. such a realistic approach is necessary for deep underground engineering applications like geothermal energy extraction. the concepts of barton (1976) and  (2011) are therefore incorporated into the temperature inﬂuence in this study and an attempt is made to propose novel strength criteria for geothermal reservoir rocks based on experimental data: + 2sin(cid:3)i (t) sin(cid:3)i (t) (cid:2)3 − − 1 − (cid:2)3 (t) = 2ci (t) cos(cid:3)i (t) sin(cid:3)i (t) 1 (cid:2)1 − (4) (cid:2)3 ≤

axelsson, 2010). exploratory geothermal wells have therefore been drilled to test the availability of geothermal reservoir ∗ corresponding author at: deep earth energy laboratory, department of civil engineering, monash university, building 60, melbourne, victoria 3800, australia. e-mail address:  (p.g. ranjith).  0375-6505/© 2016 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved. rocks (rocks at elevated temperatures) and deep granite reservoirs have been found to have adequate temperatures to serve as a geothermal reservoirs (, 2013). such explorations involve finding vast blocks of “hot rocks” with fracture systems. such rocks can be used to generate electricity. in this process, water is first injected and circulated through the fractures in the geothermal reservoirs and eventually pumped back to the surface as steam. however, the exploration of geothermal resources has become a challenge to engineers and geologists, due to the high temperature and stress environments in geothermal reservoirs. for this reason, laboratory experiments conducted under high pressure and temperature conditions (geothermal conditions) can assist in providing\\x0cw.g.p.  / geothermics 65 (2017) 44–59 45 basic predictions. a large number of laboratory experiments has therefore been conducted since 1970 to investigate the inﬂuence of high pressure and temperature on rock in relation to geothermal heat extraction (, 2016), deep geological disposal of nuclear waste (paquet and franc¸ ois, 1980), deep mining (wawersik and hannum, 1980) and geological co2 storage (, 2014). the mechanical behaviour of reservoir rocks is significantly inﬂuenced by elevated temperatures, because they cause the micro-structure of the rock mass to be altered through thermal expansion, the development of new micro-cracks, extending and/or widening the existing micro cracks and various mineralogical alterations. rock strength-deformation criteria change with temperature, and some rock mechanical properties, such as compressive strength, tensile strength, elastic modulus, cohesive strength and friction angle, decrease with increasing temperature (heuze, 1983; , 2008). however, such alterations are also affected by the confinement applying on the rock mass, and confining pressure causes the suppression of thermal cracks and the extension/widening of existing micro-cracks. this results in further alteration of the rock mass mechanical properties, resulting in changing failure modes (mogi, 1966). studies have identified the transition of rock failure mode from brittle to ductile with increasing confinement. however, this transition is diverse due to the different mineralogical compositions and grain boundaries in different rocks (, 2001; wong, 1982). although many studies have been conducted to investigate the temperature-dependent mechanical behaviour of reservoir rocks, most experiments have been conducted in unconfined environments (, 2015; , 2014). pre-heating the specimens to the corresponding temperature ranges and testing at room temperatures has been frequently done (bauer and johnson, 1979; , 2008), but the method is not reliable, as geothermal reservoirs experience continuous thermal stresses. such limitations have occurred mainly due to the limited number of appropriate test facilities available to simulate the stress and temperature conditions of actual geothermal reservoirs. although some studies have analytically and numerically evaluated the mechanical properties of rocks under high temperatures and pressures (chester and higgs, 1992; , 2013; , 2016), to date none has captured the stress-strain behaviour and failure criteria of rocks over a wide range of confining pressures and temperatures, particularly for australian granite. however, the thermo-elastic response and appropriate failure criteria are essential inputs for many engineering applications under high pressures and temperatures, including geothermal extraction applications. this study therefore intends to fill this gap, and it is hoped it will make an important contribution to many deep underground applications. 2. methodology 2.1. tested material granite is an abundant crystalline rock in the earth with medium to coarse grains which was formed as a result of the slow cooling of magma. granite therefore has abundant radioactive elements (k, th, and u). such elements bring elevated geothermal gradients to deep granite reservoirs, which therefore have ideal conditions as geothermal reservoirs. the mineralogical composition of granite mainly consists of quartz, feldspar, plagioclase and biotite, and small amounts of muscovite, amphibole, hornblende and opaque (, 2008). for the present study, samples were collected from the strathbogie batholith, which is a composite granitoid intrusion body spreading over more than 1500 km2 in 150 km north-east from melbourne (). strathbogie granite is a high-level, discordant . sampling location of strathbogie batholith in central victoria.  physical, mechanical and petrographic properties of strathbogie granite (obtained under room temperature and atmospheric pressure conditions). rock type granite colour average grain size petrographic description bulk density (kg/m3) compressive strength (mpa) elastic modulus (gpa) porosity (%) \\u242em white with dark brown 70–600 mainly consists of feldspar, biotite, quartz and plagioclase equigranular, coarse grained, s-type granite 2703.4 118.17 9.09 1.16  results of xrd analysis. mineral id alpha quartz sodic and intermediate plagioclase biotite—phlogopite k-feldspar clinochlore muscovite—sericite dolomite—ankerite other minerals mass% 50 16 15 13 2 2 1 1 granite that mainly consists of quartz, k-feldspar, cordierite and biotite (, 1981). the selected granite type is coarsegrained and white and dark brown in colour with around 1.16% porosity.  presents a close-up view of a typical strathbogie granite sample, an optical microscopic image and an sem image of its thin section. as can be seen in (b), clear mineralogical assembling can be observed in the granite specimen, mainly with quartz, k-feldspar and plagioclase. as shown in , the grain size was measured from a thin section of this granite and found to be \\u242em with only a small number mainly in the range of 0 mm–200 of larger grains (>300 mm) (, 2014).  summarizes the physical, mechanical and petrographic properties of the tested strathbogie granite. in addition, an xrd analysis was conducted to determine the mineralogical composition of the selected granite and the result is shown in . as the table shows, quartz is the predominant mineral in the selected granite (50%), followed by 16% of sodic and intermediate biotite and 15% of plagioclase. the mineralogical composition of this particular granitic composition is representative of the composition of the majority of the earth’s granites (best, 1995). all the physical properties in  and 2\\x0c46 w.g.p.  / geothermics 65 (2017) 44–59 .

(a) dilatancy and failure by strain softening under relatively low confining pressures and (b) failure by strain hardening under elevated confining pressures, and a transitional regime may be observed at intermediate pressures. these transitional failure modes have been referred to as “quasi-brittle”, and complex localized features such as conjugate shear bands can be observed under such conditions (, 2001; , 2004). by visual inspection of the post-failure samples, important information about the alteration of the granite failure mechanism with confining pressures and temperatures can be identified. postfailure images () were therefore collected after each test. according to the post-failure images, specimens that failed at 10–60 mpa confining pressures mainly failed by shear localization along an inclined macroscopic shear band with a single shear zone across each sample. however, samples tested at higher confinements of 90 mpa and 120 mpa (at 100 ◦c) exhibited strain hardening characteristics after achieving the peak stress, and several conjugate shear bands could be observed on the cylindrical sample surface, instead of the single shear band observed earlier. this characteristic was significant at 120 mpa confining pressure. however, it should be noted that only one test was conducted at 120 mpa confinement, because at such high confining pressures the corresponding failure load of granite exceeds the bottom pedestal’s load-bearing capacity. further, a progressive reduction was observed in the failure plane angle with respect to the minor principal stress direction with increasing confining pressure, which implies a reduction in friction angle, possibly due to the greater quasi-brittle behaviour that was shown by granite samples at higher confining pressures (, 2001). 3.2. effect of temperature and confining pressure on mechanical properties of strathbogie granite  illustrates the inﬂuence of temperature on the deviatoric stress of the tested granite under each confinement. as the figure shows, the inﬂuence of confinement is more significant than that of temperature in the temperature range considered here. wong and brace (1979) confirm that at lower confining pressures considerable thermal cracking occurs at relatively low temperatures. if thermal cracking is responsible for the reduction in failure strength, a sharp reduction in deviatoric stress with increasing temperature (with suppression of thermal cracks) should be exhibited under unconfined pressure condition. however, based on the experimental results, under unconfined conditions, up to 100 ◦c, 17.6% of increment in deviatoric stress is followed by 2.5% and 10.5% reductions at 200 ◦c and 300 ◦c, respectively. however, when confinement was applied, strength reduction was initiated after higher temperature of 200 ◦c, mainly due to the inhibition of a thermal cracks by induced compressive force. thermal cracking is therefore an important strength property alteration mechanism in reservoir rocks under certain confining pressure conditions. a clear inﬂuence of temperature on deviatoric stress at any depth or confinement can be observed, and increasing the temperature from room temperature to 200 ◦c causes an increment in deviatoric stress, and further increasing of temperature to 300 ◦c causes a slight reduction in it. this is because the thermal expansion which occurs with increasing temperature causes the reduction of .

which is only 0.19% of maximum measurement. during the load application, the axial strain was measured using linear variable differential transducers (lvdts) attached to the ram of the load cell ((a)). an acoustic emission (ae) system was also employed in the testing of samples to record the data related to the fracturing process. the ae system adopted was a peripheral component interconnection (pci) system with a nominal resolution frequency of 500 khz. during the experiments, two sensors were attached to either side of the loading shaft and with the external amplifiers, which generated low frequency acoustic waves with the fracturing of the sample. in addition, possible micro-structural and mineralogical changes that occurred during thermal and confinement effects were checked using sem analyses. 3. results and discussion 3.1. the overall stress-strain response the inﬂuence of temperature on the stress-strain behaviour of the tested granite was considered first

between mineral grains with different thermoelastic moduli and thermal conductivities, resulting in reduced rock strength (kranz, 1983; homand-etienne and houpert, 1989). according to the tri-axial

characteristics were relatively small up to 500 ◦c and beyond that an accelerated downward trend was identified. furthermore, wider localized zones were observed at high temperatures in the post-failure images. however, these studies were conducted at wider temperature ranges (up to 700 ◦c and 900 ◦c, respectively) and the researchers therefore did not pay close attention to reservoir rock behaviour under relatively low geothermal temperature ranges (<300 ◦c). this was the focus of the present study, according to which there is an initial strengthening and stiffening in granite with increasing temperature at low temperatures (up to 200 ◦c), and increasing the temperature beyond a certain value causes a gradual reduction in failure stress with increasing temperature. elastic modulus is an important mechanical property of any reservoir rock, and describes the brittle characteristics of the rock mass. it is therefore often used to evaluate many in-situ stress applications, including wellbore stability, fracturing possibility and tectonic stress distribution (heard and page, 1982). the temperature-dependent brittle properties (elastic modulus) of the tested granite were then evaluated. the elastic region of each stress-strain curve was used to calculate the temperature and pressure-dependent young’s moduli (e) and the results are shown in . the axial strain was measured using lvdts attached to the loading ram with a linearity ±0.1% f.s (full scale) (±0.0075 mm) and infinite resoluerror of tion (no hysteresis). an increment of the modulus of strathbogie granite with increasing temperature up to 200 ◦c can be observed, and further increase of temperature (to 300 ◦c) causes the elastic modulus to be slightly reduced for any confinement. this trend is\\x0ca ‘brittle’ or general increment in elastic modulus with increasing confinement can be observed until 90 mpa, and a further increase of confinement (to 120 mpa) reduces the young’s modulus considerably. with increasing confining stress additional plastic deformation occurs, exhibiting strain-hardening characteristics in granite under high confinements. however, within the range of the experiments conducted (10 mpa–120 mpa) it cannot be definitively identified as a ’ductile’ regime. however, the strain-hardening behaviour observed at 120 mpa indicates transitional characteristics and this can be identified as ‘quasi-brittle’ behaviour (, 2001). the initial young’s modulus reduction with increasing confinement was observed by heard and page (1982), who conducted tests up to 55 mpa confining pressure. however, the latter behaviour was not observed by these researchers. interestingly, according to the research literature, at low temperatures (<200 ◦c) some granite types are more temperature-sensitive, while in contrast, some granites are more temperature-sensitive at high temperatures. the initial strength enhancement is more significant for coarse-grained granites and granodiorite than for fine-grained granites. for example, according to heard and page (1982), stripa granite is more sensitive to temperature at relatively low temperatures (<200 ◦c), and westerly granite is more sensitive to temperature at high temperatures (>200 ◦c). such contradictory behaviours may occur in granite due to the different grain size distributions, grain orientations, mineralogical compositions and heterogeneity of different granite types. this indicates the importance of studying the mineralogical composition and microstructural inﬂuence of granites on such on temperature-dependent strength variations. 3.3. effect of temperature on shear strength parameters of strathbogie granite  illustrates the variation of deviatoric stress of the tested granite with confining pressure for each temperature. the figure shows that increasing confinement causes the granite’s deviatoric stress to increase non-linearly and gradually come to a steady state. this is consistent with similar previous studies, which have clearly shown the enhancement of rock strength with increasing confinement, and the increasing rate is reduced with increasing confining pressure (barton, 2013; , 2011). this is because at low confining pressures there is a high dilation potential. therefore, the ability to open rock micro-cracks is high, resulting in higher friction angles. however, this dilation potential and the corresponding tendency for micro-cracks to open are suppressed with increasing confinement, resulting in lower friction angles at higher confining pressures. therefore, the failure mechanism of the rocks shifts from brittle to ductile with increasing confinement, changing the shape of the mohr-coulomb failure envelope, and according to barton (1976), at critical confining pressure the mohr-coulomb failure envelope reaches a zero gradient. this has also been shown by hoek (1983). the present study has clearly identified this rock behaviour in the mohr-coulomb failure envelopes developed for each temperature condition (refer to ). according to , the traditional linear mohr-coulomb criteria are applicable only in the brittle region of the failure envelope, and at higher confinew.g.p.  / geothermics 65 (2017) 44–59 consistent with the temperature-dependent strength behaviour of the granite described above. the reason for the initial elastic module increment may be that the specimen becomes more brittle at the initial temperature ranges due to thermally-induced volumetric expansion and the associated pore volume reduction. the later slight reduction of young’s modulus with increasing temperature exhibits an enhancement in ductile behaviour (quasi-brittle characteristics) with further increase of temperature. this is possibly due to the increased crack density caused by the induced thermal crack development and the related weakening of the granite. 600 500 400 300 200 100 0 50 σ1-σ3(mpa) 0 100 temperature (ºc) 200

angle and (b) cohesion with different temperatures (considering linear region of the mohr coulomb failure envelope). the latter positive effect of temperature on cohesion, according to wong and brace (1979), increasing the temperature to an extreme value may cause weakening of the grain boundaries, dependent on the anisotropy of the rock matrix (due to potentially existing distinct mineral compounds in granite those may contain different thermo-elastic moduli and this may causes to generate different internal stresses with heating). according to wong and brace (1979), increasing the temperature causes the induction of thermal cracks in the rock mass due to the associated generation of internal stresses (eq. (2)): (2) e(cid:4)˛(cid:4)t = \\u2434 where, e, \\x01␣, \\x01t is the matrix young’s modulus, difference of thermal expansion coefficient of distinct mineral and temperature difference, respectively. when the internal stress (given by eq. (2)) exceeds the crack closure pressure with increasing temperature, thermal cracks form and further increase of temperature provides the surface energy required for the propagation of the initiated crack (, 2007). this results in alteration of the grain-tograin contacts in the rock matrix, which leads to reduced cohesion at higher temperatures. in the case of the variation of friction angle with increasing temperature, the granite friction angle appears to remain steady up to around 100 ◦c (52◦) and then slightly increases with increasing temperature (54◦ at 200 and 300 ◦ c, respectively). the friction between grain-to-grain contacts may be altered by the thermally-induced micro-structural modifications. however, this effect on grain contact is expected to be smaller at relatively low temperatures, resulting in relatively steady friction angle with increasing temperature at lower temperatures. however, a slight ments non-linearity must be taken into account. in addition to the confinement, according to this study, increasing temperature also alters the failure envelope of granite. an initial increment in deviatoric stress with increasing temperature can be observed up to 200 ◦c and further increase of temperature (to 300 ◦c) causes it to be slightly reduced. the temperature-dependent shear parameters of granite were investigated next, and the shear parameters can be obtained from the mohr-coulomb failure envelope. as suggested by  (2011), the mohr-coulomb parameters (cohesion and friction angle) were calculated using eq. (1), taking into account the linear region of the obtained mohr-coulomb failure envelope (considering only smaller confining stresses, up to 30 mpa) for each temperature condition to obtain the temperature-dependent shear strength parameters ().

(continued) enhancement in friction angle with increasing temperature can be seen, probably due to the increased resistance of mineral particles to external deformation as a result of the thermally-induced energy in the mineral particles. however, compared with cohesion, the temperature dependency on friction angle is relatively insignificant within the temperature region considered here. initial enhancement in shear parameters in sandstone with increasing temperature has been observed by  (2015) at relatively low temperature regions, and these researchers observed reduction in friction angle from 33.02◦ to 31.93◦ and an increment a in cohesion from 61.47 mpa to 66.44 mpa with increasing temperature from 25 ◦c to 100 ◦c. further, bauer and johnson (1979) observed around 10% reduction in cohesion and 40% reduction in friction angle in westerly granite with increasing temperature from room temperature to 300 ◦c, and  (1979) observed 7% reduction in cohesion and a 38% reduction in friction angle a with increasing temperature from room temperature to 400 ◦c and 300 ◦c, respectively. however, the variation of shear strength parameters with increasing temperature at relatively low temperatures (<300 ◦c) was not considered in the above studies. the observed initial shear strengthening may be due to the inhibition of micro-crack propagation by the plasticity mechanism which occurs at crack tips (duclos and paquet (1991)) at low temperatures. with further increment of temperature, the reduction of shear strength parameters can be expected, due to the thermal weakening of the rock micro-structure. furthermore, according to the sem studies conducted by  (2007), large local plastic deformations and extremely rough cleavage fractures occur at relatively low temperatures. moreover, due to the volume expansion, the distance between the interfaces of the individual minerals decreases with the enhancement of their mutual attraction, and the strength of the bonds increases (dmitriev, 1972). both of these phenomena can be considered to explain the stress strengthening of granite under relatively low temperatures when subjected to confining pressures. 3.4. analysis of fracturing behaviour using ae technology acoustic emission (ae) detection technology is a powerful nondestructive tool to study crack propagation processes in brittle materials, including the stages of crack initiation, growth and crack damage (lockner, 1993). when a brittle material is under stress, strain energy is released during the development of new cracks or the widening of existing cracks. this energy is released in the form of elastic stress waves from the crack tips, and can be captured and amplified by an ae system. ae detection technology has therefore been widely used in a number of previous studies to understand the crack development mechanism in brittle materials (chang and lee, 2004; , 2000; , 2005). by incorporating the crack propagation pattern into the stressstrain relationship of the cracking material, the crack development process can be divided into several stages. hoek and bieniawski (1965) divided crack formation into five main stages: crack closure, crack initiation, secondary cracking, crack coalescence and crack damage. later,  (2008) and  (2015) incorporated stress-strain curves into cumulative ae counts/energy and strain plots. in the crack propagation process, with the gradual increment of loading on brittle materials, most pre-existing cracks are first closed, releasing an insignificant number of ae counts. this initial crack closure period is followed by the stable crack propagation period, which can be identified by the release of gradual ae energy increments. further increment of loading causes an exponential increase in ae energy, indicating an unstable crack propagation period with failure approaching. the crack closure threshold ((cid:2)cc) is defined as the stress threshold at which the initial ae counts are identified. anan initial increment in cumulative ae\\x0c54 w.g.p.  / geothermics 65 (2017) 44–59 counts can be seen at the crack initiation ((cid:2)ci) threshold, and the cumulative ae counts starts exponential growth at the crack damage ((cid:2)cd) threshold. the region between the crack closure threshold and the crack initiation threshold is generally defined as the stable crack closure region, where linear elastic deformation occurs. the region between the crack initiation threshold and the crack damage threshold is defined as the stable crack propagation region, and the region between the crack damage threshold and sample failure is identified as the unstable crack propagation region. the application of compressive loading fails rocks through either shear localization (brittle regime) or cataclastic ﬂow, and the surrounding conditions, such as temperatures and pressures, may cause a homogenous plastic ﬂow. according to existing studies, axial intra-granular cracking and shear rupturing of cemented grain contacts can be observed before failure in brittle regimes, and grain crushing and pore collapse can be identified before failure in cataclastic ﬂow regimes (, 1996). according to  (1997), the development of local stress concentrations leads to the initiation of many intra-granular micro-cracks in the rock mass, and the crack density increases with increasing deviatoric stress and tends to merge on reaching the peak stress, resulting in strain softening and shear localization. these damage processes are clearly identified by the intense ae activities in the field (chang and lee, 2004). ae technology was therefore used to investigate the progressive fracturing behaviour in strathbogie granite under tri-axial conditions.  illustrates the cumulative ae events with axial stress at various pressures and temperatures for the tested specimens. the corresponding variations of deviatoric stress against strain are also included in the same plots to identify the stress thresholds for crack closure, crack initiation and crack damage (). the very high ae counts in strathbogie granite at dilatancy in the pre-failure stage are due to the fact that ae waves generate when the local shear stress concentration at a grain contact is sufficiently high to rupture the grain boundaries, and frictional slips and grain rotations may occur once the grain contacts have lost their cohesion. in the present study, crack threshold ratios were defined to identify the temperature and pressure-dependent crack propagation in the tested granite as follows, and  shows the crack propagation stress threshold ratios of granite specimens tested at various confining pressures and temperatures. crack closure stress threshold = deviatoric stress at crack closure stress deviatoric stress at failure ((cid:2)cc) crack initiation stress threshold = deviatoric stress at crack initiation stress deviatoric stress at failure ((cid:2)ci) crack damage stress threshold = deviatoric stress at crack damage stress ((cid:2)cd) deviatoric stress at failure according to the results, the beginning of crack damage occurs at earlier stages of deviatoric loading for higher confining pressures. however, the crack damage stress increases with increasing confinement due to the inﬂuence of confining pressure on thermal crack development and the suppression of the extension/widening of existing micro-cracks. according to , in the temperature range considered here, three tendencies can be identified with increasing confining pressure: increase of the elastic deformation region, decrease of the stable crack propagation region, and increase of the unstable crack propagation region. the crack initiation stress threshold also progressively increases with increasing confining pressure, which can be attributed to the fact that the brittle behaviour of rock specimens at lower confining pressures changes to quasi-brittle behaviour with increasing confining pressure. this is because the suppression of micro-crack development is less at low confining pressures, and therefore sudden failures mostly occur, and the beginning of crack initiation occurs at earlier stages of deviatoric loading at high confining pressures due to the higher normal stress acting on micro-cracks, resulting in limited progression of cracking before failure. in relation to the temperature effect, increasing the temperature causes an initial increment in the crack propagation stress threshold, followed by a slight reduction for all the temperature conditions considered. for example, at 30 mpa confinement, the crack damage stress threshold ratios increased by around 6.8%, 10.5% with increasing temperature from room temperature to 100 and 200 ◦c, respectively, and reduced by around 4.0% when the temperature increased to 300 ◦c. this implies that at low temperatures a suppressed micro-crack development mechanism is dominant, and increasing the temperature causes crack damage to occur at earlier loading stages. interestingly, at 60 mpa confinement the crack damage stress threshold ratio increased by around 4.9%, 5.4%, 2.6% with increasing temperature from room to 100, 200 and 300 ◦c, respectively. this exhibits the cumulative effect of temperature and pressure micro-crack development in the rock mass. at relatively low temperatures, micro-crack propagation may be inhibited by the thermally-induced plasticity mechanism which occurs at crack tips and the increased bonding strength through thermally-induced rock matrix expansion (which increases crack stress thresholds). however, further increase of temperature creates thermally-induced cracks and causes the grain boundary cracks to widen, resulting in early crack damage. further, with the inﬂuence of confinement, micro-crack development is suppressed, causing a relatively low increment of crack damage stress threshold ratios at higher confinements. 3.5. corresponding alterations in granite micro-structure a comprehensive micro-structural analysis was also performed to identify the interior correspondences of the above-described temperature-dependent mechanical behaviour of granite. sem and optical microscopic analyses were performed on thin sections of granite specimens at various temperatures: room temperature (20 ◦c), pre-heated (72 hours) to 200 ◦c and 400 ◦c (). these temperatures were selected to identify the microstructural behaviour at 200 ◦c, at which the highest strength increment was observed, and 400 ◦c, at which clear thermally-induced rock mass weakening was observed. a specimen at room temperature was used as a control. based on optical microscope imaging, mineralogical assembling in the granite specimen could be identified by the colour and texture of each of the mineral assemblages. further, a detailed sem study was performed using scanning electron imaging (sei) and bsei back-scatter electron imaging (bsei) techniques. bsei images taken at low magnifications clearly show different mineral assemblages and grain boundaries (see ). using energy-dispersive x-ray (edx) technology with aztec oxford instruments, chemical component mapping was generated in each specimen, and each mineral was identified qualitatively. the bright colour images observed in edx images indicate higher concentration (higher energy dispersion) while dark colour areas indicate lower concentration (lower energy dispersion). based on the spectrum of each point (point id), the corresponding mineral was identified and a map spectrum provided overall elements available for each specimen. according to  and 14, there are clear mineralogical assembling in the granite specimens, mainly with quartz, kfeldspar and plagioclase. the heating of granite up to 200 ◦c temperature has not caused any significant thermally-induced micro-cracks (in addition to the pre-existing faults and grain boundaries) and almost all grain boundaries remain intact. however, further heating of granite to the higher temperature of 400 ◦c caused the induction of some micro-cracks, mainly

some grain boundary cracks running along grain boundaries and around pore boundaries could be identified. a considerable number of cracks were propagated after 400 ◦c at triple junctions dominantly in quartz feldspar boundaries. however, only a few grain\\x0c56 w.g.p.  / geothermics 65 (2017) 44–59 . optical microscopic and sem images of thin sections of strathbogie granite (a) at room temperature; (b) pre-heated to 100 ◦c (c) pre-heated to 400 ◦c. boundaries have been partially parted and a significant number of grain boundaries appear to remain intact up to this temperature. furthermore, based on the edx mapping, it was confirmed that intra-granular cracks are mainly initiated along the feldspar and quartz minerals. intragranular cracks were mainly observed in larger crystals (crystals greater than 0.5 mm) and smaller crystals remained un-parted even at 400 ◦c. for strathbogie granite, thermally-induced intra-granular micro-cracks seem to play a significant role at relatively low temperatures, probably due to the presence of relatively high k feldspar and biotite contents. similar observations have been reported in bauer and johnson’s (1979) study conducted for charcoal granite, where intra-granular microcracks predominantly occur compared to grain boundary cracks. the sem analysis is also consistent with this finding, which exhibits inhibition of micro-crack development followed by micro-cracking at relatively high temperatures. the crack propagation process in any rock mass is largely inﬂuenced by the mineralogical composition, because cracks normally propagate through weaker planes of the rock mass. since granite is an igneous type of rock, two main types of thermallyinduced cracking modes can be identified: inter-granular and intragranular. the amount of inter-granular or intra-granular cracking is dependent on the stress state, rock type and mineralogy of the rock mass. inter-granular cracks occur along grain boundaries, pre-existing faults and micro-cracks of the rock, while intragranular cracks occur through weaker mineralogical constituents (kranz, 1983). for example, k feldspar and biotite are weaker mineralogical constituents due to their large crystals (>10 mm), as crystals greater than 2–3 mm in size are generally defined as weaker mineralogical constituents compared to equi-dimensional small crystals like quartz (homand-etienne and houpert, 1989). based on experimental results, intra-granular cracking is highly temperature-dependent due to the temperature dependent dislocations in the rocks. this is because different mineralogical components have different thermo-elastic moduli and thermal conductivities (kranz, 1983; , 2008). these observations suggest that micro-cracking in granite is highly temperature dependent, as evidenced by the previously observed initial strength gain followed by slight strength reduction with increasing temperature in the tested granite. however, this shows that granite needs to be heated to a sufficient temperature to cause thermal cracks in it and therefore, heating to a lower temperature may only cause a strength gain through the thermal expansion of the rock matrix. this is consistent with the results of bauer and johnson (1979). the mechanical properties of charcoal granite in their study remained relatively steady until 200 ◦c, and westerly granite exhibited a significant thermal dependency, even at relatively low temperatures (<200 ◦c). in homand-etienne and houpert (1989) study, the variation of uni-axial compressive strength of both semones and remiremont granites is insignificant until 400 ◦c, followed by significant reductions at higher temperatures. these results indicate the dependency of mineralogical composition and grain size distribution on the temperature dependent mechanical behaviour in various types of granites. however,\\x0cw.g.p.  / geothermics 65 (2017) 44–59 57 . bse images of strathbogie granite with edx mapping:

different confining pressures (10, 30, 60, 90 mpa) and four different temperatures (rt, 100, 200, 300 ◦c), simulating various geothermal reservoir conditions. the following conclusions can be drawn: mechanical behaviour of the tested granite is inﬂuenced by both reservoir depth and temperature, and the depth effect is much greater than the temperature effect. granite located at relatively smaller depths appears to fail through shear localization and increasing depth may cause this to change to ductile failure through strain hardening. a progressive enhancement in stress threshold with increasing confining pressure is observed in strathbogie granite. such behaviours exhibit greater strength and lower brittle characteristics in granite located at greater depths. increasing of temperature causes granite’s strength to be enhanced up to a certain temperature (around 200 ◦c for strathbogie granite) through the possible thermal expansion of the rock matrix and further increasing of temperature may cause it to weaken by inducing thermal cracks. this was confirmed by the micro-structural analysis, which did not reveal any noticeable amount of thermally-induced micro-cracking in strathbogie granite up to 200 ◦c, and heating of the granite to a greater temperature as 400 ◦c caused many intra-granular cracks in quartz and feldspar and some grain boundary cracks between quartz and feldspar minerals. furthermore, according to ae analysis, increasing the temperature first causes the crack propagation stress threshold to increase and further increasing of the temperature causes it to be slightly reduced. this indicates a suppression of micro-cracks at low temperatures by matrix expansion and the development of micro-cracks through thermally-induced damage at higher temperatures. finally an attempt was made to improve the conventional mohrcoulomb failure criteria for geothermal reservoirs with extreme pressures and temperatures, because the conventional criteria are not applicable to extreme conditions. acknowledgements this research project is funded by the australian research council (arc dp160104223) and the authors would like to

reservoirs. the present study may therefore capture more realistic geothermal reservoir behaviour. 3.6. temperature-dependent failure criteria for strathbogie granite ≤ (3) − is questionable, due to the to date, although many strength criteria are available for intact rock, the practical application of most of them for geothermal reservoirs in-situ model parameters required when considering the available high-pressure and high-temperature environment in underground reservoirs. of the various failure criteria, the mohr-coulomb failure criteria have been extensively used in the field and have made a significant contribution to the determination of rock mass failure. however, they have some major limitations, including ignoring the intermediate stress (cid:2)2 inﬂuence (which has been proven to have a substantial inﬂuence on rock strength) and the assumed linearity (the strength criteria of rock are non-linear in reality). after re-analyzing thousands of reported triaxial experiments and combining the critical state concept proposed by barton (1976),  (2011) proposed a non-linear mohr-coulomb failure criterion. according to the findings of  (2011), the mohr-coulomb shear strength parameters should only be obtained by performing conventional tri-axial tests under low confining stresses (in the linear region of the mohr-coulomb failure envelope). according to their statistical analysis, (cid:2)cc ≈ (cid:2)crit, where (cid:2)c and (cid:2) crit are uni-axial compressive strength and critical confining pressure, respectively. the modified mohr-coulomb failure criterion proposed by  is given below: (cid:2)1 − (cid:2)3 = where, (cid:2)ci ≈ (cid:2)ci + 2sin(cid:3)i0 sin(cid:3)i0 ucs of the rock = 2ciocos(cid:3)i0/1 sin(cid:3)i0, (cid:3)i0 and cio are friction

failure criteria cannot be directly applied to geothermal reservoir rocks at extreme pressures and temperatures, because the strength response is altered by the thermal effect (heuze, 1983). to date, no extensive study has captured this thermal response in the improved mohrcoulomb failure criteria. such a realistic approach is necessary for deep underground engineering applications like geothermal energy extraction. the concepts of barton (1976) and  (2011) are therefore incorporated into the temperature inﬂuence in this study and an attempt is made to propose novel strength criteria for geothermal reservoir rocks based on experimental data: + 2sin(cid:3)i (t) sin(cid:3)i (t) (cid:2)3 − − 1 − (cid:2)3 (t) = 2ci (t) cos(cid:3)i (t) sin(cid:3)i (t) 1 (cid:2)1 − (4) (cid:2)3 ≤
