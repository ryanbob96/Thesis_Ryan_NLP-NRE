A better understanding of thermal conductivity of rocks is essential to safe evaluation and engineer-ing optimization of a HLW disposal system in the rock at depth. In the present study, experimental investigationson the thermal conductivity characteristics of 47 pairs of granitic rock specimens were conducted using theTransient Plane Source (TPS) method. The specimens were collected from borehole cores in the Beishan area,which is being considered as the most potential candidate area for China's HLW repository. To evaluate geologicalnature of the rocks, mineralogical compositions of the rocks were identi/uniFB01ed, and porosity of the specimens wasmeasured. The thermal conductivities of the specimens under dry and water-saturated conditions weredetermined, and the effect of water saturation on the thermal conductivity was investigated. In addition, thein/uniFB02uence of temperature and axial compression stress on the thermal conductivity of dry specimens was studied.The results revealed that the thermal conductivity of tested rocks was dependent on water saturation, tempera-ture and compression stress. Based on the obtained data, some models considering porosity were established fordescribing the thermal conductivity characteristics of the tested rocks. Furthermore, when the rocks have asimilar porosity, the quartz content dominates the thermal conductivity, and there exists an obvious increaseof the thermal conductivity with increasing quartz content. The test results constitute the/uniFB01rst systematicmeasurements on the Beishan granitic rocks and can further be used for the development of thermal modelsfor predicting thermal response near the underground excavations for HLW disposal.© 2016 Elsevier B.V.

IntroductionDeep geological disposal has been the internationally acceptedapproach for the permanent disposal of high level radioactive waste(HLW) generated from nuclear power plants and other nuclear facili-ties. An HLW repository can be constructed in a host rock at a depth ofseveral hundred meters below the ground surface. The design of HLWrepositories often relies on a multi-barrier system, which typically con-sists of the natural geological barrier and an engineered barrier system.As the last defense to the biosphere, the natural geological barrier(i.e., the host rock) plays a critical role in ensuring the long-term safetyof the HLW repositories. Because crystalline rocks such as granite anddiorite have low permeability, high solidity, and good excavation stabil-ity, they have been considered as potential HLW repository formationsin some countries (Hudson et al., 2011; Wang, 2014). Site selection forChina's HLW repository started in 1985 (Wang, 2010). The effortshave been focused on potential HLW repository sites located withingranite intrusions in mainland China. Since 1999, the Beijing ResearchInstitute of Uranium Geology (BRIUG) has performed site characteriza-tion studies in the Beishan area, China. So far, the Beishan area hasbeen considered as the most potential candidate area for China'sHLW repository.Among all the engineering properties of crystalline rocks at apotential HLW repository site, the thermal conductivity is one ofthe most important parameters in design consideration because ithas a direct impact on the evaluation of the necessary repository vol-ume and the optimization of the repository layout (Sundberg andHellström, 2009). For instance, in the Swedish KBS-3 concept forgeological disposal of spent fuel, copper canisters with cast ironinserts containing the spent fuel are surrounded by bentonite for iso-lation and mechanical protection (Brantberger et al., 2006). The heatgenerated by the spent fuel will increase the temperature of all com-ponents of the repository. For the bentonite buffer outside the canis-ters, the peak temperature must not exceed 100 °C. This requirementimplies that the canisters cannot be deposited arbitrarily close toeach other. On the other hand, unnecessarily large distancesbetween the canisters will mean inef/uniFB01cient and costly use of therepository rock volume (Hökmark et al., 2009). To ful/uniFB01ll the temper-ature requirement, the rocks with low thermal conductivities willTectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137\\n\\n/uni204ECorresponding author.E-mail address:xingguang100@126.com(X.G.

       " 'lead to a larger distance between canisters than for a case withhigh thermal conductivities. This is because the rocks with lowthermal conductivities will give rise to higher temperatures in thebentonite (Sundberg et al., 2008). Hence, to design and constructrepositories successfully, it is essential to perform an accurate as-sessment of the thermal conductivity characteristics of the host rock.Over the past few decades, various experimental approaches havebeen employed to measure the thermal conductivity of rocks. The re-sults indicate that the thermal conductivity of rocks is closely associatedwith mineral composition, porosity, texture, and density, etc. (Birch andClark, 1940; Clauser and Huenges, 1995; Hartmann et al., 2005;Özkahraman et al., 2004; Pasquale et al., 2015; Ray et al., 2007;Sundberg et al., 2009). For crystalline rocks with relatively homoge-neous texture and low porosity, the mineral composition dominatesthe thermal conductivity. In volcanic and sedimentary rocks, the highvariability of porosity in these rocks is a major factor controlling thethermal conductivity (Clauser and Huenges, 1995; Özkahraman et al.,2004). For example, increasing porosity, which acts as barrier to the/uniFB02ow of heat, often results in both lower P-wave velocity and lowerthermal conductivity values (Özkahraman et al., 2004). For a givenrock, water content and temperature have an in/uniFB02uence on its thermalconductivity. Generally, the thermal conductivity of the rock increasesand decreases with increasing water content (Cho and Kwon, 2010;Cho et al., 2009)andtemperature(Abdulagatova et al., 2009; Birchand Clark, 1940; Heuze, 1983; Miao et al., 2014; Mottaghy et al., 2008;Vosteen and Schellschmidt, 2003), respectively. Moreover, the effectof water saturation on the thermal conductivity of rocks shows a gener-ally increasing trend with increasing porosity (Nagaraju and Roy, 2014).Given that the thermal conductivity of surrounding rocks aroundthe excavations will be changed by the excavation-induced stress,some researchers studied the in/uniFB02uence of pressure on the thermalconductivity of rocks (Abdulagatova et al., 2010; Abdulagatova et al.,2009; Demırcıet al., 2004; Görgülü et al., 2008; Sibbitt, 1976; Walshand Decker, 1966; Zimmerman, 1989). One of the main/uniFB01ndingsachieved from these investigations shows that the thermal conductivityvaries with the pressure exerted on the rock. With increasing appliedpressure, the thermal conductivity starts to increase and subsequentlythe increase rate tends to be a constant value due to gradual closureof cracks and pores within the rock (Görgülü et al., 2008; Walsh andDecker, 1966).While the above-mentioned studies provide meaningful insight intothe thermal conductivity of various rocks, the thermal conductivitycharacteristics of low-porosity crystalline rocks subjected to differentexternal factors such as water saturation, temperature and compressionstress have not been fully understood. On the other hand, the informa-tion on the thermal conductivity of rocks in a potential HLW repositorysite must be known with suf/uniFB01cient con/uniFB01dence to provide necessaryinput conditions for its long-term safety assessment, which is one ofthe motivations for this study. In this work, experimental investigationson the thermal conductivity of the Beishan granitic rocks are conductedusing the Transient Plane Source (TPS) method. In the followingdiscussion, rock sampling and basic physical properties of the rockspecimens are introduced/uniFB01rst. Testing facilities and procedures arethen described. Subsequently, the water saturation, temperature andcompression stress dependent thermal conductivity characteristics ofthe tested rocks are evaluated comprehensively, and/uniFB01nally someinsights are obtained.2. Rock sampling and preparationThe Beishan area is situated in Gansu Province of northwesternChina (seeFig. 1). After a long geological evolution and weatheringprocess, the topography of this area is characterized by a/uniFB02at Gobi and\\nsmall gentle rolling hills with elevations ranging between 1400 and2000 m above the sea level. The crust in this area possesses a blockystructure with many granite intrusions (seeFig. 2). Other surroundingrocks include mainly metamorphic and sedimentary rocks, as well asQuaternary cover. Rock sampling was carried out in the Jijicao andXinchang rock blocks, which are currently considered as two of thekey investigation sub-areas during site selection and characterization.\\n\\n\\nFig. 1.Geographical location of the Beishan area and a photo showing its typical topography.125X.G.

       " 'Intact drill cores with a diameter of approximately 63 mm were takenfrom six sub-vertical boreholes (i.e., boreholes BS05, BS06, BS15, BS16,BS18 and BS19) in these two sub-areas. The borehole locations arepresented inFig. 2.Field observations indicated that the collected granitic rockswere relatively isotropic in texture and mineralogical composition. Toevaluate the geological nature of the rocks, a series of thin sectionswere prepared and then exposed to cross-polarized light under anoptical microscope to identify the dominant minerals in the rocks. Thepercentages of the dominant minerals were determined by pointcounting on thin sections. For each thin section approximately 500points covering phenocrysts and groundmass were counted. Accordingto the quartz-alkali feldspar-plagioclase (QAP) diagram (Streckeisen,1976), the rocks can further be classi/uniFB01ed. It can be observed fromFig. 3that the rocks contain mainly a moderate to low amount of quartzand alkali feldspar, and a moderate to high amount of plagioclase. Thismeans that the collected rocks dominantly range from granodiorite tomonzogranite. For grain size characteristics, the rocks are from/uniFB01negrained to, medium to coarse grained. An overview of the basic informa-tion of the rocks is listed inTable 1. Based on the borehole no. andsampling depth, these rocks have been divided into eight groups.A total of 47 pairs of rock specimens, 50 mm in diameter, wereprepared from the drill cores with a length to diameter ratio of approx-imately 0.5. In particular, specimen ends were polished carefully using agrinding machine until the/uniFB02atness and roughness of the ends are lessthan 10/uni03BCmand3/uni03BCm, respectively. The/uniFB02at and polished specimenend surfaces minimize the thermal contact resistance during thermalconductivity measurement. A minimum of ten specimens for eachrock group were prepared.3. Test methodology3.1. An introduction to the used TPS methodIn the/uniFB01elds of geology and geophysics, laboratory approaches tomeasuring soil and rock thermal conductivity can mainly be dividedinto two groups: steady state and transient state. In this work, theTransient Plane Source (TPS) method (Gustafsson, 1991; Log andGustafsson, 1995) was utilized to measure the thermal conductivity ofthe specimens. As one of the transient measurement methods, the TPStechnique is based on the use of a transiently heated plane sensor(i.e., Hot Disk sensor) and a Hot Disk Thermal Constants Analyser (seeFig. 4a). The used Hot Disk TPS2500S system can measure thermalconductivity of materials ranging from 0.01 to 400 W/mK. The HotDisk sensor consists of a continuous double spiral, which is etched outof a thin nickel foil (Fig. 4e). This spiral is sandwiched between twosheets of electrical insulation materials made of Kapton. The sensoracts both as a heat source for increasing the temperature of the speci-mens and as a dynamic temperature sensor for recording the tempera-ture increase. During the measurement, the temperature in the sensorrises and heat starts to/uniFB02ow to the specimens. The temperature rise inthe sensor provides an indicator of the thermal properties of the speci-mens. If the specimens have good thermal conducting properties, theheat will be transported rapidly inside the specimens. On the contrary,if the specimens have good thermal insulation properties, the sensortemperature will rise faster and the heat will not be transportedas much as in the test of the good thermal conducting specimens.Compared with steady state measurement methods such as the dividedbar (Beck and Beck, 1958; Birch, 1950; Sass et al., 1971)andtheguardedhot plate (Abdulagatova et al., 2009; Alishaev et al., 2012), one of signif-icant advantages of the TPS technique is that the thermal conductivity ofmaterials can be measured more quickly, typically from several to tensof seconds. Hence, a long wait for thermal gradients to equilibrate isnot required and the moisture migration in response to temperaturegradients was minimized (Jackson and Taylor, 1986). On the otherhand, unlike some transient methods such as thermal needle probes(Barry-Macaulay et al., 2013; Von Herzen and Maxwell, 1959), whichare commonly used for soils and soft rocks, the TPS method can be\\nGranitic rockSedimentary rockMetamorphic rockFaultBoreholeQuaternary cover\\nBS15BS16BS06BS18BS19\\nJijicaoXinchang\\nN\\n2.5 km\\nBS05\\n\\nFig. 2.Rock sampling from six boreholes in the Jijicao and Xinchang sub-areas for thermal conductivity measurements.\\n\\nI - GranodioriteII - Monzogranite BS05\\nBS06\\nBS15\\nBS16\\nBS18-1\\nBS18-2\\nBS19-1\\nBS19-2\\n        II         I  10                 35                       65                  905                                                                                  520                                                                     2060                                   6090          90\\nPAQ\\n\\nFig. 3.QAP classi/uniFB01cation of the eight rock groups based on modal analysis.126X.G.

It should benoted that the TPS method measures the thermal conductivity in a con-tact manner, which is different from non-contact optical scanningmeasurements (Popov et al., 1999; Popov et al., 2003).

Theory of the TPS techniqueTo theoretically describe how the TPS method behaves, thethermal conductivity equation can be solved assuming that the HotDisk sensor consists of a certain number of concentric ring heatsources located in an in/uniFB01nitely large sample (Hot Disk, 2007). A con-stant electric power supplied to the sensor results in an increase intemperature which is directly related to the variation in the sensorresistance (R(t)) by the equation:RtðÞ¼R\\n01þα\\n/uni0394TτðÞ/C16/C17ð1ÞwhereR\\n0is the nickel electrical resistance in the beginning of therecording,αis the temperature coef/uniFB01cient of resistance of the nickelfoil, and\\n\\n/uni0394TðτÞis the mean value of temperature rise in the sensor dueto a constant current pulse given by:\\n\\n/uni0394TτðÞ¼P 0π3=2ak/C16/C17−1DτðÞ ð2ÞwhereP\\n0is the total output of power from the sensor,ais the sensorradius,kis the thermal conductivity of the sample that is beingtested andD(τ) is a dimensionless time dependent function with:τ¼t=θðÞ\\n1=2;θ¼a2=dð3Þwheretis the time measured from the start of the transientrecording,θis the characteristic time, which depends both onparameters of the sensor and the sample, anddis the thermaldiffusivity of the sample.According to Eq.(2), and\\n/uni0394TðτÞandD(τ) plotted as a function ofτprovides a linear relationship with a slope that is a function ofP\\n0,a,andk. Thermal conductivitykcan be obtained by/uniFB01tting the experimen-tal data to the straight line given by Eq.(2); thermal diffusivitydis cal-culated from Eq.(3)taking into account theτvaluedeterminedintheprevious/uniFB01t.As mentioned above, the solution of the thermal conductivityequation is based on the assumption that the Hot Disk sensor is locatedin an in/uniFB01nite material in perfect contact with the sensor surface.This means that the heat/uniFB02ow generated from each measurementmust not reach the outside boundaries of the specimen (Hot Disk,2007). Meanwhile, a careful preparation of specimen ends is requiredto minimize thermal contact resistance. An estimation of how far theheat/uniFB02ow has proceeded in the specimen during a recording is theprobing depth/uni0394\\np, which is de/uniFB01ned as (Hot Disk, 2007):/uni0394\\np¼2ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃdtpð4ÞTo determine the thermal conductivity with good accuracy, theshortest distance from any part of the sensor to the nearest outsideboundary of the sample should be larger than/uni0394\\np. In our experiments,the used Hot Disk sensor has a radius of 6.403 mm. The shortest distanceis about 19 mm, and the probing depth is approximately 10 mm. For thisprobing depth value, we can consider that we are conducting a bulkmeasurement.3.3. Test procedures3.3.1. Tests on specimens under saturated and dry conditionsFirstly, the specimens were immersed by deionized water in avacuum for a period of 96 h.

In orderto remain water saturation, the saturated specimens and the sensorwere kept in a plastic bag during thermal conductivity measurement(Adl-Zarrabi, 2004). After the test, the used water-saturated specimenswere suffered from dehydration treatment in a thermostatic dryingoven at 105 °C for a period of 24 h and subsequently cooled in adesiccator to measure the thermal conductivity under a dry condition.Meanwhile, the mass of the dry specimens (M\\ndry) was measured, andthe porosity (n) of the specimens was calculated using the equationsn¼\\n\\n100Vp\\nV%ð5ÞV\\np¼\\nMsat−Mdry\\nρw ð6ÞwhereVis the bulk rock volume,Vpis the pore volume, andρwis thedensity of water. For each pair of specimens saturated or dried,measurements on the thermal conductivity were carried out at roomtemperature (25 ± 1 °C).3.3.2. Tests on specimens under increasing temperatureTo investigate the effect of temperature on the thermal conductivityof the tested rocks, measurements were performed on dry specimensfrom 40 °C to 150 °C based on the requirements of the used testequipment. Compared with measurements at room temperature, theexperiments under high temperature are time consuming due to aslow stepwise heating process by using a constant temperature oilbath and a temperature control system, as shown inFig. 4c. The thermalconductivity measurement can only be conducted until the two speci-men pieces in the chamber with a specimen holder within the oil bathhave reached thermal equilibrium and kept a target temperaturevalue. During thermal equilibrium of the oil bath, the Hot Disk sensormonitors continuously the temperature variation of the specimens.For our tests, the thermal conductivity of the specimens was measuredwhen the recorded temperature variation of the specimens is less than0.04 °C. In general, 32 h were needed to complete one test. A typicaltemperature-time history during the test is presented inFig. 6.

       " 'be noted that the water-saturated specimens were not adopted in thistest because little was known about how the gradual heating and thethermal equilibrium processes would affect the water content of thespecimens, leading to dif/uniFB01culties in evaluating the relationship betweenthe thermal conductivity and the water saturation degree of thespecimens quantitatively.3.3.3. Tests on specimens under uniaxial compressionThe uniaxial compression tests on dry specimens were conductedusing a hydraulic servo-controlled compression machine. For eachtest, two specimen pieces with the Hot Disk sensor were containedbetween steel platens machined to match their end surfaces, as showninFig. 4b. The interfaces between the specimens and the steelplatens were daubed with a thin layer of lubricant to reduce theend effect of the platens during loading. When the experimentalsetup was completed, axial-load control was used with a loadingrate of 100 N/s and the axial load was increased with an incrementof 5 MPa. The thermal conductivity measurement was performed ateach incremental stress level. After each measurement, the loadwas maintained constant for a period of about 15 min to avoid resid-ual temperature drifts on the specimens. Based on the in-situ stressmeasurement results obtained from the Beishan area (Zhao et al.,2013), the maximum axial compression stress applied to thespecimens was set to be 45 MPa to approximately simulate theexcavation-induced stress near the vertical HLW disposal elementboundary at a depth of 600 m. The axial stress applied to the speci-mens was recorded automatically, and the used stress path through-out the course of testing is presented inFig. 7. The experiments wereconducted at room temperature.According to previous experimental results (Zhao et al., 2015a;Zhaoet al., 2015b), the identi/uniFB01ed crack initiation stresses of cylindrical spec-imens of Beishan granitic rocks under uniaxial compression using thecumulative AE hit (CAEH) method range from 45.3 to 109.1 MPa,which are larger than the maximum compression stress adopted inthe present study. Hence, the stress-induced rock damage might notoccur in the tested specimens during loading. It should be mentionedthat in the process of loading, the friction may occur at the interfacesbetween the specimen ends and the sensor. Due to limitation of theTPS measurement technique, the utilized test method does not considerthe potential in/uniFB02uence of interface friction effect on the experimentalresults. To reduce or eliminate the friction effect, further efforts areneeded to produce innovative design for the test equipment. Althoughnot perfect, the developed test system provides a feasible meansfor us to gain insight into thermal conductivity behaviors of rocksunder compression.4. Test results4.1. In/uniFB02uence of water saturation on the thermal conductivityThermal conductivity measurements were carried out on the 40pairs of specimens both in dry and water-saturated conditions, andthe results are listed inTable 2. A statistical analysis shows that for theeight rock groups under dry or saturated state, the standard deviation(SD) and coef/uniFB01cient of variation (CoV) of the thermal conductivity areall less than 0.06 W/mK and 4%, respectively, indicating that the resultsbetween specimens in each rock group have a good consistency.

When the dry specimenswere saturated with water, water with a higher thermal conductivity(0.604 W/mK) replaced the air with a lower thermal conductivity(0.025 W/mK) in the void of the rocks, leading to an increase of the ther-mal conductivity. For our data set, the mean thermal conductivity valuesof the saturated specimens in different rocks groups range from 6.5% to24.2% higher than those of dry ones.

Forexample, the rock groups BS05 and BS15 with average porosity valuesgreater than or equal to 0.68% exhibit higher thermal conductivity inthe water-saturated state relative to the dry state.To evaluate the thermal conductivity of rocks, various mixingmodels such as the geometric mean (Lichtenecker, 1924), the arithmet-ic mean (Voigt, 1928), the Hashin–Shtrikman mean (Hashin andShtrikman, 1962), and the effective-medium mean (Bruggeman, 1935;Clauser, 2009) have been proposed. Comprehensive overviews andcase studies on such mixing models can be found in (Abdulagatovaet al., 2009; Clauser, 2009; Fuchs et al., 2013; Hartmann, 2005;Rayet al., 2015). Based on the experimental data (seeTable 2) in combina-tion with the methodology used byFuchs et al. (2013),theabove-mentioned mixing models were used to predict the thermal conductiv-ity values of the tested rocks in the water-saturated state.Fig. 9showsthe comparison between measured and calculated thermal conductivi-ties for the four different models. It can be observed fromFig. 9a, b, and dthat the geometric mean, the arithmetic mean, and the effective-medium mean yield similar prediction results and consistently underes-timate the thermal conductivity of the eight rock groups, especially forthe groups with relatively high porosity values (e.g., groups BS05 andBS15). The Hashin–Shtrikman mean shows a reasonably good/uniFB01tforall rock groups, as shown inFig. 9c. The analysis results are basically inline with observations reported byFuchs et al. (2013)because most ofthe evaluated mixing models used in their analysis also underestimatethe thermal conductivity of the rocks. However, the geometric meanmodel was rated as the best/uniFB01t to their data set. It should be notedthat the rocks used in their analysis covered different rock types witha large range in porosity, from almost zero to about 30%. In addition,the measured thermal conductivity values of these rocks spans the in-terval between 1.0 and 6.5 W/mK. The present investigations focusedmainly on the granitic rocks with low porosities and a narrow thermalconductivity range. Hence, the large difference of rock properties mayresult in uncertainties between analysis results obtained from variousmixing models. More work is required to explain this discrepancy.Nagaraju and Roy (2014)de/uniFB01ned the effect of water saturation onthermal conductivity (S) as a function of porosity of rocks, andSisexpressed byS¼\\n\\nksat−kdry\\nkdry ð7ÞAccording to the measurement results listed inTable 2,weestablished the relationship betweenSand the porosity of the rocks,as presented inFig. 10. Analysis ofFig. 10reveals that the effect ofwater saturation on thermal conductivity of rocks presents anincreasing trend with an increase of porosity. A linear form expressioncan/uniFB01t the data reasonably well while ensuring that the line passesthrough the origin.4.2. In/uniFB02uence of temperature on the thermal conductivityFig. 11presents the variation of thermal conductivity of seven pairsof dry specimens in different rock groups with temperature from 40 °Cto 150 °C. The thermal conductivity of these specimens at room temper-ature (25 °C) was also measured and the data were added to this/uniFB01gure.It is seen that the thermal conductivity of the specimens shows adecaying trend with increasing temperature, and the values at 150 °Crange from 5.7% to 8.7% lower than those at room temperature. Thismeans that within the used temperature range, the in/uniFB02uence of theincreasing temperature on the decay of thermal conductivity for theserocks is limited. On the other hand, a possible reason for the gradualdecrease in thermal conductivity is the generation of thermally inducedmicrocracks in the rocks because of a mismatch between thermalexpansion coef/uniFB01cients of adjacent mineral grains in a homogeneoustemperature/uniFB01eld (Jansen et al., 1993), which has been demonstrat-ed from a microcracking perspective based on numerical simulations(Zhao, 2016).

In/uniFB02uence of axial stress on the thermal conductivityUnder uniaxial compression condition, thermal conductivity mea-surements on 20 pairs of dry specimens in different rock groups wereconducted. To analyze the thermal conductivity of the tested rockswith respect to axial stress, the experimental results were plotted onthe graph as given inFig. 14a–h. It can be observed that the thermal con-ductivities of all rocks vary with increasing axial stress in a nonlinear be-havior, which is basically in agreement with the observations reportedby other researchers (Clauser and Huenges, 1995; Demırcıet al., 2004;Görgülü et al., 2008; Walsh and Decker, 1966). At the initial loadingstage, there is a rapid increase of the thermal conductivities due to clo-sure of pre-existing pores and microcracks in the rocks. In this stage, theincreasing gradient of the thermal conductivities decreases as the axialstress increases. This means that the crack closure rate and axial stiff-ness of the rocks decreases and increases gradually, respectively. Inthe subsequent loading, the increasing gradient of the thermal conduc-tivities changes little, which may represent that the elastic deformationof the rocks occurs. For each rock group, the increase rate (R) of the ther-mal conductivity can be de/uniFB01ned as:R¼\\n\\nkl−ki\\nki ð10Þwherek\\nlandkiis the thermal conductivities of the specimens at the lastcompression stress level (i.e., 45 MPa) and before loading, respectively.The ratioRis found to be dependent on rock porosity, as shown inFig. 14i. It is seen thatRpresents an increasing trend with increasingporosity. For the tested rocks,Rranges from 6.1% to 17.7%. InspectionofFigs. 10 and 14i shows that the effects of compression stress andwater saturation on the thermal conductivity are basically comparable.It should be mentioned that if the axial stress is further increased,new cracks in the rocks will be generated, propagated and coalesced.The stress-induced rock damage will result in deterioration of ther-mal conductivity (Chen et al., 2012). Hence, from low to high com-pression stress conditions, the thermal conductivity may increaseto its peak value, after which it may decrease gradually. However,the in/uniFB02uence of stress-induced damage on the thermal conductivitycharacteristics has been beyond the scope of this study.

Analysisof Eq.(11)reveals that the coef/uniFB01cientBplays a critical role in controllingthe increasing gradient of the thermal conductivity in the initial loadingstage (i.e., crack closure stage). The coef/uniFB01cientCdominantly affects theincreasing velocity of the thermal conductivity in the subsequent elasticdeformation stage. Based on experimental investigations on the ther-mal conductivity of some rocks subjected to uniaxial stresses using asteady-state apparatus developed byDemırcıet al. (2004),Görgülüet al. (2008)found that the parametersBandCdepended on the mag-nitude of elastic modulus of the rocks, and subsequently established anelastic modulus dependent model to predict the thermal conductivityvalues under pressure. Unfortunately, in the present study, the elasticmoduli of the tested rocks have not been available. Therefore, themodel proposed byGörgülü et al. (2008)cannot be used to/uniFB01t our testresults. According toFig. 14, we found that the increasing gradients ofthe thermal conductivities in the initial loading stage were generallylarge for the rocks with a high porosity such as rock groups BS05 andBS15. Hence, the coef/uniFB01cientBis associated with the rock porosityn,i.e.,Bincreases asnincreases, as presented inFig. 15a. An exponentialform expression can/uniFB01t the data reasonably, as follows:B¼0:25−0:24 exp−nðÞ ð12ÞMeanwhile, the coef/uniFB01cientCin Eq.(11)is not sensitive to the varia-tion of rock porosity, and is within the range from 0.20 to 0.27 except forthe rock group BS19-1. For simplicity, an average value ofC=0.24obtained fromTable 4is used to approximately describe the trend, asshown inFig. 15b. Using Eqs.(11)–(12)and the constant coef/uniFB01cientC,an overall/uniFB01t is made for these rock groups to reproduce the rockporosity-dependent thermal conductivity under different axial stresses.A comparison between individual and overall/uniFB01tresultsispresentedinFig. 16. It is found that for each rock group subjected to differentcompression stresses, the difference of the thermal conductivity valuesfrom the individual and overall/uniFB01ts is less than 0.05 W/mK. The goodagreement indicates that the established rock porosity-dependentmodel can capture the nonlinear stress-thermal conductivity relation-ships of the Beishan granitic rocks satisfactorily.5. DiscussionOne of the/uniFB01ndings from the experimental investigations in theprevious sections is that the rock porosity has an in/uniFB02uence on the ther-mal conductivity of the Beishan granitic rocks under water saturation,increasing temperature and compression stress conditions, althoughthe porosity of tested rocks is relatively low. It is well known that forlow-porosity crystalline rocks, the mineral composition plays an impor-tant role in dominating the thermal conductivity. The crystalline rocksare mainly made up of quartz, feldspars, and ma/uniFB01cmineralssuchaspy-roxene, amphibole and biotite, and the content of minerals from thesethree mineral groups basically determines a rock's thermal conductivity(Clauser and Huenges, 1995). As mentioned inSection 2, a model anal-ysis on a total of 46 thin sections of the rocks was conducted to identifythe dominant minerals in the rocks. As listed inTable 1, the main min-erals of these rocks include quartz, plagioclase, K-feldspar and biotite.Among these four minerals, quartz has the highest thermal conductivity(7.69 W/mK) while another three minerals have a thermal conductivityrange between 1.70 and 2.29 W/mK (Horai, 1971). Hence, when the po-rosity values of the specimens in different rock groups are close to eachother, quartz content in the rocks may determine the thermal conduc-tivity. According to the data listed inTable 2,Fig. 17a presents the in/uniFB02u-ence of quartz content on the average thermal conductivity of differentrock groups in dry state. It is seen that except for rock groups BS05 andBS15 (which have relatively large porosity values of 1.37% and 0.68%,respectively), thermal conductivity of the rocks appears an increasingtrend with increasing quartz content. When the specimens are subject-ed to compression stresses, the original pores and cracks in the rockstend to close, and the effective contact areas between mineral grainsincrease, leading to a signi/uniFB01cant decay of the porosity effect on thethermal conductivity, especially for rocks with relatively high porosity.On the other hand, the closure of pores and cracks increases the contactopportunity of quartz grains, and hence improves the transportationcapability of heat/uniFB02ow in the rocks. Under this condition, an obvious in-crease of the thermal conductivity for all rock groups with increasingquartz content can be observed, as presented inFig. 17b.6. ConclusionsBeishan granitic rocks are candidate host rock types for China's HLWrepository. In this paper, thermal conductivity characteristics of theBeishan granitic rocks have been investigated using the Transient PlaneSource (TPS) method. The measurement results indicate that for theused eight rock groups with a porosity range from 0.40% to 1.37%, the av-erage thermal conductivity valuesinthedrystaterangebetween2.412and 2.812 W/mK. The values under water-saturated condition rangefrom 2.602 to 3.156 W/mK. Meanwhile, the effect of water saturationon thermal conductivity presents an increasing trend with an increaseof rock porosity.

       " \"(i.e., geometric mean, the arithmetic mean, and the effective-mediummean) yielded similar predictions and underestimated the thermal con-ductivity of the rocks under the water-saturated condition. Future workis demanded to verify the validity of various mixing models using differ-ent rock types with a large porosity range.With increasing temperature from 25 °C to 150 °C, the thermal con-ductivity of the rocks shows a decaying trend and the values at 150 °Crange from 5.7% to 8.7% lower than those at room temperature, reveal-ing that the in/uniFB02uence of temperature on the thermal conductivity of thetested rocks is limited. In addition, the thermal conductivity of the rocksincreases with increasing compression stress in a nonlinear behavior,and the increase rate of the thermal conductivity increases with an in-crease of rock porosity. It is found that the effects of compression stressand water saturation on the magnitude of thermal conductivity of therocks are basically comparable. Based on the experimental data, theempirical models considering the in/uniFB02uence of rock porosity have beenestablished for predicting the temperature and compression stressdependent thermal conductivity characteristics of the rocks, and thepredictions are found to be in good agreement with experimental re-sults. This study thus emphasizes importance of porosity on thermalconductivity measurements even for low porosity crystalline rocks.When the pores and cracks in the rocks tend to close during com-pression, quartz content may determine the thermal conductivity, andthere exists an increase of the thermal conductivity with increasingquartz content. This is because the closure of pores and cracks increasesthe contact opportunity of quartz grains, and hence improves the trans-portation capability of heat/uniFB02ow in the rocks. While the test results pro-vide insights into the thermal conductivity characteristics of Beishangranitic rocks, one should be aware of the limitation of this study.Because the thermal conductivity of granitic rocks is in/uniFB02uenced bymany factors. In order to better understand the thermal conductivityof granitic rocks related to rock characteristics such as rock fabric,grain shape, grain contact and grain size, comprehensive petrographicinvestigations are recommended in the future. In the meantime, studiesshould be carried out to understand how the interactions between min-eral components affect the thermal conductivity. Work is also beingconducted to investigate the thermal conductivity of the rocks undercoupled thermal-hydro-mechanical conditions.AcknowledgmentsThis work has been supported by the China Atomic Energy Authoritythrough the geological disposal program and the National NaturalScience Foundation of China (Grant no. 11102061).

A better understanding of thermal conductivity of rocks is essential to safe evaluation and engineer-\\ning optimization of a HLW disposal system in the rock at depth. In the present study, experimental investigations\\non the thermal conductivity characteristics of 47 pairs of granitic rock specimens were conducted using the\\nTransient Plane Source (TPS) method. The specimens were collected from borehole cores in the Beishan area,\\nwhich is being considered as the most potential candidate area for China's HLW repository. To evaluate geological\\nnature of the rocks, mineralogical compositions of the rocks were identiﬁed, and porosity of the specimens was\\nmeasured. The thermal conductivities of the specimens under dry and water-saturated conditions were\\ndetermined, and the effect of water saturation on the thermal conductivity was investigated. In addition, the\\ninﬂuence of temperature and axial compression stress on the thermal conductivity of dry specimens was studied.\\nThe results revealed that the thermal conductivity of tested rocks was dependent on water saturation, tempera-\\nture and compression stress. Based on the obtained data, some models considering porosity were established for\\ndescribing the thermal conductivity characteristics of the tested rocks. Furthermore, when the rocks have a\\nsimilar porosity, the quartz content dominates the thermal conductivity, and there exists an obvious increase\\nof the thermal conductivity with increasing quartz content. The test results constitute the ﬁrst systematic\\nmeasurements on the Beishan granitic rocks and can further be used for the development of thermal models\\nfor predicting thermal response near the underground excavations for HLW disposal.\\n\\n© 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Introduction\\n\\nDeep geological disposal has been the internationally accepted\\napproach for the permanent disposal of high level radioactive waste\\n(HLW) generated from nuclear power plants and other nuclear facili-\\nties. An HLW repository can be constructed in a host rock at a depth of\\nseveral hundred meters below the ground surface. The design of HLW\\nrepositories often relies on a multi-barrier system, which typically con-\\nsists of the natural geological barrier and an engineered barrier system.\\nAs the last defense to the biosphere, the natural geological barrier\\n(i.e., the host rock) plays a critical role in ensuring the long-term safety\\nof the HLW repositories. Because crystalline rocks such as granite and\\ndiorite have low permeability, high solidity, and good excavation stabil-\\nity, they have been considered as potential HLW repository formations\\nin some countries (Hudson et al., 2011; Wang, 2014). Site selection for\\nChina's HLW repository started in 1985 (Wang, 2010). The efforts\\nhave been focused on potential HLW repository sites located within\\ngranite intrusions in mainland China. Since 1999, the Beijing Research\\n\\n⁎ Corresponding author.\\n\\nE-mail address: xingguang100@126.com (X.G.

So far, the Beishan area has\\nbeen considered as the most potential candidate area for China's\\nHLW repository.\\n\\nAmong all the engineering properties of crystalline rocks at a\\npotential HLW repository site, the thermal conductivity is one of\\nthe most important parameters in design consideration because it\\nhas a direct impact on the evaluation of the necessary repository vol-\\nume and the optimization of the repository layout (Sundberg and\\nHellström, 2009). For instance, in the Swedish KBS-3 concept for\\ngeological disposal of spent fuel, copper canisters with cast iron\\ninserts containing the spent fuel are surrounded by bentonite for iso-\\nlation and mechanical protection (Brantberger et al., 2006). The heat\\ngenerated by the spent fuel will increase the temperature of all com-\\nponents of the repository. For the bentonite buffer outside the canis-\\nters, the peak temperature must not exceed 100 °C. This requirement\\nimplies that the canisters cannot be deposited arbitrarily close to\\neach other. On the other hand, unnecessarily large distances\\nbetween the canisters will mean inefﬁcient and costly use of the\\nrepository rock volume (Hökmark et al., 2009). To fulﬁll the temper-\\nature requirement, the rocks with low thermal conductivities will\\n\\n\\x0cX.G. Zhao et al. / Tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137\\n\\n125\\n\\nlead to a larger distance between canisters than for a case with\\nhigh thermal conductivities. This is because the rocks with low\\nthermal conductivities will give rise to higher temperatures in the\\nbentonite (Sundberg et al., 2008). Hence, to design and construct\\nrepositories successfully, it is essential to perform an accurate as-\\nsessment of the thermal conductivity characteristics of the host rock.\\nOver the past few decades, various experimental approaches have\\nbeen employed to measure the thermal conductivity of rocks. The re-\\nsults indicate that the thermal conductivity of rocks is closely associated\\nwith mineral composition, porosity, texture, and density, etc. (Birch and\\nClark, 1940; Clauser and Huenges, 1995; Hartmann et al., 2005;\\nÖzkahraman et al., 2004; Pasquale et al., 2015; Ray et al., 2007;\\nSundberg et al., 2009). For crystalline rocks with relatively homoge-\\nneous texture and low porosity, the mineral composition dominates\\nthe thermal conductivity. In volcanic and sedimentary rocks, the high\\nvariability of porosity in these rocks is a major factor controlling the\\nthermal conductivity (Clauser and Huenges, 1995; Özkahraman et al.,\\n2004). For example, increasing porosity, which acts as barrier to the\\nﬂow of heat, often results in both lower P-wave velocity and lower\\nthermal conductivity values (Özkahraman et al., 2004). For a given\\nrock, water content and temperature have an inﬂuence on its thermal\\nconductivity. Generally, the thermal conductivity of the rock increases\\nand decreases with increasing water content (Cho and Kwon, 2010;\\nCho et al., 2009) and temperature (Abdulagatova et al., 2009; Birch\\nand Clark, 1940; Heuze, 1983; Miao et al., 2014; Mottaghy et al., 2008;\\nVosteen and Schellschmidt, 2003), respectively. Moreover, the effect\\nof water saturation on the thermal conductivity of rocks shows a gener-\\nally increasing trend with increasing porosity (Nagaraju and Roy, 2014).\\nGiven that the thermal conductivity of surrounding rocks around\\nthe excavations will be changed by the excavation-induced stress,\\nsome researchers studied the inﬂuence of pressure on the thermal\\nconductivity of rocks (Abdulagatova et al., 2010; Abdulagatova et al.,\\n2009; Demırcı et al., 2004; Görgülü et al., 2008; Sibbitt, 1976; Walsh\\nand Decker, 1966; Zimmerman, 1989). One of the main ﬁndings\\nachieved from these investigations shows that the thermal conductivity\\n\\nvaries with the pressure exerted on the rock. With increasing applied\\npressure, the thermal conductivity starts to increase and subsequently\\nthe increase rate tends to be a constant value due to gradual closure\\nof cracks and pores within the rock (Görgülü et al., 2008; Walsh and\\nDecker, 1966).\\n\\nWhile the above-mentioned studies provide meaningful insight into\\nthe thermal conductivity of various rocks, the thermal conductivity\\ncharacteristics of low-porosity crystalline rocks subjected to different\\nexternal factors such as water saturation, temperature and compression\\nstress have not been fully understood. On the other hand, the informa-\\ntion on the thermal conductivity of rocks in a potential HLW repository\\nsite must be known with sufﬁcient conﬁdence to provide necessary\\ninput conditions for its long-term safety assessment, which is one of\\nthe motivations for this study. In this work, experimental investigations\\non the thermal conductivity of the Beishan granitic rocks are conducted\\nusing the Transient Plane Source (TPS) method. In the following\\ndiscussion, rock sampling and basic physical properties of the rock\\nspecimens are introduced ﬁrst. Testing facilities and procedures are\\nthen described. Subsequently, the water saturation, temperature and\\ncompression stress dependent thermal conductivity characteristics of\\nthe tested rocks are evaluated comprehensively, and ﬁnally some\\ninsights are obtained.\\n\\n2. Rock sampling and preparation\\n\\nThe Beishan area is situated in Gansu Province of northwestern\\nChina (see Fig. 1). After a long geological evolution and weathering\\nprocess, the topography of this area is characterized by a ﬂat Gobi and\\nsmall gentle rolling hills with elevations ranging between 1400 and\\n2000 m above the sea level. The crust in this area possesses a blocky\\nstructure with many granite intrusions (see Fig. 2). Other surrounding\\nrocks include mainly metamorphic and sedimentary rocks, as well as\\nQuaternary cover. Rock sampling was carried out in the Jijicao and\\nXinchang rock blocks, which are currently considered as two of the\\nkey investigation sub-areas during site selection and characterization.\\n\\nFig. 1.

Rock sampling from six boreholes in the Jijicao and Xinchang sub-areas for thermal conductivity measurements.\\n\\nIntact drill cores with a diameter of approximately 63 mm were taken\\nfrom six sub-vertical boreholes (i.e., boreholes BS05, BS06, BS15, BS16,\\nBS18 and BS19) in these two sub-areas. The borehole locations are\\npresented in Fig. 2.\\n\\nField observations indicated that the collected granitic rocks\\nwere relatively isotropic in texture and mineralogical composition. To\\nevaluate the geological nature of the rocks, a series of thin sections\\nwere prepared and then exposed to cross-polarized light under an\\noptical microscope to identify the dominant minerals in the rocks. The\\npercentages of the dominant minerals were determined by point\\ncounting on thin sections. For each thin section approximately 500\\npoints covering phenocrysts and groundmass were counted. According\\nto the quartz-alkali feldspar-plagioclase (QAP) diagram (Streckeisen,\\n1976), the rocks can further be classiﬁed. It can be observed from\\nFig. 3 that the rocks contain mainly a moderate to low amount of quartz\\nand alkali feldspar, and a moderate to high amount of plagioclase. This\\nmeans that the collected rocks dominantly range from granodiorite to\\nmonzogranite. For grain size characteristics, the rocks are from ﬁne\\ngrained to, medium to coarse grained. An overview of the basic informa-\\ntion of the rocks is listed in Table 1. Based on the borehole no. and\\nsampling depth, these rocks have been divided into eight groups.\\n\\nA total of 47 pairs of rock specimens, 50 mm in diameter, were\\nprepared from the drill cores with a length to diameter ratio of approx-\\nimately 0.5.

Test methodology\\n\\n3.1. An introduction to the used TPS method\\n\\nIn the ﬁelds of geology and geophysics, laboratory approaches to\\nmeasuring soil and rock thermal conductivity can mainly be divided\\ninto two groups: steady state and transient state. In this work, the\\nTransient Plane Source (TPS) method (Gustafsson, 1991; Log and\\nGustafsson, 1995) was utilized to measure the thermal conductivity of\\nthe specimens. As one of the transient measurement methods, the TPS\\ntechnique is based on the use of a transiently heated plane sensor\\n(i.e., Hot Disk sensor) and a Hot Disk Thermal Constants Analyser (see\\nFig. 4a). The used Hot Disk TPS2500S system can measure thermal\\nconductivity of materials ranging from 0.01 to 400 W/mK. The Hot\\nDisk sensor consists of a continuous double spiral, which is etched out\\nof a thin nickel foil (Fig. 4e). This spiral is sandwiched between two\\nsheets of electrical insulation materials made of Kapton. The sensor\\nacts both as a heat source for increasing the temperature of the speci-\\nmens and as a dynamic temperature sensor for recording the tempera-\\nture increase. During the measurement, the temperature in the sensor\\nrises and heat starts to ﬂow to the specimens. The temperature rise in\\nthe sensor provides an indicator of the thermal properties of the speci-\\nmens. If the specimens have good thermal conducting properties, the\\nheat will be transported rapidly inside the specimens. On the contrary,\\nif the specimens have good thermal insulation properties, the sensor\\ntemperature will rise faster and the heat will not be transported\\nas much as in the test of the good thermal conducting specimens.\\nCompared with steady state measurement methods such as the divided\\nbar (Beck and Beck, 1958; Birch, 1950; Sass et al., 1971) and the guarded\\nhot plate (Abdulagatova et al., 2009; Alishaev et al., 2012), one of signif-\\nicant advantages of the TPS technique is that the thermal conductivity of\\nmaterials can be measured more quickly, typically from several to tens\\nof seconds. Hence, a long wait for thermal gradients to equilibrate is\\nnot required and the moisture migration in response to temperature\\ngradients was minimized (Jackson and Taylor, 1986). On the other\\nhand, unlike some transient methods such as thermal needle probes\\n(Barry-Macaulay et al., 2013; Von Herzen and Maxwell, 1959), which\\nare commonly used for soils and soft rocks, the TPS method can be\\n\\n\\x0cX.G.

Theory of the TPS technique\\n\\nTo theoretically describe how the TPS method behaves, the\\nthermal conductivity equation can be solved assuming that the Hot\\nDisk sensor consists of a certain number of concentric ring heat\\nsources located in an inﬁnitely large sample (Hot Disk, 2007). A con-\\nstant electric power supplied to the sensor results in an increase in\\ntemperature which is directly related to the variation in the sensor\\nresistance (R(t)) by the equation:\\n\\n\\x10\\n\\n\\x11\\nR tð Þ ¼ R0 1 þ αΔT τð Þ\\n\\nð1Þ\\n\\nwhere R0 is the nickel electrical resistance in the beginning of the\\nrecording, α is the temperature coefﬁcient of resistance of the nickel\\nfoil, and ΔTðτÞ is the mean value of temperature rise in the sensor due\\nto a constant current pulse given by:\\n\\n\\x10\\n\\nΔT τð Þ ¼ P0 π3=2ak\\n\\n\\x11−1D τð Þ\\n\\nð2Þ\\n\\nwhere P0 is the total output of power from the sensor, a is the sensor\\nradius, k is the thermal conductivity of the sample that is being\\ntested and D(τ) is a dimensionless time dependent function with:\\nτ ¼ t=θð\\nð3Þ\\n\\nÞ1=2; θ ¼ a2=d\\n\\nwhere t is the time measured from the start of the transient\\nrecording, θ is the characteristic time, which depends both on\\nparameters of the sensor and the sample, and d is the thermal\\ndiffusivity of the sample.\\n\\nAccording to Eq. (2), and ΔTðτÞ and D(τ) plotted as a function of τ\\nprovides a linear relationship with a slope that is a function of P0, a,\\nand k. Thermal conductivity k can be obtained by ﬁtting the experimen-\\ntal data to the straight line given by Eq. (2); thermal diffusivity d is cal-\\nculated from Eq. (3) taking into account the τ value determined in the\\nprevious ﬁt.\\n\\nAs mentioned above, the solution of the thermal conductivity\\nequation is based on the assumption that the Hot Disk sensor is located\\nin an inﬁnite material in perfect contact with the sensor surface.\\nThis means that the heat ﬂow generated from each measurement\\nmust not reach the outside boundaries of the specimen (Hot Disk,\\n2007). Meanwhile, a careful preparation of specimen ends is required\\nto minimize thermal contact resistance. An estimation of how far the\\nheat ﬂow has proceeded in the specimen during a recording is the\\nprobing depth Δp, which is deﬁned as (Hot Disk, 2007):\\n\\nﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ\\np\\ndt\\n\\nΔp ¼ 2\\n\\nð4Þ\\n\\nTo determine the thermal conductivity with good accuracy, the\\nshortest distance from any part of the sensor to the nearest outside\\nboundary of the sample should be larger than Δp. In our experiments,\\nthe used Hot Disk sensor has a radius of 6.403 mm. The shortest distance\\nis about 19 mm, and the probing depth is approximately 10 mm.

Our tests revealed that the mass of\\nthe specimens could be approximately constant under vacuum within\\n72 h (see Fig. 5), indicating that the specimens were saturated with\\nwater. Subsequently, the Hot Disk sensor was horizontally placed be-\\ntween the two saturated specimen pieces with the double spiral\\ncentered and totally covered, and the two specimen pieces were ﬁrmly\\nclamped together to ensure that there was no air gap between the\\nsensor and the specimen end surfaces, as presented in Fig. 4d. In order\\nto remain water saturation, the saturated specimens and the sensor\\nwere kept in a plastic bag during thermal conductivity measurement\\n(Adl-Zarrabi, 2004). After the test, the used water-saturated specimens\\nwere suffered from dehydration treatment in a thermostatic drying\\noven at 105 °C for a period of 24 h and subsequently cooled in a\\ndesiccator to measure the thermal conductivity under a dry condition.\\nMeanwhile, the mass of the dry specimens (Mdry) was measured, and\\nthe porosity (n) of the specimens was calculated using the equations\\n\\nn ¼ 100V p\\n\\nV %\\n\\nV p ¼ Msat − Mdry\\n\\nρw\\n\\nð5Þ\\n\\nð6Þ\\n\\nwhere V is the bulk rock volume, Vp is the pore volume, and ρw is the\\ndensity of water. For each pair of specimens saturated or dried,\\nmeasurements on the thermal conductivity were carried out at room\\ntemperature (25 ± 1 °C).\\n\\n3.3.2. Tests on specimens under increasing temperature\\n\\nTo investigate the effect of temperature on the thermal conductivity\\nof the tested rocks, measurements were performed on dry specimens\\nfrom 40 °C to 150 °C based on the requirements of the used test\\nequipment. Compared with measurements at room temperature, the\\nexperiments under high temperature are time consuming due to a\\nslow stepwise heating process by using a constant temperature oil\\nbath and a temperature control system, as shown in Fig. 4c. The thermal\\nconductivity measurement can only be conducted until the two speci-\\nmen pieces in the chamber with a specimen holder within the oil bath\\nhave reached thermal equilibrium and kept a target temperature\\nvalue. During thermal equilibrium of the oil bath, the Hot Disk sensor\\nmonitors continuously the temperature variation of the specimens.\\nFor our tests, the thermal conductivity of the specimens was measured\\nwhen the recorded temperature variation of the specimens is less than\\n0.04 °C. In general, 32 h were needed to complete one test. A typical\\ntemperature-time history during the test is presented in Fig. 6.

The thermal conductivity measurement was performed at\\neach incremental stress level. After each measurement, the load\\nwas maintained constant for a period of about 15 min to avoid resid-\\nual temperature drifts on the specimens. Based on the in-situ stress\\nmeasurement results obtained from the Beishan area (Zhao et al.,\\n2013), the maximum axial compression stress applied to the\\nspecimens was set to be 45 MPa to approximately simulate the\\nexcavation-induced stress near the vertical HLW disposal element\\nboundary at a depth of 600 m. The axial stress applied to the speci-\\nmens was recorded automatically, and the used stress path through-\\nout the course of testing is presented in Fig. 7. The experiments were\\nconducted at room temperature.\\n\\nAccording to previous experimental results (Zhao et al., 2015a; Zhao\\net al., 2015b), the identiﬁed crack initiation stresses of cylindrical spec-\\nimens of Beishan granitic rocks under uniaxial compression using the\\ncumulative AE hit (CAEH) method range from 45.3 to 109.1 MPa,\\nwhich are larger than the maximum compression stress adopted in\\nthe present study. Hence, the stress-induced rock damage might not\\noccur in the tested specimens during loading. It should be mentioned\\nthat in the process of loading, the friction may occur at the interfaces\\nbetween the specimen ends and the sensor. Due to limitation of the\\nTPS measurement technique, the utilized test method does not consider\\nthe potential inﬂuence of interface friction effect on the experimental\\nresults. To reduce or eliminate the friction effect, further efforts are\\nneeded to produce innovative design for the test equipment. Although\\nnot perfect, the developed test system provides a feasible means\\nfor us to gain insight into thermal conductivity behaviors of rocks\\nunder compression.\\n\\n4. Test results\\n\\n4.1.

The thermal conductivity of these specimens at room temper-\\nature (25 °C) was also measured and the data were added to this ﬁgure.\\nIt is seen that the thermal conductivity of the specimens shows a\\ndecaying trend with increasing temperature, and the values at 150 °C\\nrange from 5.7% to 8.7% lower than those at room temperature. This\\nmeans that within the used temperature range, the inﬂuence of the\\nincreasing temperature on the decay of thermal conductivity for these\\nrocks is limited. On the other hand, a possible reason for the gradual\\ndecrease in thermal conductivity is the generation of thermally induced\\nmicrocracks in the rocks because of a mismatch between thermal\\nexpansion coefﬁcients of adjacent mineral grains in a homogeneous\\ntemperature ﬁeld (Jansen et al., 1993), which has been demonstrat-\\ned from a microcracking perspective based on numerical simulations\\n(Zhao, 2016). Based on the experimental data, the relationship\\nbetween thermal conductivity and temperature can be described\\nusing the equation:\\nk ¼ kr − AT2\\n\\nð8Þ\\n\\nwhere kr is the thermal conductivity of the rock at room temperature\\n(25 °C), T is the temperature in Celsius, and A is the ﬁt coefﬁcient (see\\nTable 3). The parameter A affects the decaying velocity of the thermal\\nconductivity with the temperature, i.e., the decaying velocity of the\\nthermal conductivity increases as A increases.

However, with further increase of rock porosity, the approxi-\\nmately linear relationship between kdry and ksat is not valid anymore. For\\nexample, the rock groups BS05 and BS15 with average porosity values\\ngreater than or equal to 0.68% exhibit higher thermal conductivity in\\nthe water-saturated state relative to the dry state.\\n\\nTo evaluate the thermal conductivity of rocks, various mixing\\nmodels such as the geometric mean (Lichtenecker, 1924), the arithmet-\\nic mean (Voigt, 1928), the Hashin–Shtrikman mean (Hashin and\\nShtrikman, 1962), and the effective-medium mean (Bruggeman, 1935;\\nClauser, 2009) have been proposed. Comprehensive overviews and\\ncase studies on such mixing models can be found in (Abdulagatova\\net al., 2009; Clauser, 2009; Fuchs et al., 2013; Hartmann, 2005; Ray\\net al., 2015). Based on the experimental data (see Table 2) in combina-\\ntion with the methodology used by Fuchs et al. (2013), the above-\\nmentioned mixing models were used to predict the thermal conductiv-\\nity values of the tested rocks in the water-saturated state. Fig. 9 shows\\nthe comparison between measured and calculated thermal conductivi-\\nties for the four different models. It can be observed from Fig. 9a, b, and d\\nthat the geometric mean, the arithmetic mean, and the effective-\\nmedium mean yield similar prediction results and consistently underes-\\ntimate the thermal conductivity of the eight rock groups, especially for\\nthe groups with relatively high porosity values (e.g., groups BS05 and\\nBS15). The Hashin–Shtrikman mean shows a reasonably good ﬁt for\\nall rock groups, as shown in Fig. 9c. The analysis results are basically in\\nline with observations reported by Fuchs et al. (2013) because most of\\nthe evaluated mixing models used in their analysis also underestimate\\nthe thermal conductivity of the rocks. However, the geometric mean\\nmodel was rated as the best ﬁt to their data set. It should be noted\\nthat the rocks used in their analysis covered different rock types with\\na large range in porosity, from almost zero to about 30%. In addition,\\nthe measured thermal conductivity values of these rocks spans the in-\\nterval between 1.0 and 6.5 W/mK.

Inﬂuence of axial stress on the thermal conductivity\\n\\nUnder uniaxial compression condition, thermal conductivity mea-\\nsurements on 20 pairs of dry specimens in different rock groups were\\nconducted. To analyze the thermal conductivity of the tested rocks\\nwith respect to axial stress, the experimental results were plotted on\\nthe graph as given in Fig. 14a–h. It can be observed that the thermal con-\\nductivities of all rocks vary with increasing axial stress in a nonlinear be-\\nhavior, which is basically in agreement with the observations reported\\nby other researchers (Clauser and Huenges, 1995; Demırcı et al., 2004;\\nGörgülü et al., 2008; Walsh and Decker, 1966). At the initial loading\\nstage, there is a rapid increase of the thermal conductivities due to clo-\\nsure of pre-existing pores and microcracks in the rocks. In this stage, the\\nincreasing gradient of the thermal conductivities decreases as the axial\\nstress increases. This means that the crack closure rate and axial stiff-\\nness of the rocks decreases and increases gradually, respectively. In\\nthe subsequent loading, the increasing gradient of the thermal conduc-\\ntivities changes little, which may represent that the elastic deformation\\nof the rocks occurs. For each rock group, the increase rate (R) of the ther-\\nmal conductivity can be deﬁned as:\\n\\nR ¼ kl − ki\\nki\\n\\nð10Þ\\n\\nwhere kl and ki is the thermal conductivities of the specimens at the last\\ncompression stress level (i.e., 45 MPa) and before loading, respectively.\\nThe ratio R is found to be dependent on rock porosity, as shown in\\nFig. 14i. It is seen that R presents an increasing trend with increasing\\n\\n134\\n\\nX.G.

(11) is not sensitive to the varia-\\ntion of rock porosity, and is within the range from 0.20 to 0.27 except for\\nthe rock group BS19-1. For simplicity, an average value of C = 0.24\\nobtained from Table 4 is used to approximately describe the trend, as\\nshown in Fig. 15b. Using Eqs. (11)–(12) and the constant coefﬁcient C,\\nan overall ﬁt is made for these rock groups to reproduce the rock\\nporosity-dependent thermal conductivity under different axial stresses.\\nA comparison between individual and overall ﬁt results is presented in\\nFig. 16. It is found that for each rock group subjected to different\\ncompression stresses, the difference of the thermal conductivity values\\nfrom the individual and overall ﬁts is less than 0.05 W/mK. The good\\nagreement indicates that the established rock porosity-dependent\\nmodel can capture the nonlinear stress-thermal conductivity relation-\\nships of the Beishan granitic rocks satisfactorily.\\n\\n5. Discussion\\n\\nOne of the ﬁndings from the experimental investigations in the\\nprevious sections is that the rock porosity has an inﬂuence on the ther-\\nmal conductivity of the Beishan granitic rocks under water saturation,\\nincreasing temperature and compression stress conditions, although\\nthe porosity of tested rocks is relatively low. It is well known that for\\nlow-porosity crystalline rocks, the mineral composition plays an impor-\\ntant role in dominating the thermal conductivity. The crystalline rocks\\nare mainly made up of quartz, feldspars, and maﬁc minerals such as py-\\nroxene, amphibole and biotite, and the content of minerals from these\\nthree mineral groups basically determines a rock's thermal conductivity\\n(Clauser and Huenges, 1995). As mentioned in Section 2, a model anal-\\nysis on a total of 46 thin sections of the rocks was conducted to identify\\nthe dominant minerals in the rocks. As listed in Table 1, the main min-\\nerals of these rocks include quartz, plagioclase, K-feldspar and biotite.\\nAmong these four minerals, quartz has the highest thermal conductivity\\n(7.69 W/mK) while another three minerals have a thermal conductivity\\nrange between 1.70 and 2.29 W/mK (Horai, 1971). Hence, when the po-\\nrosity values of the specimens in different rock groups are close to each\\nother, quartz content in the rocks may determine the thermal conduc-\\ntivity. According to the data listed in Table 2, Fig. 17a presents the inﬂu-\\nence of quartz content on the average thermal conductivity of different\\nrock groups in dry state. It is seen that except for rock groups BS05 and\\nBS15 (which have relatively large porosity values of 1.37% and 0.68%,\\nrespectively), thermal conductivity of the rocks appears an increasing\\ntrend with increasing quartz content. When the specimens are subject-\\ned to compression stresses, the original pores and cracks in the rocks\\ntend to close, and the effective contact areas between mineral grains\\nincrease, leading to a signiﬁcant decay of the porosity effect on the\\nthermal conductivity, especially for rocks with relatively high porosity.\\nOn the other hand, the closure of pores and cracks increases the contact\\nopportunity of quartz grains, and hence improves the transportation\\ncapability of heat ﬂow in the rocks. Under this condition, an obvious in-\\ncrease of the thermal conductivity for all rock groups with increasing\\nquartz content can be observed, as presented in Fig. 17b.\\n\\n6. Conclusions\\n\\nBeishan granitic rocks are candidate host rock types for China's HLW\\nrepository. In this paper, thermal conductivity characteristics of the\\nBeishan granitic rocks have been investigated using the Transient Plane\\nSource (TPS) method. The measurement results indicate that for the\\nused eight rock groups with a porosity range from 0.40% to 1.37%, the av-\\nerage thermal conductivity values in the dry state range between 2.412\\nand 2.812 W/mK. The values under water-saturated condition range\\nfrom 2.602 to 3.156 W/mK. Meanwhile, the effect of water saturation\\non thermal conductivity presents an increasing trend with an increase\\nof rock porosity. Using several mixing models proposed by previous re-\\nsearchers, we found that the Hashin–Shtrikman mean model showed a\\nreasonably good ﬁt to the experimental data while another three models\\n\\ncurrently obtained data, a best ﬁtting equation of axial stress-\\ndependent thermal conductivity for these rocks can be expressed\\nas (Demırcı et al., 2004)\\nk ¼ k0 þ Bσ C\\n\\nð11Þ\\n\\n1\\n\\nwhere k0 is the thermal conductivity of the rock at zero stress, σ1 is the\\naxial stress, and B and C are ﬁt coefﬁcients, as listed in Table 4. Analysis\\nof Eq. (11) reveals that the coefﬁcient B plays a critical role in controlling\\nthe increasing gradient of the thermal conductivity in the initial loading\\nstage (i.e., crack closure stage). The coefﬁcient C dominantly affects the\\nincreasing velocity of the thermal conductivity in the subsequent elastic\\ndeformation stage. Based on experimental investigations on the ther-\\nmal conductivity of some rocks subjected to uniaxial stresses using a\\nsteady-state apparatus developed by Demırcı et al. (2004), Görgülü\\net al. (2008) found that the parameters B and C depended on the mag-\\nnitude of elastic modulus of the rocks, and subsequently established an\\nelastic modulus dependent model to predict the thermal conductivity\\nvalues under pressure. Unfortunately, in the present study, the elastic\\nmoduli of the tested rocks have not been available. Therefore, the\\nmodel proposed by Görgülü et al. (2008) cannot be used to ﬁt our test\\nresults. According to Fig. 14, we found that the increasing gradients of\\nthe thermal conductivities in the initial loading stage were generally\\nlarge for the rocks with a high porosity such as rock groups BS05 and\\nBS15. Hence, the coefﬁcient B is associated with the rock porosity n,\\ni.e., B increases as n increases, as presented in Fig. 15a.

Future work\\nis demanded to verify the validity of various mixing models using differ-\\nent rock types with a large porosity range.\\n\\nWith increasing temperature from 25 °C to 150 °C, the thermal con-\\nductivity of the rocks shows a decaying trend and the values at 150 °C\\nrange from 5.7% to 8.7% lower than those at room temperature, reveal-\\ning that the inﬂuence of temperature on the thermal conductivity of the\\ntested rocks is limited. In addition, the thermal conductivity of the rocks\\nincreases with increasing compression stress in a nonlinear behavior,\\nand the increase rate of the thermal conductivity increases with an in-\\ncrease of rock porosity. It is found that the effects of compression stress\\nand water saturation on the magnitude of thermal conductivity of the\\nrocks are basically comparable. Based on the experimental data, the\\nempirical models considering the inﬂuence of rock porosity have been\\nestablished for predicting the temperature and compression stress\\ndependent thermal conductivity characteristics of the rocks, and the\\npredictions are found to be in good agreement with experimental re-\\nsults. This study thus emphasizes importance of porosity on thermal\\nconductivity measurements even for low porosity crystalline rocks.\\n\\nWhen the pores and cracks in the rocks tend to close during com-\\npression, quartz content may determine the thermal conductivity, and\\nthere exists an increase of the thermal conductivity with increasing\\nquartz content. This is because the closure of pores and cracks increases\\nthe contact opportunity of quartz grains, and hence improves the trans-\\nportation capability of heat ﬂow in the rocks. While the test results pro-\\nvide insights into the thermal conductivity characteristics of Beishan\\ngranitic rocks, one should be aware of the limitation of this study.\\nBecause the thermal conductivity of granitic rocks is inﬂuenced by\\nmany factors. In order to better understand the thermal conductivity\\nof granitic rocks related to rock characteristics such as rock fabric,\\ngrain shape, grain contact and grain size, comprehensive petrographic\\ninvestigations are recommended in the future. In the meantime, studies\\nshould be carried out to understand how the interactions between min-\\neral components affect the thermal conductivity.

conductivity of rocks is essential to safe evaluation and engineering optimization of a hlw disposal system in the rock at depth. in the present study, experimental investigations\\non the thermal conductivity characteristics of 47 pairs of granitic rock specimens were conducted using the\\ntransient plane source (tps) method. the specimens were collected from borehole cores in the beishan area,\\nwhich is being considered as the most potential candidate area for china's hlw repository. to evaluate geological\\nnature of the rocks, mineralogical compositions of the rocks were identiﬁed, and porosity of the specimens was\\nmeasured. the thermal conductivities of the specimens under dry and water-saturated conditions were\\ndetermined, and the effect of water saturation on the thermal conductivity was investigated. in addition, the\\ninﬂuence of temperature and axial compression stress on the thermal conductivity of dry specimens was studied.\\nthe results revealed that the thermal conductivity of tested rocks was dependent on water saturation, temperature and compression stress. based on the obtained data, some models considering porosity were established for\\ndescribing the thermal conductivity characteristics of the tested rocks. furthermore, when the rocks have a\\nsimilar porosity, the quartz content dominates the thermal conductivity, and there exists an obvious increase\\nof the thermal conductivity with increasing quartz content. the test results constitute the ﬁrst systematic\\nmeasurements on the beishan granitic rocks and can further be used for the development of thermal models\\nfor predicting thermal response near the underground excavations for hlw disposal.\\n\\n© 2016 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.\\n\\n1. introduction\\n\\ndeep geological disposal has been the internationally accepted\\napproach for the permanent disposal of high level radioactive waste\\n(hlw) generated from nuclear power plants and other nuclear facilities. an hlw repository can be constructed in a host rock at a depth of\\nseveral hundred meters below the ground surface. the design of hlw\\nrepositories often relies on a multi-barrier system, which typically consists of the natural geological barrier and an engineered barrier system.\\nas the last defense to the biosphere, the natural geological barrier\\n(i.e., the host rock) plays a critical role in ensuring the long-term safety\\nof the hlw repositories. because crystalline rocks such as granite and\\ndiorite have low permeability, high solidity, and good excavation stability, they have been considered as potential hlw repository formations\\nin some countries (hudson et al., 2011; wang, 2014). site selection for\\nchina's hlw repository started in 1985 (wang, 2010). the efforts\\nhave been focused on potential hlw repository sites located within\\ngranite intrusions in mainland china. since 1999, the beijing research\\n\\n⁎ corresponding

geology (briug) has performed site characterization studies in the beishan area, china. so far, the beishan area has\\nbeen considered as the most potential candidate area for china's\\nhlw repository.\\n\\namong all the engineering properties of crystalline rocks at a\\npotential hlw repository site, the thermal conductivity is one of\\nthe most important parameters in design consideration because it\\nhas a direct impact on the evaluation of the necessary repository volume and the optimization of the repository layout (sundberg and\\nhellström, 2009). for instance, in the swedish kbs-3 concept for\\ngeological disposal of spent fuel, copper canisters with cast iron\\ninserts containing the spent fuel are surrounded by bentonite for isolation and mechanical protection (brantberger et al., 2006). the heat\\ngenerated by the spent fuel will increase the temperature of all components of the repository. for the bentonite buffer outside the canisters, the peak temperature must not exceed 100 °c. this requirement\\nimplies that the canisters cannot be deposited arbitrarily close to\\neach other. on the other hand, unnecessarily large distances\\nbetween the canisters will mean inefﬁcient and costly use of the\\nrepository rock volume (hökmark et al., 2009). to fulﬁll the temperature requirement, the rocks with low thermal conductivities will\\n\\n\\x0cx.g. zhao et al. / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137\\n\\n125\\n\\nlead to a larger distance between canisters than for a case with\\nhigh thermal conductivities. this is because the rocks with low\\nthermal conductivities will give rise to higher temperatures in the\\nbentonite (sundberg et al., 2008). hence, to design and construct\\nrepositories successfully, it is essential to perform an accurate assessment of the thermal conductivity characteristics of the host rock.\\nover the past few decades, various experimental approaches have\\nbeen employed to measure the thermal conductivity of rocks. the results indicate that the thermal conductivity of rocks is closely associated\\nwith mineral composition, porosity, texture, and density, etc. (birch and\\nclark, 1940; clauser and huenges, 1995; hartmann et al., 2005;\\nözkahraman et al., 2004; pasquale et al., 2015; ray et al., 2007;\\nsundberg et al., 2009). for crystalline rocks with relatively homogeneous texture and low porosity, the mineral composition dominates\\nthe thermal conductivity. in volcanic and sedimentary rocks, the high\\nvariability of porosity in these rocks is a major factor controlling the\\nthermal conductivity (clauser and huenges, 1995; özkahraman et al.,\\n2004). for example, increasing porosity, which acts as barrier to the\\nﬂow of heat, often results in both lower p-wave velocity and lower\\nthermal conductivity values (özkahraman et al., 2004). for a given\\nrock, water content and temperature have an inﬂuence on its thermal\\nconductivity. generally, the thermal conductivity of the rock increases\\nand decreases with increasing water content (cho and kwon, 2010;\\ncho et al., 2009) and temperature (abdulagatova et al., 2009; birch\\nand clark, 1940; heuze, 1983; miao et al., 2014; mottaghy et al., 2008;\\nvosteen and schellschmidt, 2003), respectively. moreover, the effect\\nof water saturation on the thermal conductivity of rocks shows a generally increasing trend with increasing porosity (nagaraju and roy, 2014).\\ngiven that the thermal conductivity of surrounding rocks around\\nthe excavations will be changed by the excavation-induced stress,\\nsome researchers studied the inﬂuence of pressure on the thermal\\nconductivity of rocks (abdulagatova et al., 2010; abdulagatova et al.,\\n2009; demırcı et al., 2004; görgülü et al., 2008; sibbitt, 1976; walsh\\nand decker, 1966; zimmerman, 1989). one of the main ﬁndings\\nachieved from these investigations shows that the thermal conductivity\\n\\nvaries with the pressure exerted on the rock. with increasing applied\\npressure, the thermal conductivity starts to increase and subsequently\\nthe increase rate tends to be a constant value due to gradual closure\\nof cracks and pores within the rock (görgülü et al., 2008; walsh and\\ndecker, 1966).\\n\\nwhile the above-mentioned studies provide meaningful insight into\\nthe thermal conductivity of various rocks, the thermal conductivity\\ncharacteristics of low-porosity crystalline rocks subjected to different\\nexternal factors such as water saturation, temperature and compression\\nstress have not been fully understood. on the other hand, the information on the thermal conductivity of rocks in a potential hlw repository\\nsite must be known with sufﬁcient conﬁdence to provide necessary\\ninput conditions for its long-term safety assessment, which is one of\\nthe motivations for this study. in this work, experimental investigations\\non the thermal conductivity of the beishan granitic rocks are conducted\\nusing the transient plane source (tps) method. in the following\\ndiscussion, rock sampling and basic physical properties of the rock\\nspecimens are introduced ﬁrst. testing facilities and procedures are\\nthen described. subsequently, the water saturation, temperature and\\ncompression stress dependent thermal conductivity characteristics of\\nthe tested rocks are evaluated comprehensively, and ﬁnally some\\ninsights are obtained.\\n\\n2. rock sampling and preparation\\n\\nthe beishan area is situated in gansu province of northwestern\\nchina (see fig. 1). after a long geological evolution and weathering\\nprocess, the topography of this area is characterized by a ﬂat gobi and\\nsmall gentle rolling hills with elevations ranging between 1400 and\\n2000 m above the sea level. the crust in this area possesses a blocky\\nstructure with many granite intrusions (see fig. 2). other surrounding\\nrocks include mainly metamorphic and sedimentary rocks, as well as\\nquaternary cover. rock sampling was carried out in the jijicao and\\nxinchang rock blocks, which are currently considered as two of the\\nkey investigation sub-areas during site selection and characterization.\\n\\nfig. 1. geographical location of the beishan area and a photo showing its typical topography.\\n\\n\\x0c126\\n\\nx.g. zhao et al. / tectonophysics 683 (2016)

approximately 63 mm were taken\\nfrom six sub-vertical boreholes (i.e., boreholes bs05, bs06, bs15, bs16,\\nbs18 and bs19) in these two sub-areas. the borehole locations are\\npresented in fig. 2.\\n\\nfield observations indicated that the collected granitic rocks\\nwere relatively isotropic in texture and mineralogical composition. to\\nevaluate the geological nature of the rocks, a series of thin sections\\nwere prepared and then exposed to cross-polarized light under an\\noptical microscope to identify the dominant minerals in the rocks. the\\npercentages of the dominant minerals were determined by point\\ncounting on thin sections. for each thin section approximately 500\\npoints covering phenocrysts and groundmass were counted. according\\nto the quartz-alkali feldspar-plagioclase (qap) diagram (streckeisen,\\n1976), the rocks can further be classiﬁed. it can be observed from\\nfig. 3 that the rocks contain mainly a moderate to low amount of quartz\\nand alkali feldspar, and a moderate to high amount of plagioclase. this\\nmeans that the collected rocks dominantly range from granodiorite to\\nmonzogranite. for grain size characteristics, the rocks are from ﬁne\\ngrained to, medium to coarse grained. an overview of the basic information of the rocks is listed in table 1. based on the borehole no. and\\nsampling depth, these rocks have been divided into eight groups.\\n\\na total of 47 pairs of rock specimens, 50 mm in diameter, were\\nprepared from the drill cores with a length to diameter ratio of approximately 0.5. in particular, specimen

the ﬁelds of geology and geophysics, laboratory approaches to\\nmeasuring soil and rock thermal conductivity can mainly be divided\\ninto two groups: steady state and transient state. in this work, the\\ntransient plane source (tps) method (gustafsson, 1991; log and\\ngustafsson, 1995) was utilized to measure the thermal conductivity of\\nthe specimens. as one of the transient measurement methods, the tps\\ntechnique is based on the use of a transiently heated plane sensor\\n(i.e., hot disk sensor) and a hot disk thermal constants analyser (see\\nfig. 4a). the used hot disk tps2500s system can measure thermal\\nconductivity of materials ranging from 0.01 to 400 w/mk. the hot\\ndisk sensor consists of a continuous double spiral, which is etched out\\nof a thin nickel foil (fig. 4e). this spiral is sandwiched between two\\nsheets of electrical insulation materials made of kapton. the sensor\\nacts both as a heat source for increasing the temperature of the specimens and as a dynamic temperature sensor for recording the temperature increase. during the measurement, the temperature in the sensor\\nrises and heat starts to ﬂow to the specimens. the temperature rise in\\nthe sensor provides an indicator of the thermal properties of the specimens. if the specimens have good thermal conducting properties, the\\nheat will be transported rapidly inside the specimens. on the contrary,\\nif the specimens have good thermal insulation properties, the sensor\\ntemperature will rise faster and the heat will not be transported\\nas much as in the test of the good thermal conducting specimens.\\ncompared with steady state measurement methods such as the divided\\nbar (beck and beck, 1958; birch, 1950; sass et al., 1971) and the guarded\\nhot plate (abdulagatova et al., 2009; alishaev et al., 2012), one of significant advantages of the tps technique is that the thermal conductivity of\\nmaterials can be measured more quickly, typically from several to tens\\nof seconds. hence, a long wait for thermal gradients to equilibrate is\\nnot required and the moisture migration in response to temperature\\ngradients was minimized (jackson and taylor, 1986). on the other\\nhand, unlike some transient methods such as thermal needle probes\\n(barry-macaulay et al., 2013; von herzen and maxwell, 1959), which\\nare commonly used for soils and soft rocks, the tps

tps method behaves, the\\nthermal conductivity equation can be solved assuming that the hot\\ndisk sensor consists of a certain number of concentric ring heat\\nsources located in an inﬁnitely large sample (hot disk, 2007). a constant electric power supplied to the sensor results in an increase in\\ntemperature which is directly related to the variation in the sensor\\nresistance (r(t)) by the equation:\\n\\n\\x10\\n\\n\\x11\\nr tð þ ¼ r0 1 þ αδt τð þ\\n\\nð1þ\\n\\nwhere r0 is the nickel electrical resistance in the beginning of the\\nrecording, α is the temperature coefﬁcient of resistance of the nickel\\nfoil, and δtðτþ is the mean value of temperature rise in the sensor due\\nto a constant current pulse given by:\\n\\n\\x10\\n\\nδt τð þ ¼ p0 π3=2ak\\n\\n\\x11−1d τð þ\\n\\nð2þ\\n\\nwhere p0 is the total output of power from the sensor, a is the sensor\\nradius, k is the thermal conductivity of the sample that is being\\ntested and d(τ) is a dimensionless time dependent function with:\\nτ ¼ t=θð\\nð3þ\\n\\nþ1=2; θ ¼ a2=d\\n\\nwhere t is the time measured from the start of the transient\\nrecording, θ is the characteristic time, which depends both on\\nparameters of the sensor and the sample, and d is the thermal\\ndiffusivity of the sample.\\n\\naccording to eq. (2), and δtðτþ and d(τ) plotted as a function of τ\\nprovides a linear relationship with a slope that is a function of p0, a,\\nand k. thermal conductivity k can be obtained by ﬁtting the experimental data to the straight line given by eq. (2); thermal diffusivity d is calculated from eq. (3) taking into account the τ value determined in the\\nprevious ﬁt.\\n\\nas mentioned above, the solution of the thermal conductivity\\nequation is based on the assumption that the hot disk sensor is located\\nin an inﬁnite material in perfect contact with the sensor surface.\\nthis means that the heat ﬂow generated from each measurement\\nmust not reach the outside boundaries of the specimen (hot disk,\\n2007). meanwhile, a careful preparation of specimen ends is required\\nto minimize thermal contact resistance. an estimation of how far the\\nheat ﬂow has proceeded in the specimen during a recording is the\\nprobing depth δp, which is deﬁned as (hot disk, 2007):\\n\\nﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ\\np\\ndt\\n\\nδp ¼ 2\\n\\nð4þ\\n\\nto determine the thermal conductivity with good accuracy, the\\nshortest distance from any part of the sensor to the nearest outside\\nboundary of the sample should be larger than δp. in our experiments,\\nthe used hot disk sensor has a radius of 6.403 mm. the shortest distance\\nis about 19 mm, and the probing depth is approximately 10 mm. for this\\nprobing depth value, we can consider that we are conducting a bulk\\nmeasurement.\\n\\n3.3. test

approximately constant under vacuum within\\n72 h (see fig. 5), indicating that the specimens were saturated with\\nwater. subsequently, the hot disk sensor was horizontally placed between the two saturated specimen pieces with the double spiral\\ncentered and totally covered, and the two specimen pieces were ﬁrmly\\nclamped together to ensure that there was no air gap between the\\nsensor and the specimen end surfaces, as presented in fig. 4d. in order\\nto remain water saturation, the saturated specimens and the sensor\\nwere kept in a plastic bag during thermal conductivity measurement\\n(adl-zarrabi, 2004). after the test, the used water-saturated specimens\\nwere suffered from dehydration treatment in a thermostatic drying\\noven at 105 °c for a period of 24 h and subsequently cooled in a\\ndesiccator to measure the thermal conductivity under a dry condition.\\nmeanwhile, the mass of the dry specimens (mdry) was measured, and\\nthe porosity (n) of the specimens

temperature\\n\\nto investigate the effect of temperature on the thermal conductivity\\nof the tested rocks, measurements were performed on dry specimens\\nfrom 40 °c to 150 °c based on the requirements of the used test\\nequipment. compared with measurements at room temperature, the\\nexperiments under high temperature are time consuming due to a\\nslow stepwise heating process by using a constant temperature oil\\nbath and a temperature control system, as shown in fig. 4c. the thermal\\nconductivity measurement can only be conducted until the two specimen pieces in the chamber with a specimen holder within the oil bath\\nhave reached thermal equilibrium and kept a target temperature\\nvalue. during thermal equilibrium of the oil bath, the hot disk sensor\\nmonitors continuously the temperature variation of the specimens.\\nfor our tests, the thermal conductivity of the specimens was measured\\nwhen the recorded temperature variation of the specimens is less than\\n0.04 °c.

maintained constant for a period of about 15 min to avoid residual temperature drifts on the specimens. based on the in-situ stress\\nmeasurement results obtained from the beishan area (zhao et al.,\\n2013), the maximum axial compression stress applied to the\\nspecimens was set to be 45 mpa to approximately simulate the\\nexcavation-induced stress near the vertical hlw disposal element\\nboundary at a depth of 600 m. the axial stress applied to the specimens was recorded automatically, and the used stress path throughout the course of testing is presented in fig. 7. the experiments were\\nconducted at room temperature.\\n\\naccording to previous experimental results (zhao et al., 2015a; zhao\\net al., 2015b), the identiﬁed crack initiation stresses of cylindrical specimens of beishan granitic rocks under uniaxial compression using the\\ncumulative ae hit (caeh) method range from 45.3 to 109.1 mpa,\\nwhich are larger than the maximum compression stress adopted in\\nthe present study. hence, the stress-induced rock damage might not\\noccur in the tested specimens during loading. it should be mentioned\\nthat in the process of loading, the friction may occur at the interfaces\\nbetween the specimen ends and the sensor. due to limitation of the\\ntps measurement technique, the utilized test method does not consider\\nthe potential inﬂuence of interface friction effect on the experimental\\nresults. to reduce or eliminate the friction effect, further efforts are\\nneeded to produce innovative design for the test equipment. although\\nnot perfect, the

the interfaces between the specimens and the steel\\nplatens were daubed with a thin layer of lubricant to reduce the\\nend effect of the platens during loading. when the experimental\\nsetup was

were added to this ﬁgure.\\nit is seen that the thermal conductivity of the specimens shows a\\ndecaying trend with increasing temperature, and the values at 150 °c\\nrange from 5.7% to 8.7% lower than those at room temperature. this\\nmeans that within the used temperature range, the inﬂuence of the\\nincreasing temperature on the decay of thermal conductivity for these\\nrocks is limited. on the other hand, a possible reason for the gradual\\ndecrease in thermal conductivity is the generation of thermally induced\\nmicrocracks in the rocks because of a mismatch between thermal\\nexpansion coefﬁcients of adjacent mineral grains in a homogeneous\\ntemperature ﬁeld (jansen et al., 1993), which has been demonstrated from a microcracking perspective based on numerical simulations\\n(zhao, 2016). based on the experimental data, the relationship\\nbetween thermal conductivity and temperature can be described\\nusing the equation:\\nk ¼ kr − at2\\n\\nð8þ\\n\\nwhere kr is the thermal conductivity of the rock at room temperature\\n(25 °c), t is the temperature in celsius, and a is the ﬁt coefﬁcient (see\\ntable 3). the parameter a affects the decaying velocity of the

(2013), the abovementioned mixing models were used to predict the thermal conductivity values of the tested rocks in the water-saturated state. fig. 9 shows\\nthe comparison between measured and calculated thermal conductivities for the four different models. it can be observed from fig. 9a, b, and d\\nthat the geometric mean, the arithmetic mean, and the effectivemedium mean yield similar prediction results and consistently underestimate the thermal conductivity of the eight rock groups, especially for\\nthe groups with relatively high porosity values (e.g., groups bs05 and\\nbs15). the hashin–shtrikman mean shows a reasonably good ﬁt for\\nall rock groups, as shown in fig. 9c. the analysis results are basically in\\nline with observations reported by fuchs et al. (2013) because most of\\nthe evaluated mixing models used in their analysis also underestimate\\nthe thermal conductivity of the rocks. however, the geometric mean\\nmodel was rated as the best ﬁt to their data set. it should be noted\\nthat the rocks used in their analysis covered different rock types with\\na large range in porosity, from almost zero to about 30%. in addition,\\nthe measured thermal conductivity values of these rocks spans the interval between 1.0 and 6.5 w/mk. the present investigations focused\\nmainly on the granitic rocks with low porosities and a narrow thermal\\nconductivity range. hence, the large difference of rock properties may\\nresult in uncertainties between analysis results obtained from various\\nmixing models. more work is required to explain this discrepancy.\\n\\nnagaraju and roy (2014) deﬁned the effect of water saturation on\\nthermal conductivity (s) as a function of porosity of rocks, and s is\\nexpressed by\\ns ¼ ksat − kdry\\n\\nð7þ\\n\\nkdry\\n\\naccording to the measurement results listed in table 2, we\\nestablished the relationship between s and the porosity of the rocks,\\nas presented in fig. 10. analysis of fig. 10 reveals that the effect of\\nwater saturation on thermal conductivity of rocks presents an\\nincreasing trend with an increase of porosity. a linear form expression\\ncan ﬁt the data reasonably well while ensuring that the line passes\\nthrough the origin.\\n\\n4.2. inﬂuence of temperature on the thermal conductivity\\n\\nfig. 11 presents the variation of thermal conductivity of seven pairs\\nof dry specimens in different rock groups with temperature from 40 °c\\n\\ntable 3\\nfit coefﬁcient a for thermal conductivity-temperature curves of seven pairs of specimens\\nin different rock groups.\\n\\nrock type and specimen no.\\n\\nmonzogranite (bs05-07)\\ngranodiorite (bs06-05)\\nmonzogranite (bs15-07)\\ngranodiorite (bs16-05)\\nmonzogranite (bs18-1-08)\\ngranodiorite (bs18-2-05)\\nmonzogranite (bs19-1-07)\\n\\na (10−6)\\n\\n8.821\\n5.679\\n8.394\\n4.871\\n6.891\\n5.728\\n6.385\\n\\nr2\\n\\n0.9830\\n0.9334\\n0.9853\\n0.9289\\n0.9262\\n0.9581\\n0.9933\\n\\n132\\n\\nx.g. zhao et al. / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137\\n\\n\\x0cx.g. zhao et al. / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137\\n\\n133\\n\\nn=2\\n\\n20\\n\\n10\\naxial stress (mpa)\\n\\n30\\n\\n40\\n\\nn=3\\n\\n20\\n\\n10\\naxial stress (mpa)\\n\\n30\\n\\n40\\n\\n50\\n\\n50\\n\\n3.4\\n\\n3.3\\n\\n3.2\\n\\n3.1\\n\\n3.0\\n\\n2.9\\n\\n2.8\\n\\n2.7\\n\\n2.6\\n\\n2.5\\n\\n2.4\\n\\nc\\n\\nthermal conductivity (w/mk)\\n\\n50\\n\\n0\\n\\nf\\n\\n2.9\\n\\n2.8\\n\\n2.7\\n\\n2.6\\n\\n2.5\\n\\n2.4\\n\\nthermal conductivity (w/mk)\\n\\n50\\n\\n0\\n\\nn=3\\n\\n20\\n\\n10\\naxial stress (mpa)\\n\\n30\\n\\n40\\n\\nn=3\\n\\n20\\n\\n10\\naxial stress (mpa)\\n\\n30\\n\\n40\\n\\nbs05\\nbs06\\nbs15\\nbs16\\nbs18-1\\nbs18-2\\nbs19-1\\nbs19-2\\n\\ny=24.15-24.99e-x\\n(r2=0.9296)\\n\\n21\\n\\n18\\n\\n15\\n\\n12\\n\\n0369\\n\\ni\\n\\nr(%) \\n\\nn=1\\n\\n20\\n\\n10\\naxial stress (mpa)\\n\\n30\\n\\n40\\n\\n50\\n\\n0.0\\n\\n0.3\\n\\n0.9\\n\\n1.2\\n0.6\\nporosity (%)\\n\\n1.5\\n\\n1.8\\n\\nb\\n\\n3.0\\n\\n2.9\\n\\n2.8\\n\\n2.7\\n\\n2.6\\n\\n2.5\\n\\n2.4\\n\\nthermal conductivity (w/mk)\\n\\n50\\n\\n0\\n\\n3.2e\\n3.1\\n\\n3.0\\n\\n2.9\\n\\n2.8\\n\\n2.7\\n\\n2.6\\n\\n2.5\\n\\n2.4\\n\\nthermal conductivity (w/mk)\\n\\n50\\n\\n0\\n\\n3.2h\\n\\n3.1\\n\\n3.0\\n\\n2.9\\n\\n2.8\\n\\n2.7\\n\\n2.6\\n\\nthermal conductivity (w/mk)\\n\\n50\\n\\n0\\n\\nn=3\\n\\n20\\n\\n10\\naxial stress (mpa)\\n\\n30\\n\\n40\\n\\nn=3\\n\\n20\\n\\n10\\naxial stress (mpa)\\n\\n30\\n\\n40\\n\\nn=2\\n\\n20\\n\\n10\\naxial stress (mpa)\\n\\n30\\n\\n40\\n\\n3.0\\n\\n2.9\\n\\n2.8\\n\\n2.7\\n\\n2.6\\n\\n2.5\\n\\n2.4\\n\\n2.3\\n\\n2.2\\n\\na\\n\\nthermal conductivity (w/mk)\\n\\n3.0d\\n2.9\\n\\n2.8\\n\\n2.7\\n\\n2.6\\n\\n2.5\\n\\n2.4\\n\\n2.3\\n\\n2.2\\n\\n2.1\\n\\n2.0\\n\\nthermal conductivity (w/mk)\\n\\n3.0g\\n\\n2.9\\n\\n2.8\\n\\n2.7\\n\\n2.6\\n\\n2.5\\n\\n2.4\\n\\nthermal conductivity (w/mk)\\n\\n0\\n\\n0\\n\\n0\\n\\nfig. 14. inﬂuence of axial compression stress on the thermal conductivity of the eight rock groups: (a) bs05, (b) bs06, (c) bs15, (d) bs16, (e) bs18-1, (f) bs18-2, (g) bs19-1 and (h) bs19-2,\\nand variation of the increase rate of the thermal conductivity (r) with rock porosity (i). error bars indicate the standard deviation of the thermal conductivity. n in the ﬁgures represents\\nthe number of specimen pairs in each rock group.\\n\\nwe attempted to relate a with other rock parameters and found that\\na depended on the magnitude of rock porosity (n), as presented in\\nfig. 12. the coefﬁcient a varies with porosity n according to the following equation:\\na ¼ 9:43 − 0:71=n2\\n\\nð9þ\\n\\naccording to eqs.

(11) reveals that the coefﬁcient b plays a critical role in controlling\\nthe increasing gradient of the thermal conductivity in the initial loading\\nstage (i.e., crack closure stage). the coefﬁcient c dominantly affects the\\nincreasing velocity of the thermal conductivity in the subsequent elastic\\ndeformation stage. based on experimental investigations on the thermal conductivity of some rocks subjected to uniaxial stresses using a\\nsteady-state apparatus developed by demırcı et al. (2004), görgülü\\net al. (2008) found that the parameters b and c depended on the magnitude of elastic modulus of the rocks, and subsequently established an\\nelastic modulus dependent model to predict the thermal conductivity\\nvalues under pressure. unfortunately, in the present study, the elastic\\nmoduli of the tested rocks have not been available. therefore, the\\nmodel proposed by görgülü et al. (2008) cannot be used to ﬁt our test\\nresults. according to fig. 14, we found that the increasing gradients of\\nthe thermal conductivities in the initial loading stage were generally\\nlarge for the

predictions and underestimated the thermal conductivity of the rocks under the water-saturated condition. future work\\nis demanded to verify the validity of various mixing models using different rock types with a large porosity range.\\n\\nwith increasing temperature from 25 °c to 150 °c, the thermal conductivity of the rocks shows a decaying trend and the values at 150 °c\\nrange from 5.7% to 8.7% lower than those at room temperature, revealing that the inﬂuence of temperature on the thermal conductivity of the\\ntested rocks is limited. in addition, the thermal conductivity of the rocks\\nincreases with increasing compression stress in a nonlinear behavior,\\nand the increase rate of the thermal conductivity increases with an increase of rock porosity. it is found that the effects of compression stress\\nand water saturation on the magnitude of thermal conductivity of the\\nrocks are basically comparable. based on the experimental data, the\\nempirical models considering the inﬂuence of rock porosity have been\\nestablished for predicting the temperature and compression stress\\ndependent thermal conductivity characteristics of the rocks, and the\\npredictions are found to be in good agreement with experimental results. this study thus emphasizes importance of porosity on thermal\\nconductivity measurements even for low porosity crystalline rocks.\\n\\nwhen the pores and cracks in the rocks tend to close during compression, quartz content may determine the thermal conductivity, and\\nthere exists an increase of the thermal conductivity with increasing\\nquartz content. this is because the closure of pores and cracks increases\\nthe contact opportunity of quartz grains, and hence improves the transportation capability of heat ﬂow in the rocks. while the test results provide insights into the thermal conductivity characteristics of beishan\\ngranitic rocks, one should be aware of the limitation of this study.\\nbecause the thermal conductivity of granitic rocks is inﬂuenced by\\nmany factors. in order to better understand the thermal conductivity\\nof granitic rocks related to rock characteristics such as rock fabric,\\ngrain shape, grain contact and grain size, comprehensive petrographic\\ninvestigations are recommended in the future. in the meantime, studies\\nshould be carried out to understand how the interactions between mineral components affect the thermal conductivity. work is also being\\nconducted to investigate the thermal conductivity of the rocks under\\ncoupled thermal-hydro-mechanical

wang, 2014). site selection for china's hlw repository started in 1985 (wang, 2010). the efforts have been focused on potential hlw repository sites located within granite intrusions in mainland china. since 1999, the beijing research  ⁎ corresponding author.  e-mail address: xingguang100@126.com (x.g. zhao).  http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tecto.2016.06.021 0040-1951/© 2016 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.  institute of uranium geology (briug) has performed site characterization studies in the beishan area, china. so far, the beishan area has been considered as the most potential candidate area for china's hlw repository.  among all the engineering properties of crystalline rocks at a potential hlw repository site, the thermal conductivity is one of the most important parameters in design consideration because it has a direct impact on the evaluation of the necessary repository volume and the optimization of the repository layout (sundberg and hellström, 2009). for instance, in the swedish kbs-3 concept for geological disposal of spent fuel, copper canisters with cast iron inserts containing the spent fuel are surrounded by bentonite for isolation and mechanical protection (brantberger et al., 2006). the heat generated by the spent fuel will increase the temperature of all components of the repository. for the bentonite buffer outside the canisters, the peak temperature must not exceed 100 °c. this requirement implies that the canisters cannot be deposited arbitrarily close to each other. on the other hand, unnecessarily large distances between the canisters will mean inefﬁcient and costly use of the repository rock volume (hökmark et al., 2009). to fulﬁll the temperature requirement, the rocks with low thermal conductivities will  \\x0cx.g. zhao et al. / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137  125  lead to a larger distance between canisters than for a case with high thermal conductivities. this is because the rocks with low thermal conductivities will give rise to higher temperatures in the bentonite (sundberg et al., 2008). hence, to design and construct repositories successfully, it is essential to perform an accurate assessment of the thermal conductivity characteristics of the host rock. over the past few decades, various experimental approaches have been employed to measure the thermal conductivity of rocks. the results indicate that the thermal conductivity of rocks is closely associated with mineral composition, porosity, texture, and density, etc. (birch and clark, 1940; clauser and huenges, 1995; hartmann et al., 2005; özkahraman et al., 2004; pasquale et al., 2015; ray et al., 2007; sundberg et al., 2009). for crystalline rocks with relatively homogeneous texture and low porosity, the mineral composition dominates the thermal conductivity. in volcanic and sedimentary rocks, the high variability of porosity in these rocks is a major factor controlling the thermal conductivity (clauser and huenges, 1995; özkahraman et al., 2004). for example, increasing porosity, which acts as barrier to the ﬂow of heat, often results in both lower p-wave velocity and lower thermal conductivity values (özkahraman et al., 2004). for a given rock, water content and temperature have an inﬂuence on its thermal conductivity. generally, the thermal conductivity of the rock increases and decreases with increasing water content (cho and kwon, 2010; cho et al., 2009) and temperature (abdulagatova et al., 2009; birch and clark, 1940; heuze, 1983; miao et al., 2014; mottaghy et al., 2008; vosteen and schellschmidt, 2003), respectively. moreover, the effect of water saturation on the thermal conductivity of rocks shows a generally increasing trend with increasing porosity (nagaraju and roy, 2014). given that the thermal conductivity of surrounding rocks around the excavations will be changed by the excavation-induced stress, some researchers studied the inﬂuence of pressure on the thermal conductivity of rocks (abdulagatova et al., 2010; abdulagatova et al., 2009; demırcı et al., 2004; görgülü et al., 2008; sibbitt, 1976; walsh and decker, 1966; zimmerman, 1989). one of the main ﬁndings achieved from these investigations shows that the thermal conductivity  varies with the pressure exerted on the rock. with increasing applied pressure, the thermal conductivity starts to increase and subsequently the increase rate tends to be a constant value due to gradual closure of cracks and pores within the rock (görgülü et al., 2008; walsh and decker, 1966).  while the above-mentioned studies provide meaningful insight into the thermal conductivity of various rocks, the thermal conductivity characteristics of low-porosity crystalline rocks subjected to different external factors such as water saturation, temperature and compression stress have not been fully understood. on the other hand, the information on the thermal conductivity of rocks in a potential hlw repository site must be known with sufﬁcient conﬁdence to provide necessary input conditions for its long-term safety assessment, which is one of the motivations for this study. in this work, experimental investigations on the thermal conductivity of the beishan granitic rocks are conducted using the transient plane source (tps) method. in the following discussion, rock sampling and basic physical properties of the rock specimens are introduced ﬁrst. testing facilities and procedures are then described. subsequently, the water saturation, temperature and compression stress dependent thermal conductivity characteristics of the tested rocks are evaluated comprehensively, and ﬁnally some insights are obtained.  2. rock sampling and preparation  the beishan area is situated in gansu province of northwestern china (see fig. 1). after a long geological evolution and weathering process, the topography of this area is characterized by a ﬂat gobi and small gentle rolling hills with elevations ranging between 1400 and 2000 m above the sea level. the crust in this area possesses a blocky structure with many granite intrusions (see fig. 2). other surrounding rocks include mainly metamorphic and sedimentary rocks, as well as quaternary cover. rock sampling was carried out in the jijicao and xinchang rock blocks, which are currently considered as two of the key investigation sub-areas during site selection and characterization.  fig. 1. geographical location of the beishan area and a photo showing its typical topography.  \\x0c126  x.g. zhao et al. / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137  xinchang  bs06  bs18  bs19  jijicao  bs16  bs15  bs05  n  2.5 km  granitic rock  sedimentary rock  metamorphic rock  quaternary cover  borehole  fault  fig. 2. rock sampling from six boreholes in the jijicao and xinchang sub-areas for thermal conductivity measurements.  intact drill cores with a diameter of approximately 63 mm were taken from six sub-vertical boreholes (i.e., boreholes bs05, bs06, bs15, bs16, bs18 and bs19) in these two sub-areas. the borehole locations are presented in fig. 2.  field observations indicated that the collected granitic rocks were relatively isotropic in texture and mineralogical composition. to evaluate the geological nature of the rocks, a series of thin sections were prepared and then exposed to cross-polarized light under an optical microscope to identify the dominant minerals in the rocks. the percentages of the dominant minerals were determined by point counting on thin sections. for each thin section approximately 500 points covering phenocrysts and groundmass were counted. according to the quartz-alkali feldspar-plagioclase (qap) diagram (streckeisen, 1976), the rocks can further be classiﬁed. it can be observed from fig. 3 that the rocks contain mainly a moderate to low amount of quartz and alkali feldspar, and a moderate to high amount of plagioclase. this means that the collected rocks dominantly range from granodiorite to monzogranite. for grain size characteristics, the rocks are from ﬁne grained to, medium to coarse grained. an overview of the basic information of the rocks is listed in table 1. based on the borehole no. and sampling depth, these rocks have been divided into eight groups.  a total of 47 pairs of rock specimens, 50 mm in diameter, were prepared from the drill cores with a length to diameter ratio of approximately 0.5. in particular, specimen ends were polished carefully using a  q  90          90  i - granodiorite ii - monzogranite  60                                   60          ii         i    bs05 bs06 bs15 bs16 bs18-1 bs18-2 bs19-1 bs19-2  20                                                                     20  5                                                                                  5 p  10                 35                       65                  90  a  fig. 3. qap classiﬁcation of the eight rock groups based on modal analysis.  grinding machine until the ﬂatness and roughness of the ends are less than 10 μm and 3 μm, respectively. the ﬂat and polished specimen end surfaces minimize the thermal contact resistance during thermal conductivity measurement. a minimum of ten specimens for each rock group were prepared.  3. test methodology  3.1. an introduction to the used tps method  in the ﬁelds of geology and geophysics, laboratory approaches to measuring soil and rock thermal conductivity can mainly be divided into two groups: steady state and transient state. in this work, the transient plane source (tps) method (gustafsson, 1991; log and gustafsson, 1995) was utilized to measure the thermal conductivity of the specimens. as one of the transient measurement methods, the tps technique is based on the use of a transiently heated plane sensor (i.e., hot disk sensor) and a hot disk thermal constants analyser (see fig. 4a). the used hot disk tps2500s system can measure thermal conductivity of materials ranging from 0.01 to 400 w/mk. the hot disk sensor consists of a continuous double spiral, which is etched out of a thin nickel foil (fig. 4e). this spiral is sandwiched between two sheets of electrical insulation materials made of kapton. the sensor acts both as a heat source for increasing the temperature of the specimens and as a dynamic temperature sensor for recording the temperature increase. during the measurement, the temperature in the sensor rises and heat starts to ﬂow to the specimens. the temperature rise in the sensor provides an indicator of the thermal properties of the specimens. if the specimens have good thermal conducting properties, the heat will be transported rapidly inside the specimens. on the contrary, if the specimens have good thermal insulation properties, the sensor temperature will rise faster and the heat will not be transported as much as in the test of the good thermal conducting specimens. compared with steady state measurement methods such as the divided bar (beck and beck, 1958; birch, 1950; sass et al., 1971) and the guarded hot plate (abdulagatova et al., 2009; alishaev et al., 2012), one of significant advantages of the tps technique is that the thermal conductivity of materials can be measured more quickly, typically from several to tens of seconds. hence, a long wait for thermal gradients to equilibrate is not required and the moisture migration in response to temperature gradients was minimized (jackson and taylor, 1986). on the other hand, unlike some transient methods such as thermal needle probes (barry-macaulay et al., 2013; von herzen and maxwell, 1959), which are commonly used for soils and soft rocks, the tps method can be  \\x0cx.g. zhao et al. / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137  127  table 1 basic information and geological description of the tested rocks.  rock type and group  basic information  mineral composition  naked eye observation  photomicrograph of a thin section  monzogranite (bs05)  location: jijicao borehole no.: bs05 sampling depth: 5–7 m number of specimen pairs: 7 grain size: medium  plagioclase: 33.7% ± 5.8%;

popov et al., 2003). hence, the thermal resistance between the specimen ends and the sensor exists (see section 3.2). so far, the tps technology has been widely used to  \\x0c128  x.g. zhao et al. / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137  a   c   temperature control system  b   hot disk thermal   constants analyser   sensor   platen   specimens  d   e   specimens  insulation material  chamber   sensor   specimens   oil bath   sensor   double spiral  cable extension  fig. 4. the hot disk tps2500s system (a) used to measure the thermal conductivity of specimens under room temperature (d), high temperature (c), and uniaxial compression (b) conditions. a hot disk sensor showing its key components (e).  determine the thermal properties of different materials (lagüela et al., 2015;

θ ¼ a2=d  where t is the time measured from the start of the transient recording, θ is the characteristic time, which depends both on parameters of the sensor and the sample, and d is the thermal diffusivity of the sample.  according to eq. (2), and δtðτþ and d(τ) plotted as a function of τ provides a linear relationship with a slope that is a function of p0, a, and k. thermal conductivity k can be obtained by ﬁtting the experimental data to the straight line given by eq. (2); thermal diffusivity d is calculated from eq. (3) taking into account the τ value determined in the previous ﬁt.  as mentioned above, the solution of the thermal conductivity equation is based on the assumption that the hot disk sensor is located in an inﬁnite material in perfect contact with the sensor surface. this means that the heat ﬂow generated from each measurement must not reach the outside boundaries of the specimen (hot disk, 2007). meanwhile, a careful preparation of specimen ends is required to minimize thermal contact resistance. an estimation of how far the heat ﬂow has proceeded in the specimen during a recording is the probing depth δp, which is deﬁned as (hot disk, 2007):  ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ p dt  δp ¼ 2  ð4þ  to determine the thermal conductivity with good accuracy, the shortest distance from any part of the sensor to the nearest outside boundary of the sample should be larger than δp. in our experiments, the used hot disk sensor has a radius of 6.403 mm. the shortest distance is about 19 mm, and the probing depth is approximately 10 mm. for this probing depth value, we can consider that we are conducting a bulk measurement.  3.3. test procedures  3.3.1. tests on specimens under saturated and dry conditions  firstly, the specimens were immersed by deionized water in a vacuum for a period of 96 h. the specimens were then taken from the vacuum and the water droplets on the surfaces were wiped dry, care

constant under vacuum within 72 h (see fig. 5), indicating that the specimens were saturated with water. subsequently, the hot disk sensor was horizontally placed between the two saturated specimen pieces with the double spiral centered and totally covered, and the two specimen pieces were ﬁrmly clamped together to ensure that there was no air gap between the sensor and the specimen end surfaces, as presented in fig. 4d. in order to remain water saturation, the saturated specimens and the sensor were kept in a plastic bag during thermal conductivity measurement (adl-zarrabi, 2004). after the test, the used water-saturated specimens were suffered from dehydration treatment in a thermostatic drying oven at 105 °c for a period of 24 h and subsequently cooled in a desiccator to measure the thermal conductivity under a dry condition. meanwhile, the mass of the dry specimens (mdry) was measured, and the porosity (n) of the specimens was calculated using the equations  n ¼ 100v p  v %  v p ¼ msat − mdry  ρw  ð5þ  ð6þ  where v is the bulk rock volume, vp is the pore volume, and ρw is the density of water. for each pair of specimens saturated or dried, measurements on the thermal conductivity were carried out at room temperature (25 ± 1 °c).  3.3.2. tests on specimens under increasing temperature  to investigate the effect of temperature on the thermal conductivity of the tested rocks, measurements were performed on dry specimens from 40 °c to 150 °c based on the requirements of the used test equipment. compared with measurements at room temperature, the experiments under high temperature are time consuming due to a slow stepwise heating process by using a constant temperature oil bath and a temperature control system, as shown in fig. 4c. the thermal conductivity measurement can only be conducted until the two specimen pieces in the chamber with a specimen holder within the oil bath have reached thermal equilibrium and kept a target temperature value. during thermal equilibrium of the oil bath, the hot disk sensor monitors continuously the temperature variation of the specimens. for our tests, the thermal conductivity of the specimens was measured when the recorded temperature variation of the specimens is less than 0.04 °c. in general, 32 h were needed to complete one test. a typical temperature-time history during the test is

measurement, the load was maintained constant for a period of about 15 min to avoid residual temperature drifts on the specimens. based on the in-situ stress measurement results obtained from the beishan area (zhao et al., 2013), the maximum axial compression stress applied to the specimens was set to be 45 mpa to approximately simulate the excavation-induced stress near the vertical hlw disposal element boundary at a depth of 600 m. the axial stress applied to the specimens was recorded automatically, and the used stress path throughout the course of testing is presented in fig. 7. the experiments were conducted at room temperature.  according to previous experimental results (zhao et al., 2015a; zhao et al., 2015b), the identiﬁed crack initiation stresses of cylindrical specimens of beishan granitic rocks under uniaxial compression using the cumulative ae hit (caeh) method range from 45.3 to 109.1 mpa, which are larger than the maximum compression stress adopted in the present study. hence, the stress-induced rock damage might not occur in the tested specimens during loading. it should be mentioned that in the process of loading, the friction may occur at the interfaces between the specimen ends and the sensor. due to limitation of the tps measurement technique, the utilized test method does not consider the potential inﬂuence of interface friction effect on the experimental results. to reduce or eliminate the friction effect, further efforts are needed to produce innovative design for the test equipment. although not perfect, the developed test system provides a feasible means for us to gain insight into thermal conductivity behaviors of rocks under compression.  4. test results  4.1. inﬂuence of water saturation on the thermal conductivity  table

content of the specimens, leading to difﬁculties in evaluating the relationship between the thermal conductivity and the water saturation degree of the specimens quantitatively.  3.3.3. tests on specimens under uniaxial compression  the uniaxial compression tests on dry specimens were conducted using a hydraulic servo-controlled compression machine. for each test, two specimen pieces with the hot disk sensor were contained between steel platens machined to match their end surfaces, as shown in fig. 4b. the interfaces between the specimens and the steel platens were daubed with a thin layer of lubricant to reduce the end effect of the platens during loading. when the experimental setup was completed, axial-load control was used with a loading rate of 100 n/s and the axial load was increased with an increment  thermal conductivity measurements were carried out on the 40 pairs of specimens both in dry and water-saturated conditions, and the results are listed in table 2. a statistical analysis shows that for the eight rock groups under dry or saturated state, the standard deviation (sd) and coefﬁcient of variation (cov) of the thermal conductivity are all less than 0.06 w/mk and 4%, respectively, indicating that the results between specimens in each rock group have a good consistency. for all rock groups, the average thermal conductivity values in the dry state

the dry specimens were saturated with water, water with a higher thermal conductivity (0.604 w/mk) replaced the air with a lower thermal conductivity (0.025 w/mk) in the void of the rocks, leading to

 to 150 °c. the thermal conductivity of these specimens at room temperature (25 °c) was also measured and the data were added to this ﬁgure. it is seen that the thermal conductivity of the specimens shows a decaying trend with increasing temperature, and the values at 150 °c range from 5.7% to 8.7% lower than those at room temperature. this means that within the used temperature range, the inﬂuence of the increasing temperature on the decay of thermal conductivity for these rocks is limited. on the other hand, a possible reason for the gradual decrease in thermal conductivity is the generation of thermally induced microcracks in the rocks because of a mismatch between thermal expansion coefﬁcients of adjacent mineral grains in a homogeneous temperature ﬁeld (jansen et al., 1993), which has been demonstrated from a microcracking perspective based on numerical simulations (zhao, 2016). based on the experimental data, the relationship between thermal conductivity and temperature can be described using the equation: k ¼ kr − at2  ð8þ  where kr is the thermal conductivity of the rock at room temperature (25 °c), t is the temperature in celsius, and a is the ﬁt coefﬁcient (see table 3). the parameter a affects the decaying velocity of the thermal conductivity with the temperature, i.e., the decaying velocity of the thermal conductivity increases as a increases. as shown in table 3, a in eq. (8) varies from rock to rock and can be determined only using laboratory tests. in order to develop a model for predicting a,   individual fit  overall fit (model)  bs15-07  bs18-1-08  bs06-05 bs18-2-05 bs19-1-05 bs05-07  bs16-05  2.9  2.8  2.7  2.6  2.5  2.4  2.3  2.2  thermal conductivity (w/mk)  0  20  40  80  60 100 temperature (oc)  120  140  160  fig. 13. comparison of overall ﬁt using the temperature and rock porosity dependent thermal conductivity model and individual ﬁt of seven pairs of specimens in different rock groups.  behavior. however, with further increase of rock porosity, the approximately linear relationship between kdry and ksat is not valid anymore. for example, the rock groups bs05 and bs15 with average porosity values greater than or equal to 0.68% exhibit higher thermal conductivity in the water-saturated state relative to the dry state.  to evaluate the thermal conductivity of rocks, various mixing models such as the geometric mean (lichtenecker, 1924), the arithmetic mean (voigt, 1928), the hashin–shtrikman mean (hashin and shtrikman, 1962), and the effective-medium mean (bruggeman, 1935; clauser, 2009) have been proposed. comprehensive overviews and case studies on such mixing models can be found in (abdulagatova et al., 2009; clauser, 2009; fuchs et al., 2013; hartmann, 2005; ray et al., 2015). based on the experimental data (see table 2) in combination with the methodology used by fuchs et al. (2013), the abovementioned mixing models were used to predict the thermal conductivity values of the tested rocks in the water-saturated state. fig. 9 shows the comparison between measured and calculated thermal conductivities for the four different models. it can be observed from fig. 9a, b, and d that the geometric mean, the arithmetic mean, and the effectivemedium mean yield similar prediction results and consistently underestimate the thermal conductivity of the eight rock groups, especially for the groups with relatively high porosity values (e.g., groups bs05 and bs15). the hashin–shtrikman mean shows a reasonably good ﬁt for all rock groups, as shown in fig. 9c. the analysis results are basically in line with observations reported by fuchs et al. (2013) because most of the evaluated mixing models used in their analysis also underestimate the thermal conductivity of the rocks. however, the geometric mean model was rated as the best ﬁt to their data set. it should be noted that the rocks used in their analysis covered different rock types with a large range in porosity, from almost zero to about 30%. in addition, the measured thermal conductivity values of these rocks spans the interval between 1.0 and 6.5 w/mk. the present investigations focused mainly on the granitic rocks with low porosities and a narrow thermal conductivity range. hence, the large difference of rock properties may result in uncertainties between analysis results obtained from various mixing models. more work is required to explain this discrepancy.  nagaraju and roy (2014) deﬁned the effect of water saturation on thermal conductivity (s) as a function of porosity of rocks, and s is expressed by s ¼ ksat − kdry  ð7þ  kdry  according to the measurement results listed in table 2, we established the relationship between s and the porosity of the rocks, as presented in fig. 10. analysis of fig. 10 reveals that the effect of water saturation on thermal conductivity of rocks presents an increasing trend with an increase of porosity. a linear form expression can ﬁt the data reasonably well while ensuring that the line passes through the origin.  4.2. inﬂuence of temperature on the thermal conductivity  fig. 11 presents the variation of thermal conductivity of seven pairs of dry specimens in different rock groups with temperature from 40 °c  table 3 fit coefﬁcient a for thermal conductivity-temperature curves of seven pairs of specimens in different rock groups.  rock type and specimen no.  monzogranite (bs05-07) granodiorite (bs06-05) monzogranite (bs15-07) granodiorite (bs16-05) monzogranite (bs18-1-08) granodiorite (bs18-2-05) monzogranite (bs19-1-07)  a (10−6)  8.821 5.679 8.394 4.871 6.891 5.728 6.385  r2  0.9830 0.9334 0.9853 0.9289 0.9262 0.9581 0.9933  132  x.g. zhao et al. / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137  \\x0cx.g. zhao et al. / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137  133  n=2  20  10 axial stress (mpa)  30  40  n=3  20  10 axial stress (mpa)  30  40  50  50  3.4  3.3  3.2  3.1  3.0  2.9  2.8  2.7  2.6  2.5  2.4  c  thermal conductivity (w/mk)  50  0  f  2.9  2.8  2.7  2.6  2.5  2.4  thermal conductivity (w/mk)  50  0  n=3  20  10 axial stress (mpa)  30  40  n=3  20  10 axial stress (mpa)  30  40  bs05 bs06 bs15 bs16 bs18-1 bs18-2 bs19-1 bs19-2  y=24.15-24.99e-x (r2=0.9296)  21  18  15  12  0369  i  r(%)   n=1  20  10 axial stress (mpa)  30  40  50  0.0  0.3  0.9  1.2 0.6 porosity (%)  1.5  1.8  b  3.0  2.9  2.8  2.7  2.6  2.5  2.4  thermal conductivity (w/mk)  50  0  3.2e 3.1  3.0  2.9  2.8  2.7  2.6  2.5  2.4  thermal conductivity (w/mk)  50  0  3.2h  3.1  3.0  2.9  2.8  2.7  2.6  thermal conductivity (w/mk)  50  0  n=3  20  10 axial stress (mpa)  30  40  n=3  20  10 axial stress (mpa)  30  40  n=2  20  10 axial stress (mpa)  30  40  3.0  2.9  2.8  2.7  2.6  2.5  2.4  2.3  2.2  a  thermal conductivity (w/mk)  3.0d 2.9  2.8  2.7  2.6  2.5  2.4  2.3  2.2  2.1  2.0  thermal conductivity (w/mk)  3.0g  2.9  2.8  2.7  2.6  2.5  2.4  thermal conductivity (w/mk)  0  0  0  fig. 14. inﬂuence of axial compression stress on the thermal conductivity of the eight rock groups: (a) bs05, (b) bs06, (c) bs15, (d) bs16, (e) bs18-1, (f) bs18-2, (g) bs19-1 and (h) bs19-2, and variation of the increase rate of the thermal conductivity (r) with rock porosity (i). error bars indicate the standard deviation of the thermal conductivity. n in the ﬁgures represents the number of specimen pairs in each rock group.  we attempted to relate a with other rock parameters and found that a depended on the magnitude of rock porosity (n), as presented in fig. 12. the coefﬁcient a varies with porosity n according to the following equation: a ¼ 9:43 − 0:71=n2  ð9þ  according to eqs.

(11) is not sensitive to the variation of rock porosity, and is within the range from 0.20 to 0.27 except for the rock group bs19-1. for simplicity, an average value of c = 0.24 obtained from table 4 is used to approximately describe the trend, as shown in fig. 15b. using eqs. (11)–(12) and the constant coefﬁcient c, an overall ﬁt is made for these rock groups to reproduce the rock porosity-dependent thermal conductivity under different axial stresses. a comparison between individual and overall ﬁt results is presented in fig. 16. it is found that for each rock group subjected to different compression stresses, the difference of the thermal conductivity values from the individual and overall ﬁts is less than 0.05 w/mk. the good agreement indicates that the established rock porosity-dependent model can capture the nonlinear stress-thermal conductivity relationships of the beishan granitic rocks satisfactorily.  5. discussion  one of the ﬁndings from the experimental investigations in the previous sections is that the rock porosity has an inﬂuence on the thermal conductivity of the beishan granitic rocks under water saturation, increasing temperature and compression stress conditions, although the porosity of tested rocks is relatively low. it is well known that for low-porosity crystalline rocks, the mineral composition plays an important role in dominating the thermal conductivity. the crystalline rocks are mainly made up of quartz, feldspars, and maﬁc minerals such as pyroxene, amphibole and biotite, and the content of minerals from these three mineral groups basically determines a rock's thermal conductivity (clauser and huenges, 1995). as mentioned in section 2, a model analysis on a total of 46 thin sections of the rocks was conducted to identify the dominant minerals in the rocks. as listed in table 1, the main minerals of these rocks include quartz, plagioclase, k-feldspar and biotite. among these four minerals, quartz has the highest thermal conductivity (7.69 w/mk) while another three minerals have a thermal conductivity range between 1.70 and 2.29 w/mk (horai, 1971). hence, when the porosity values of the specimens in different rock groups are close to each other, quartz content in the rocks may determine the thermal conductivity. according to the data listed in table 2, fig. 17a presents the inﬂuence of quartz content on the average thermal conductivity of different rock groups in dry state. it is seen that except for rock groups bs05 and bs15 (which have relatively large porosity values of 1.37% and 0.68%, respectively), thermal conductivity of the rocks appears an increasing trend with increasing quartz content. when the specimens are subjected to compression stresses, the original pores and cracks in the rocks tend to close, and the effective contact areas between mineral grains increase, leading to a signiﬁcant decay of the porosity effect on the thermal conductivity, especially for rocks with relatively high porosity. on the other hand, the closure of pores and cracks increases the contact opportunity of quartz grains, and hence improves the transportation capability of heat ﬂow in the rocks. under this condition, an obvious increase of the thermal conductivity for all rock groups with increasing quartz content can be observed, as presented in fig. 17b.  6. conclusions  beishan granitic rocks are candidate host rock types for china's hlw repository. in this paper, thermal conductivity characteristics of the beishan granitic rocks have been investigated using the transient plane source (tps) method. the measurement results indicate that for the used eight rock groups with a porosity range from 0.40% to 1.37%, the average thermal conductivity values in the dry state range between 2.412 and 2.812 w/mk. the values under water-saturated condition range from 2.602 to 3.156 w/mk. meanwhile, the effect of water saturation on thermal conductivity presents an increasing trend with an increase of rock porosity. using several mixing models proposed by previous researchers, we found that the hashin–shtrikman mean model showed a reasonably good ﬁt to the experimental data while another three models  currently obtained data, a best ﬁtting equation of axial stressdependent thermal conductivity for these rocks can be expressed as (demırcı et al., 2004) k ¼ k0 þ bσ c  ð11þ  1  where k0 is the thermal conductivity of the rock at zero stress, σ1 is the axial stress, and b and c are ﬁt coefﬁcients, as listed in table 4. analysis of eq. (11) reveals that the coefﬁcient b plays a critical role in controlling the increasing gradient of the thermal conductivity in the initial loading stage (i.e., crack closure stage). the coefﬁcient c dominantly affects the increasing velocity of the thermal conductivity in the subsequent elastic deformation stage. based on experimental investigations on the thermal conductivity of some rocks subjected to uniaxial stresses using a steady-state apparatus developed by demırcı et al. (2004), görgülü et al. (2008) found that the parameters b and c depended on the magnitude of elastic modulus of the rocks, and subsequently established an elastic modulus dependent model to predict the thermal conductivity values under pressure. unfortunately, in the present study, the elastic moduli of the tested rocks have not been available. therefore, the model proposed by görgülü et al. (2008) cannot be used to ﬁt our test results. according to fig. 14, we found that the increasing gradients of the thermal conductivities in the initial loading stage were generally large for the rocks with a high porosity such as rock groups bs05 and bs15. hence, the coefﬁcient b is associated with the rock porosity n, i.e., b increases as n increases, as presented in fig. 15a. an exponential form

thermal conductivity of the rocks under the water-saturated condition. future work is demanded to verify the validity of various mixing models using different rock types with a large porosity range.  with increasing temperature from 25 °c to 150 °c, the thermal conductivity of the rocks shows a decaying trend and the values at 150 °c range from 5.7% to 8.7% lower than those at room temperature, revealing that the inﬂuence of temperature on the thermal conductivity of the tested rocks is limited. in addition, the thermal conductivity of the rocks increases with increasing compression stress in a nonlinear behavior, and the increase rate of the thermal conductivity increases with an increase of rock porosity. it is found that the effects of compression stress and water saturation on the magnitude of thermal conductivity of the rocks are basically comparable. based on the experimental data, the empirical models considering the inﬂuence of rock porosity have been established for predicting the temperature and compression stress dependent thermal conductivity characteristics of the rocks, and the predictions are found to be in good agreement with experimental results. this study thus emphasizes importance of porosity on thermal conductivity measurements even for low porosity crystalline rocks.  when the pores and cracks in the rocks tend to close during compression, quartz content may determine the thermal conductivity, and there exists an increase of the thermal conductivity with increasing quartz content. this is because the closure of pores and cracks increases the contact opportunity of quartz grains, and hence improves the transportation capability of heat ﬂow in the rocks. while the test results provide insights into the thermal conductivity characteristics of beishan granitic rocks, one should be aware of the limitation of this study. because the thermal conductivity of granitic rocks is inﬂuenced by many factors. in order to better understand the thermal conductivity of granitic rocks related to rock characteristics such as rock fabric, grain shape, grain contact and grain size, comprehensive petrographic investigations are recommended in the future. in the meantime, studies should be carried out to understand how the interactions between mineral components affect the thermal conductivity. work is also being conducted to investigate the thermal conductivity of the rocks under coupled thermal-hydro-mechanical conditions.  acknowledgments  this work has been supported by the china atomic energy authority through the

wang, 2014). site selection for china's hlw repository started in 1985 (wang, 2010). the efforts have been focused on potential hlw repository sites located within granite intrusions in mainland china. since 1999, the beijing research  ⁎ corresponding author.  e-mail address: xingguang100@126.com (x.g. zhao).  http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tecto.2016.06.021 0040-1951/© 2016 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.  institute of uranium geology (briug) has performed site characterization studies in the beishan area, china. so far, the beishan area has been considered as the most potential candidate area for china's hlw repository.  among all the engineering properties of crystalline rocks at a potential hlw repository site, the thermal conductivity is one of the most important parameters in design consideration because it has a direct impact on the evaluation of the necessary repository volume and the optimization of the repository layout (sundberg and hellström, 2009). for instance, in the swedish kbs-3 concept for geological disposal of spent fuel, copper canisters with cast iron inserts containing the spent fuel are surrounded by bentonite for isolation and mechanical protection (brantberger et al., 2006). the heat generated by the spent fuel will increase the temperature of all components of the repository. for the bentonite buffer outside the canisters, the peak temperature must not exceed 100 °c. this requirement implies that the canisters cannot be deposited arbitrarily close to each other. on the other hand, unnecessarily large distances between the canisters will mean inefﬁcient and costly use of the repository rock volume (hökmark et al., 2009). to fulﬁll the temperature requirement, the rocks with low thermal conductivities will  \\x0cx.g. zhao et al. / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137  125  lead to a larger distance between canisters than for a case with high thermal conductivities. this is because the rocks with low thermal conductivities will give rise to higher temperatures in the bentonite (sundberg et al., 2008). hence, to design and construct repositories successfully, it is essential to perform an accurate assessment of the thermal conductivity characteristics of the host rock. over the past few decades, various experimental approaches have been employed to measure the thermal conductivity of rocks. the results indicate that the thermal conductivity of rocks is closely associated with mineral composition, porosity, texture, and density, etc. (birch and clark, 1940; clauser and huenges, 1995; hartmann et al., 2005; özkahraman et al., 2004; pasquale et al., 2015; ray et al., 2007; sundberg et al., 2009). for crystalline rocks with relatively homogeneous texture and low porosity, the mineral composition dominates the thermal conductivity. in volcanic and sedimentary rocks, the high variability of porosity in these rocks is a major factor controlling the thermal conductivity (clauser and huenges, 1995; özkahraman et al., 2004). for example, increasing porosity, which acts as barrier to the ﬂow of heat, often results in both lower p-wave velocity and lower thermal conductivity values (özkahraman et al., 2004). for a given rock, water content and temperature have an inﬂuence on its thermal conductivity. generally, the thermal conductivity of the rock increases and decreases with increasing water content (cho and kwon, 2010; cho et al., 2009) and temperature (abdulagatova et al., 2009; birch and clark, 1940; heuze, 1983; miao et al., 2014; mottaghy et al., 2008; vosteen and schellschmidt, 2003), respectively. moreover, the effect of water saturation on the thermal conductivity of rocks shows a generally increasing trend with increasing porosity (nagaraju and roy, 2014). given that the thermal conductivity of surrounding rocks around the excavations will be changed by the excavation-induced stress, some researchers studied the inﬂuence of pressure on the thermal conductivity of rocks (abdulagatova et al., 2010; abdulagatova et al., 2009; demırcı et al., 2004; görgülü et al., 2008; sibbitt, 1976; walsh and decker, 1966; zimmerman, 1989). one of the main ﬁndings achieved from these investigations shows that the thermal conductivity  varies with the pressure exerted on the rock. with increasing applied pressure, the thermal conductivity starts to increase and subsequently the increase rate tends to be a constant value due to gradual closure of cracks and pores within the rock (görgülü et al., 2008; walsh and decker, 1966).  while the above-mentioned studies provide meaningful insight into the thermal conductivity of various rocks, the thermal conductivity characteristics of low-porosity crystalline rocks subjected to different external factors such as water saturation, temperature and compression stress have not been fully understood. on the other hand, the information on the thermal conductivity of rocks in a potential hlw repository site must be known with sufﬁcient conﬁdence to provide necessary input conditions for its long-term safety assessment, which is one of the motivations for this study. in this work, experimental investigations on the thermal conductivity of the beishan granitic rocks are conducted using the transient plane source (tps) method. in the following discussion, rock sampling and basic physical properties of the rock specimens are introduced ﬁrst. testing facilities and procedures are then described. subsequently, the water saturation, temperature and compression stress dependent thermal conductivity characteristics of the tested rocks are evaluated comprehensively, and ﬁnally some insights are obtained.  2. rock sampling and preparation  the beishan area is situated in gansu province of northwestern china (see fig. 1). after a long geological evolution and weathering process, the topography of this area is characterized by a ﬂat gobi and small gentle rolling hills with elevations ranging between 1400 and 2000 m above the sea level. the crust in this area possesses a blocky structure with many granite intrusions (see fig. 2). other surrounding rocks include mainly metamorphic and sedimentary rocks, as well as quaternary cover. rock sampling was carried out in the jijicao and xinchang rock blocks, which are currently considered as two of the key investigation sub-areas during site selection and characterization.  fig. 1. geographical location of the beishan area and a photo showing its typical topography.  \\x0c126  x.g. zhao et al. / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137  xinchang  bs06  bs18  bs19  jijicao  bs16  bs15  bs05  n  2.5 km  granitic rock  sedimentary rock  metamorphic rock  quaternary cover  borehole  fault  fig. 2. rock sampling from six boreholes in the jijicao and xinchang sub-areas for thermal conductivity measurements.  intact drill cores with a diameter of approximately 63 mm were taken from six sub-vertical boreholes (i.e., boreholes bs05, bs06, bs15, bs16, bs18 and bs19) in these two sub-areas. the borehole locations are presented in fig. 2.  field observations indicated that the collected granitic rocks were relatively isotropic in texture and mineralogical composition. to evaluate the geological nature of the rocks, a series of thin sections were prepared and then exposed to cross-polarized light under an optical microscope to identify the dominant minerals in the rocks. the percentages of the dominant minerals were determined by point counting on thin sections. for each thin section approximately 500 points covering phenocrysts and groundmass were counted. according to the quartz-alkali feldspar-plagioclase (qap) diagram (streckeisen, 1976), the rocks can further be classiﬁed. it can be observed from fig. 3 that the rocks contain mainly a moderate to low amount of quartz and alkali feldspar, and a moderate to high amount of plagioclase. this means that the collected rocks dominantly range from granodiorite to monzogranite. for grain size characteristics, the rocks are from ﬁne grained to, medium to coarse grained. an overview of the basic information of the rocks is listed in table 1. based on the borehole no. and sampling depth, these rocks have been divided into eight groups.  a total of 47 pairs of rock specimens, 50 mm in diameter, were prepared from the drill cores with a length to diameter ratio of approximately 0.5. in particular, specimen ends were polished carefully using a  q  90          90  i - granodiorite ii - monzogranite  60                                   60          ii         i    bs05 bs06 bs15 bs16 bs18-1 bs18-2 bs19-1 bs19-2  20                                                                     20  5                                                                                  5 p  10                 35                       65                  90  a  fig. 3. qap classiﬁcation of the eight rock groups based on modal analysis.  grinding machine until the ﬂatness and roughness of the ends are less than 10 μm and 3 μm, respectively. the ﬂat and polished specimen end surfaces minimize the thermal contact resistance during thermal conductivity measurement. a minimum of ten specimens for each rock group were prepared.  3. test methodology  3.1. an introduction to the used tps method  in the ﬁelds of geology and geophysics, laboratory approaches to measuring soil and rock thermal conductivity can mainly be divided into two groups: steady state and transient state. in this work, the transient plane source (tps) method (gustafsson, 1991; log and gustafsson, 1995) was utilized to measure the thermal conductivity of the specimens. as one of the transient measurement methods, the tps technique is based on the use of a transiently heated plane sensor (i.e., hot disk sensor) and a hot disk thermal constants analyser (see fig. 4a). the used hot disk tps2500s system can measure thermal conductivity of materials ranging from 0.01 to 400 w/mk. the hot disk sensor consists of a continuous double spiral, which is etched out of a thin nickel foil (fig. 4e). this spiral is sandwiched between two sheets of electrical insulation materials made of kapton. the sensor acts both as a heat source for increasing the temperature of the specimens and as a dynamic temperature sensor for recording the temperature increase. during the measurement, the temperature in the sensor rises and heat starts to ﬂow to the specimens. the temperature rise in the sensor provides an indicator of the thermal properties of the specimens. if the specimens have good thermal conducting properties, the heat will be transported rapidly inside the specimens. on the contrary, if the specimens have good thermal insulation properties, the sensor temperature will rise faster and the heat will not be transported as much as in the test of the good thermal conducting specimens. compared with steady state measurement methods such as the divided bar (beck and beck, 1958; birch, 1950; sass et al., 1971) and the guarded hot plate (abdulagatova et al., 2009; alishaev et al., 2012), one of significant advantages of the tps technique is that the thermal conductivity of materials can be measured more quickly, typically from several to tens of seconds. hence, a long wait for thermal gradients to equilibrate is not required and the moisture migration in response to temperature gradients was minimized (jackson and taylor, 1986). on the other hand, unlike some transient methods such as thermal needle probes (barry-macaulay et al., 2013; von herzen and maxwell, 1959), which are commonly used for soils and soft rocks, the tps method can be  \\x0cx.g. zhao et al. / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137  127  table 1 basic information and geological description of the tested rocks.  rock type and group  basic information  mineral composition  naked eye observation  photomicrograph of a thin section  monzogranite (bs05)  location: jijicao borehole no.: bs05 sampling depth: 5–7 m number of specimen pairs: 7 grain size: medium  plagioclase: 33.7% ± 5.8%;

popov et al., 2003). hence, the thermal resistance between the specimen ends and the sensor exists (see section 3.2). so far, the tps technology has been widely used to  \\x0c128  x.g. zhao et al. / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137  a   c   temperature control system  b   hot disk thermal   constants analyser   sensor   platen   specimens  d   e   specimens  insulation material  chamber   sensor   specimens   oil bath   sensor   double spiral  cable extension  fig. 4. the hot disk tps2500s system (a) used to measure the thermal conductivity of specimens under room temperature (d), high temperature (c), and uniaxial compression (b) conditions. a hot disk sensor showing its key components (e).  determine the thermal properties of different materials (lagüela et al., 2015;

θ ¼ a2=d  where t is the time measured from the start of the transient recording, θ is the characteristic time, which depends both on parameters of the sensor and the sample, and d is the thermal diffusivity of the sample.  according to eq. (2), and δtðτþ and d(τ) plotted as a function of τ provides a linear relationship with a slope that is a function of p0, a, and k. thermal conductivity k can be obtained by ﬁtting the experimental data to the straight line given by eq. (2); thermal diffusivity d is calculated from eq. (3) taking into account the τ value determined in the previous ﬁt.  as mentioned above, the solution of the thermal conductivity equation is based on the assumption that the hot disk sensor is located in an inﬁnite material in perfect contact with the sensor surface. this means that the heat ﬂow generated from each measurement must not reach the outside boundaries of the specimen (hot disk, 2007). meanwhile, a careful preparation of specimen ends is required to minimize thermal contact resistance. an estimation of how far the heat ﬂow has proceeded in the specimen during a recording is the probing depth δp, which is deﬁned as (hot disk, 2007):  ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ p dt  δp ¼ 2  ð4þ  to determine the thermal conductivity with good accuracy, the shortest distance from any part of the sensor to the nearest outside boundary of the sample should be larger than δp. in our experiments, the used hot disk sensor has a radius of 6.403 mm. the shortest distance is about 19 mm, and the probing depth is approximately 10 mm. for this probing depth value, we can consider that we are conducting a bulk measurement.  3.3. test procedures  3.3.1. tests on specimens under saturated and dry conditions  firstly, the specimens were immersed by deionized water in a vacuum for a period of 96 h. the specimens were then taken from the vacuum and the water droplets on the surfaces were wiped dry, care being taken to ensure that no rock grains or fragments were lost. the mass of the water-saturated specimens (msat) was measured using a  \\x0cx.g. zhao et al. / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137  129

constant under vacuum within 72 h (see fig. 5), indicating that the specimens were saturated with water. subsequently, the hot disk sensor was horizontally placed between the two saturated specimen pieces with the double spiral centered and totally covered, and the two specimen pieces were ﬁrmly clamped together to ensure that there was no air gap between the sensor and the specimen end surfaces, as presented in fig. 4d. in order to remain water saturation, the saturated specimens and the sensor were kept in a plastic bag during thermal conductivity measurement (adl-zarrabi, 2004). after the test, the used water-saturated specimens were suffered from dehydration treatment in a thermostatic drying oven at 105 °c for a period of 24 h and subsequently cooled in a desiccator to measure the thermal conductivity under a dry condition. meanwhile, the mass of the dry specimens (mdry) was measured, and the porosity (n) of the specimens was calculated using the equations  n ¼ 100v p  v %  v p ¼ msat − mdry  ρw  ð5þ  ð6þ  where v is the bulk rock volume, vp is the pore volume, and ρw is the density of water. for each pair of specimens saturated or dried, measurements on the thermal conductivity were carried out at room temperature (25 ± 1 °c).  3.3.2. tests on specimens under increasing temperature  to investigate the effect of temperature on the thermal conductivity of the tested rocks, measurements were performed on dry specimens from 40 °c to 150 °c based on the requirements of the used test equipment. compared with measurements at room temperature, the experiments under high temperature are time consuming due to a slow stepwise heating process by using a constant temperature oil bath and a temperature control system, as shown in fig. 4c. the thermal conductivity measurement can only be conducted until the two specimen pieces in the chamber with a specimen holder within the oil bath have reached thermal equilibrium and kept a target temperature value. during thermal equilibrium of the oil bath, the hot disk sensor monitors continuously the temperature variation of the specimens. for our tests, the thermal conductivity of the specimens was measured when the recorded temperature variation of the specimens is less than 0.04 °c. in general, 32 h were needed to complete one test. a typical temperature-time history during the test is

measurement, the load was maintained constant for a period of about 15 min to avoid residual temperature drifts on the specimens. based on the in-situ stress measurement results obtained from the beishan area (zhao et al., 2013), the maximum axial compression stress applied to the specimens was set to be 45 mpa to approximately simulate the excavation-induced stress near the vertical hlw disposal element boundary at a depth of 600 m. the axial stress applied to the specimens was recorded automatically, and the used stress path throughout the course of testing is presented in fig. 7. the experiments were conducted at room temperature.  according to previous experimental results (zhao et al., 2015a; zhao et al., 2015b), the identiﬁed crack initiation stresses of cylindrical specimens of beishan granitic rocks under uniaxial compression using the cumulative ae hit (caeh) method range from 45.3 to 109.1 mpa, which are larger than the maximum compression stress adopted in the present study. hence, the stress-induced rock damage might not occur in the tested specimens during loading. it should be mentioned that in the process of loading, the friction may occur at the interfaces between the specimen ends and the sensor. due to limitation of the tps measurement technique, the utilized test method does not consider the potential inﬂuence of interface friction effect on the experimental results. to reduce or eliminate the friction effect, further efforts are needed to produce innovative design for the test equipment. although not perfect, the developed test system provides a feasible means for us to gain insight into thermal conductivity behaviors of rocks under compression.  4. test results  4.1. inﬂuence of water saturation on the thermal conductivity  table

content of the specimens, leading to difﬁculties in evaluating the relationship between the thermal conductivity and the water saturation degree of the specimens quantitatively.  3.3.3. tests on specimens under uniaxial compression  the uniaxial compression tests on dry specimens were conducted using a hydraulic servo-controlled compression machine. for each test, two specimen pieces with the hot disk sensor were contained between steel platens machined to match their end surfaces, as shown in fig. 4b. the interfaces between the specimens and the steel platens were daubed with a thin layer of lubricant to reduce the end effect of the platens during loading. when the experimental setup was completed, axial-load control was used with a loading rate of 100 n/s and the axial load was increased with an increment  thermal conductivity measurements were carried out on the 40 pairs of specimens both in dry and water-saturated conditions, and the results are listed in table 2. a statistical analysis shows that for the eight rock groups under dry or saturated state, the standard deviation (sd) and coefﬁcient of variation (cov) of the thermal conductivity are all less than 0.06 w/mk and 4%, respectively, indicating that the results between specimens in each rock group have a good consistency. for all rock groups, the average thermal conductivity values in the dry state (kdry) range between 2.412 and 2.812 w/mk. the values under watersaturated condition (ksat) for the same set of specimens range from  130  x.g. zhao et al. / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137

the dry specimens were saturated with water, water with a higher thermal conductivity (0.604 w/mk) replaced the air with a lower thermal conductivity (0.025 w/mk) in the void of the rocks, leading to an increase of the thermal conductivity. for our data set, the mean thermal conductivity values  of the saturated specimens in different rocks groups range from 6.5% to 24.2% higher than those of dry ones. as presented in fig. 8, for the rock groups (i.e., bs06, bs16, bs18-1, bs18-2, bs19-1 and bs19-2) with an average porosity range between 0.40% and 0.52%, the inﬂuence of water saturation on the

 to 150 °c. the thermal conductivity of these specimens at room temperature (25 °c) was also measured and the data were added to this ﬁgure. it is seen that the thermal conductivity of the specimens shows a decaying trend with increasing temperature, and the values at 150 °c range from 5.7% to 8.7% lower than those at room temperature. this means that within the used temperature range, the inﬂuence of the increasing temperature on the decay of thermal conductivity for these rocks is limited. on the other hand, a possible reason for the gradual decrease in thermal conductivity is the generation of thermally induced microcracks in the rocks because of a mismatch between thermal expansion coefﬁcients of adjacent mineral grains in a homogeneous temperature ﬁeld (jansen et al., 1993), which has been demonstrated from a microcracking perspective based on numerical simulations (zhao, 2016). based on the experimental data, the relationship between thermal conductivity and temperature can be described using the equation: k ¼ kr − at2  ð8þ  where kr is the thermal conductivity of the rock at room temperature (25 °c), t is the temperature in celsius, and a is the ﬁt coefﬁcient (see

(2013), the abovementioned mixing models were used to predict the thermal conductivity values of the tested rocks in the water-saturated state. fig. 9 shows the comparison between measured and calculated thermal conductivities for the four different models. it can be observed from fig. 9a, b, and d that the geometric mean, the arithmetic mean, and the effectivemedium mean yield similar prediction results and consistently underestimate the thermal conductivity of the eight rock groups, especially for the groups with relatively high porosity values (e.g., groups bs05 and bs15). the hashin–shtrikman mean shows a reasonably good ﬁt for all rock groups, as shown in fig. 9c. the analysis results are basically in line with observations reported by fuchs et al. (2013) because most of the evaluated mixing models used in their analysis also underestimate the thermal conductivity of the rocks. however, the geometric mean model was rated as the best ﬁt to their data set. it should be noted that the rocks used in their analysis covered different rock types with a large range in porosity, from almost zero to about 30%. in addition, the measured thermal conductivity values of these rocks spans the interval between 1.0 and 6.5 w/mk. the present investigations focused mainly on the granitic rocks with low porosities and a narrow thermal conductivity range. hence, the large difference of rock properties may result in uncertainties between analysis results obtained from various mixing models. more work is required to explain this discrepancy.  nagaraju and roy (2014) deﬁned the effect of water saturation on thermal conductivity (s) as a function of porosity of rocks, and s is expressed by s ¼ ksat − kdry  ð7þ  kdry  according to the measurement results listed in table 2, we established the relationship between s and the porosity of the rocks, as presented in fig. 10. analysis of fig. 10 reveals that the effect of water saturation on thermal conductivity of rocks presents an increasing trend with an increase of porosity. a linear form expression can ﬁt the data reasonably well while ensuring that the line passes through the origin.  4.2. inﬂuence of temperature on the thermal conductivity  fig. 11 presents the variation of thermal conductivity of seven pairs of dry specimens in different rock groups with temperature from 40 °c  table 3 fit coefﬁcient a for thermal conductivity-temperature curves of seven pairs of specimens in different rock groups.  rock type and specimen no.  monzogranite (bs05-07) granodiorite (bs06-05) monzogranite (bs15-07) granodiorite (bs16-05) monzogranite (bs18-1-08) granodiorite (bs18-2-05) monzogranite (bs19-1-07)  a (10−6)  8.821 5.679 8.394 4.871 6.891 5.728 6.385  r2  0.9830 0.9334 0.9853 0.9289 0.9262 0.9581 0.9933  132  x.g. zhao et al. / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137  \\x0cx.g. zhao et al. / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137  133  n=2  20  10 axial stress (mpa)  30  40  n=3  20  10 axial stress (mpa)  30  40  50  50  3.4  3.3  3.2  3.1  3.0  2.9  2.8  2.7  2.6  2.5  2.4  c  thermal conductivity (w/mk)  50  0  f  2.9  2.8  2.7  2.6  2.5  2.4  thermal conductivity (w/mk)  50  0  n=3  20  10 axial stress (mpa)  30  40  n=3  20  10 axial stress (mpa)  30  40  bs05 bs06 bs15 bs16 bs18-1 bs18-2 bs19-1 bs19-2  y=24.15-24.99e-x (r2=0.9296)  21  18  15  12  0369  i  r(%)   n=1  20  10 axial stress (mpa)  30  40  50  0.0  0.3  0.9  1.2 0.6 porosity (%)  1.5  1.8  b  3.0  2.9  2.8  2.7  2.6  2.5  2.4  thermal conductivity (w/mk)  50  0  3.2e 3.1  3.0  2.9  2.8  2.7  2.6  2.5  2.4  thermal conductivity (w/mk)  50  0  3.2h  3.1  3.0  2.9  2.8  2.7  2.6  thermal conductivity (w/mk)  50  0  n=3  20  10 axial stress (mpa)  30  40  n=3  20  10 axial stress (mpa)  30  40  n=2  20  10 axial stress (mpa)  30  40  3.0  2.9  2.8  2.7  2.6  2.5  2.4  2.3  2.2  a  thermal conductivity (w/mk)  3.0d 2.9  2.8  2.7  2.6  2.5  2.4  2.3  2.2  2.1  2.0  thermal conductivity (w/mk)  3.0g  2.9  2.8  2.7  2.6  2.5  2.4  thermal conductivity (w/mk)  0  0  0  fig. 14. inﬂuence of axial compression stress on the thermal conductivity of the eight rock groups: (a) bs05, (b) bs06, (c) bs15, (d) bs16, (e) bs18-1, (f) bs18-2, (g) bs19-1 and (h) bs19-2, and variation of the increase rate of the thermal conductivity (r) with rock porosity (i). error bars indicate the standard deviation of the thermal conductivity. n in the ﬁgures represents the number of specimen pairs in each rock group.  we attempted to relate a with other rock parameters and found that a depended on the magnitude of rock porosity (n), as presented in fig. 12. the coefﬁcient a varies with porosity n according to the following equation: a ¼ 9:43 − 0:71=n2  ð9þ  according to eqs.

(11) is not sensitive to the variation of rock porosity, and is within the range from 0.20 to 0.27 except for the rock group bs19-1. for simplicity, an average value of c = 0.24 obtained from table 4 is used to approximately describe the trend, as shown in fig. 15b. using eqs. (11)–(12) and the constant coefﬁcient c, an overall ﬁt is made for these rock groups to reproduce the rock porosity-dependent thermal conductivity under different axial stresses. a comparison between individual and overall ﬁt results is presented in fig. 16. it is found that for each rock group subjected to different compression stresses, the difference of the thermal conductivity values from the individual and overall ﬁts is less than 0.05 w/mk. the good agreement indicates that the established rock porosity-dependent model can capture the nonlinear stress-thermal conductivity relationships of the beishan granitic rocks satisfactorily.  5. discussion  one of the ﬁndings from the experimental investigations in the previous sections is that the rock porosity has an inﬂuence on the thermal conductivity of the beishan granitic rocks under water saturation, increasing temperature and compression stress conditions, although the porosity of tested rocks is relatively low. it is well known that for low-porosity crystalline rocks, the mineral composition plays an important role in dominating the thermal conductivity. the crystalline rocks are mainly made up of quartz, feldspars, and maﬁc minerals such as pyroxene, amphibole and biotite, and the content of minerals from these three mineral groups basically determines a rock's thermal conductivity (clauser and huenges, 1995). as mentioned in section 2, a model analysis on a total of 46 thin sections of the rocks was conducted to identify the dominant minerals in the rocks. as listed in table 1, the main minerals of these rocks include quartz, plagioclase, k-feldspar and biotite. among these four minerals, quartz has the highest thermal conductivity (7.69 w/mk) while another three minerals have a thermal conductivity range between 1.70 and 2.29 w/mk (horai, 1971). hence, when the porosity values of the specimens in different rock groups are close to each other, quartz content in the rocks may determine the thermal conductivity. according to the data listed in table 2, fig. 17a presents the inﬂuence of quartz content on the average thermal conductivity of different rock groups in dry state. it is seen that except for rock groups bs05 and bs15 (which have relatively large porosity values of 1.37% and 0.68%, respectively), thermal conductivity of the rocks appears an increasing trend with increasing quartz content. when the specimens are subjected to compression stresses, the original pores and cracks in the rocks tend to close, and the effective contact areas between mineral grains increase, leading to a signiﬁcant decay of the porosity effect on the thermal conductivity, especially for rocks with relatively high porosity. on the other hand, the closure of pores and cracks increases the contact opportunity of quartz grains, and hence improves the transportation capability of heat ﬂow in the rocks. under this condition, an obvious increase of the thermal conductivity for all rock groups with increasing quartz content can be observed, as presented in fig. 17b.  6. conclusions  beishan granitic rocks are candidate host rock types for china's hlw repository. in this paper, thermal conductivity characteristics of the beishan granitic rocks have been investigated using the transient plane source (tps) method. the measurement results indicate that for the used eight rock groups with a porosity range from 0.40% to 1.37%, the average thermal conductivity values in the dry state range between 2.412 and 2.812 w/mk. the values under water-saturated condition range from 2.602 to 3.156 w/mk. meanwhile, the effect of water saturation on thermal conductivity presents an increasing trend with an increase of rock porosity. using several mixing models proposed by previous researchers, we found that the hashin–shtrikman mean model showed a reasonably good ﬁt to the experimental data while another three models  currently obtained data, a best ﬁtting equation of axial stressdependent thermal conductivity for these rocks can be expressed as (demırcı et al., 2004) k ¼ k0 þ bσ c  ð11þ  1  where k0 is the thermal conductivity of the rock at zero stress, σ1 is the axial stress, and b and c are ﬁt coefﬁcients, as listed in table 4. analysis of eq. (11) reveals that the coefﬁcient b plays a critical role in controlling the increasing gradient of the thermal conductivity in the initial loading stage (i.e., crack closure stage). the coefﬁcient c dominantly affects the increasing velocity of the thermal conductivity in the subsequent elastic deformation stage. based on experimental investigations on the thermal conductivity of some rocks subjected to uniaxial stresses using a steady-state apparatus developed by demırcı et al. (2004), görgülü et al. (2008) found that the parameters b and c depended on the magnitude of elastic modulus of the rocks, and subsequently established an elastic modulus dependent model to predict the thermal conductivity values under pressure. unfortunately, in the present study, the elastic moduli of the tested rocks have not been available. therefore, the model proposed by görgülü et al. (2008) cannot be used to ﬁt our test results. according to fig. 14, we found that the increasing gradients of the thermal conductivities in the initial loading stage were generally large for the rocks with a high porosity such as rock groups bs05 and bs15. hence, the coefﬁcient b is associated with the rock porosity n, i.e., b increases as n increases, as presented in fig. 15a. an exponential form

thermal conductivity of the rocks under the water-saturated condition. future work is demanded to verify the validity of various mixing models using different rock types with a large porosity range.  with increasing temperature from 25 °c to 150 °c, the thermal conductivity of the rocks shows a decaying trend and the values at 150 °c range from 5.7% to 8.7% lower than those at room temperature, revealing that the inﬂuence of temperature on the thermal conductivity of the tested rocks is limited. in addition, the thermal conductivity of the rocks increases with increasing compression stress in a nonlinear behavior, and the increase rate of the thermal conductivity increases with an increase of rock porosity. it is found that the effects of compression stress and water saturation on the magnitude of thermal conductivity of the rocks are basically comparable. based on the experimental data, the empirical models considering the inﬂuence of rock porosity have been established for predicting the temperature and compression stress dependent thermal conductivity characteristics of the rocks, and the predictions are found to be in good agreement with experimental results. this study thus emphasizes importance of porosity on thermal conductivity measurements even for low porosity crystalline rocks.  when the pores and cracks in the rocks tend to close during compression, quartz content may determine the thermal conductivity, and there exists an increase of the thermal conductivity with increasing quartz content. this is because the closure of pores and cracks increases the contact opportunity of quartz grains, and hence improves the transportation capability of heat ﬂow in the rocks. while the test results provide insights into the thermal conductivity characteristics of beishan granitic rocks, one should be aware of the limitation of this study. because the thermal conductivity of granitic rocks is inﬂuenced by many factors. in order to better understand the thermal conductivity of granitic rocks related to rock characteristics such as rock fabric, grain shape, grain contact and grain size, comprehensive petrographic investigations are recommended in the future. in the meantime, studies should be carried out to understand how the interactions between mineral components affect the thermal conductivity. work is also being conducted to investigate the thermal conductivity of the rocks under coupled thermal-hydro-mechanical conditions.  acknowledgments  this work has been supported by the china atomic energy authority through the

wang, 2014). site selection for china's hlw repository started in 1985 (wang, 2010). the efforts have been focused on potential hlw repository sites located within granite intrusions in mainland china. since 1999, the beijing research ⁎ corresponding author. e-mail address: xingguang100@126.com (x.g. zhao). http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tecto.2016.06.021 0040-1951/© 2016 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved. institute of uranium geology (briug) has performed site characterization studies in the beishan area, china. so far, the beishan area has been considered as the most potential candidate area for china's hlw repository. among all the engineering properties of crystalline rocks at a potential hlw repository site, the thermal conductivity is one of the most important parameters in design consideration because it has a direct impact on the evaluation of the necessary repository volume and the optimization of the repository layout (sundberg and hellström, 2009). for instance, in the swedish kbs-3 concept for geological disposal of spent fuel, copper canisters with cast iron inserts containing the spent fuel are surrounded by bentonite for isolation and mechanical protection (brantberger et al., 2006). the heat generated by the spent fuel will increase the temperature of all components of the repository. for the bentonite buffer outside the canisters, the peak temperature must not exceed 100 °c. this requirement implies that the canisters cannot be deposited arbitrarily close to each other. on the other hand, unnecessarily large distances between the canisters will mean inefﬁcient and costly use of the repository rock volume (hökmark et al., 2009). to fulﬁll the temperature requirement, the rocks with low thermal conductivities will\\x0cx.g. zhao et al. / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137 125 lead to a larger distance between canisters than for a case with high thermal conductivities. this is because the rocks with low thermal conductivities will give rise to higher temperatures in the bentonite (sundberg et al., 2008). hence, to design and construct repositories successfully, it is essential to perform an accurate assessment of the thermal conductivity characteristics of the host rock. over the past few decades, various experimental approaches have been employed to measure the thermal conductivity of rocks. the results indicate that the thermal conductivity of rocks is closely associated with mineral composition, porosity, texture, and density, etc. (birch and clark, 1940; clauser and huenges, 1995; hartmann et al., 2005; özkahraman et al., 2004; pasquale et al., 2015; ray et al., 2007; sundberg et al., 2009). for crystalline rocks with relatively homogeneous texture and low porosity, the mineral composition dominates the thermal conductivity. in volcanic and sedimentary rocks, the high variability of porosity in these rocks is a major factor controlling the thermal conductivity (clauser and huenges, 1995; özkahraman et al., 2004). for example, increasing porosity, which acts as barrier to the ﬂow of heat, often results in both lower p-wave velocity and lower thermal conductivity values (özkahraman et al., 2004). for a given rock, water content and temperature have an inﬂuence on its thermal conductivity. generally, the thermal conductivity of the rock increases and decreases with increasing water content (cho and kwon, 2010; cho et al., 2009) and temperature (abdulagatova et al., 2009; birch and clark, 1940; heuze, 1983; miao et al., 2014; mottaghy et al., 2008; vosteen and schellschmidt, 2003), respectively. moreover, the effect of water saturation on the thermal conductivity of rocks shows a generally increasing trend with increasing porosity (nagaraju and roy, 2014). given that the thermal conductivity of surrounding rocks around the excavations will be changed by the excavation-induced stress, some researchers studied the inﬂuence of pressure on the thermal conductivity of rocks (abdulagatova et al., 2010; abdulagatova et al., 2009; demırcı et al., 2004; görgülü et al., 2008; sibbitt, 1976; walsh and decker, 1966; zimmerman, 1989). one of the main ﬁndings achieved from these investigations shows that the thermal conductivity varies with the pressure exerted on the rock. with increasing applied pressure, the thermal conductivity starts to increase and subsequently the increase rate tends to be a constant value due to gradual closure of cracks and pores within the rock (görgülü et al., 2008; walsh and decker, 1966). while the above-mentioned studies provide meaningful insight into the thermal conductivity of various rocks, the thermal conductivity characteristics of low-porosity crystalline rocks subjected to different external factors such as water saturation, temperature and compression stress have not been fully understood. on the other hand, the information on the thermal conductivity of rocks in a potential hlw repository site must be known with sufﬁcient conﬁdence to provide necessary input conditions for its long-term safety assessment, which is one of the motivations for this study. in this work, experimental investigations on the thermal conductivity of the beishan granitic rocks are conducted using the transient plane source (tps) method. in the following discussion, rock sampling and basic physical properties of the rock specimens are introduced ﬁrst. testing facilities and procedures are then described. subsequently, the water saturation, temperature and compression stress dependent thermal conductivity characteristics of the tested rocks are evaluated comprehensively, and ﬁnally some insights are obtained. 2. rock sampling and preparation the beishan area is situated in gansu province of northwestern china (see fig. 1). after a long geological evolution and weathering process, the topography of this area is characterized by a ﬂat gobi and small gentle rolling hills with elevations ranging between 1400 and 2000 m above the sea level. the crust in this area possesses a blocky structure with many granite intrusions (see fig. 2). other surrounding rocks include mainly metamorphic and sedimentary rocks, as well as quaternary cover. rock sampling was carried out in the jijicao and xinchang rock blocks, which are currently considered as two of the key investigation sub-areas during site selection and characterization. fig. 1. geographical location of the beishan area and a photo showing its typical topography.\\x0c126 x.g. zhao et al. / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137 xinchang bs06 bs18 bs19 jijicao bs16 bs15 bs05 n 2.5 km granitic rock sedimentary rock metamorphic rock quaternary cover borehole fault fig. 2. rock sampling from six boreholes in the jijicao and xinchang sub-areas for thermal conductivity measurements. intact drill cores with a diameter of approximately 63 mm were taken from six sub-vertical boreholes (i.e., boreholes bs05, bs06, bs15, bs16, bs18 and bs19) in these two sub-areas. the borehole locations are presented in fig. 2. field observations indicated that the collected granitic rocks were relatively isotropic in texture and mineralogical composition. to evaluate the geological nature of the rocks, a series of thin sections were prepared and then exposed to cross-polarized light under an optical microscope to identify the dominant minerals in the rocks. the percentages of the dominant minerals were determined by point counting on thin sections. for each thin section approximately 500 points covering phenocrysts and groundmass were counted. according to the quartz-alkali feldspar-plagioclase (qap) diagram (streckeisen, 1976), the rocks can further be classiﬁed. it can be observed from fig. 3 that the rocks contain mainly a moderate to low amount of quartz and alkali feldspar, and a moderate to high amount of plagioclase. this means that the collected rocks dominantly range from granodiorite to monzogranite. for grain size characteristics, the rocks are from ﬁne grained to, medium to coarse grained. an overview of the basic information of the rocks is listed in table 1. based on the borehole no. and sampling depth, these rocks have been divided into eight groups. a total of 47 pairs of rock specimens, 50 mm in diameter, were prepared from the drill cores with a length to diameter ratio of approximately 0.5. in particular, specimen ends were polished carefully using a q 90 90 i - granodiorite ii - monzogranite 60 60 ii i bs05 bs06 bs15 bs16 bs18-1 bs18-2 bs19-1 bs19-2 20 20 5 5 p 10 35 65 90 a fig. 3. qap classiﬁcation of the eight rock groups based on modal analysis. grinding machine until the ﬂatness and roughness of the ends are less than 10 μm and 3 μm, respectively. the ﬂat and polished specimen end surfaces minimize the thermal contact resistance during thermal conductivity measurement. a minimum of ten specimens for each rock group were prepared. 3. test methodology 3.1. an introduction to the used tps method in the ﬁelds of geology and geophysics, laboratory approaches to measuring soil and rock thermal conductivity can mainly be divided into two groups: steady state and transient state. in this work, the transient plane source (tps) method (gustafsson, 1991; log and gustafsson, 1995) was utilized to measure the thermal conductivity of the specimens. as one of the transient measurement methods, the tps technique is based on the use of a transiently heated plane sensor (i.e., hot disk sensor) and a hot disk thermal constants analyser (see fig. 4a). the used hot disk tps2500s system can measure thermal conductivity of materials ranging from 0.01 to 400 w/mk. the hot disk sensor consists of a continuous double spiral, which is etched out of a thin nickel foil (fig. 4e). this spiral is sandwiched between two sheets of electrical insulation materials made of kapton. the sensor acts both as a heat source for increasing the temperature of the specimens and as a dynamic temperature sensor for recording the temperature increase. during the measurement, the temperature in the sensor rises and heat starts to ﬂow to the specimens. the temperature rise in the sensor provides an indicator of the thermal properties of the specimens. if the specimens have good thermal conducting properties, the heat will be transported rapidly inside the specimens. on the contrary, if the specimens have good thermal insulation properties, the sensor temperature will rise faster and the heat will not be transported as much as in the test of the good thermal conducting specimens. compared with steady state measurement methods such as the divided bar (beck and beck, 1958; birch, 1950; sass et al., 1971) and the guarded hot plate (abdulagatova et al., 2009; alishaev et al., 2012), one of significant advantages of the tps technique is that the thermal conductivity of materials can be measured more quickly, typically from several to tens of seconds. hence, a long wait for thermal gradients to equilibrate is not required and the moisture migration in response to temperature gradients was minimized (jackson and taylor, 1986). on the other hand, unlike some transient methods such as thermal needle probes (barry-macaulay et al., 2013; von herzen and maxwell, 1959), which are commonly used for soils and soft rocks, the tps method can be\\x0cx.g. zhao et al. / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137 127 table 1 basic information and geological description of the tested rocks. rock type and group basic information mineral composition naked eye observation photomicrograph of a thin section monzogranite (bs05) location: jijicao borehole no.: bs05 sampling depth: 5–7 m number of specimen pairs: 7 grain size: medium plagioclase: 33.7% ± 5.8%;

popov et al., 2003). hence, the thermal resistance between the specimen ends and the sensor exists (see section 3.2). so far, the tps technology has been widely used to\\x0c128 x.g. zhao et al. / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137 a c temperature control system b hot disk thermal constants analyser sensor platen specimens d e specimens insulation material chamber sensor specimens oil bath sensor double spiral cable extension fig. 4. the hot disk tps2500s system (a) used to measure the thermal conductivity of specimens under room temperature (d), high temperature (c), and uniaxial compression (b) conditions. a hot disk sensor showing its key components (e). determine the thermal properties of different materials (lagüela et al., 2015; solórzano et al., 2008; urquhart and bauer, 2015; xu et al., 2014; yang et al., 2012). 3.2. theory of the tps technique to theoretically describe how the tps method behaves, the thermal conductivity equation can be solved assuming that the hot disk sensor consists of a certain number of concentric ring heat sources located in an inﬁnitely large sample (hot disk, 2007). a constant electric power supplied to the sensor results in an increase in temperature which is directly related to the variation in the sensor resistance (r(t)) by the equation: \\x10 \\x11 r tð þ ¼ r0 1 þ αδt τð þ ð1þ where r0 is the nickel electrical resistance in the beginning of the recording, α is the temperature coefﬁcient of resistance of the nickel foil, and δtðτþ is the mean value of temperature rise in the sensor due to a constant current pulse given by: \\x10 δt τð þ ¼ p0 π3=2ak \\x11−1d τð þ ð2þ where p0 is the total output of power from the sensor, a is the sensor radius, k is the thermal conductivity of the sample that is being tested and d(τ) is a dimensionless time dependent function with: τ ¼ t=θð ð3þ þ1=2; θ ¼ a2=d where t is the time measured from the start of the transient recording, θ is the characteristic time, which depends both on parameters of the sensor and the sample, and d is the thermal diffusivity of the sample. according to eq. (2), and δtðτþ and d(τ) plotted as a function of τ provides a linear relationship with a slope that is a function of p0, a, and k. thermal conductivity k can be obtained by ﬁtting the experimental data to the straight line given by eq. (2); thermal diffusivity d is calculated from eq. (3) taking into account the τ value determined in the previous ﬁt. as mentioned above, the solution of the thermal conductivity equation is based on the assumption that the hot disk sensor is located in an inﬁnite material in perfect contact with the sensor surface. this means that the heat ﬂow generated from each measurement must not reach the outside boundaries of the specimen (hot disk, 2007). meanwhile, a careful preparation of specimen ends is required to minimize thermal contact resistance. an estimation of how far the heat ﬂow has proceeded in the specimen during a recording is the probing depth δp, which is deﬁned as (hot disk, 2007): ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ p dt δp ¼ 2 ð4þ to determine the thermal conductivity with good accuracy, the shortest distance from any part of the sensor to the nearest outside boundary of the sample should be larger than δp. in our experiments, the used hot disk sensor has a radius of 6.403 mm. the shortest distance is about 19 mm, and the probing depth is approximately 10 mm. for this probing depth value, we can consider that we are conducting a bulk measurement. 3.3. test procedures 3.3.1. tests on specimens under saturated and dry conditions firstly, the specimens were immersed by deionized water in a vacuum for a period of 96 h. the specimens were then taken from the vacuum and the water droplets on the surfaces were wiped dry, care being taken

the specimens were saturated with water. subsequently, the hot disk sensor was horizontally placed between the two saturated specimen pieces with the double spiral centered and totally covered, and the two specimen pieces were ﬁrmly clamped together to ensure that there was no air gap between the sensor and the specimen end surfaces, as presented in fig. 4d. in order to remain water saturation, the saturated specimens and the sensor were kept in a plastic bag during thermal conductivity measurement (adl-zarrabi, 2004). after the test, the used water-saturated specimens were suffered from dehydration treatment in a thermostatic drying oven at 105 °c for a period of 24 h and subsequently cooled in a desiccator to measure the thermal conductivity under a dry condition. meanwhile, the mass of the dry specimens (mdry) was measured, and the porosity (n) of the specimens was calculated using the equations n ¼ 100v p v % v p ¼ msat − mdry ρw ð5þ ð6þ where v is the bulk rock volume, vp is the pore volume, and ρw is the density of water. for each pair of specimens saturated or dried, measurements on the thermal conductivity were carried out at room temperature (25 ± 1 °c). 3.3.2. tests on specimens under increasing temperature to investigate the effect of temperature on the thermal conductivity of the tested rocks, measurements were performed on dry specimens from 40 °c to 150 °c based on the requirements of the used test equipment. compared with measurements at room temperature, the experiments under high temperature are time consuming due to a slow stepwise heating process by using a constant temperature oil bath and a temperature control system, as shown in fig. 4c. the thermal conductivity measurement can only be conducted until the two specimen pieces in the chamber with a specimen holder within the oil bath have reached thermal equilibrium and kept a target temperature value. during thermal equilibrium of the oil bath, the hot disk sensor monitors continuously the temperature variation of the specimens. for our tests, the thermal conductivity of the specimens was measured when the recorded temperature variation of the specimens is less than 0.04 °c. in general, 32 h were needed to complete one test. a typical temperature-time history during the test is presented in fig. 6. it should variation of specimen temperature (oc) 0.35 0.30 0.25

each incremental stress level. after each measurement, the load was maintained constant for a period of about 15 min to avoid residual temperature drifts on the specimens. based on the in-situ stress measurement results obtained from the beishan area (zhao et al., 2013), the maximum axial compression stress applied to the specimens was set to be 45 mpa to approximately simulate the excavation-induced stress near the vertical hlw disposal element boundary at a depth of 600 m. the axial stress applied to the specimens was recorded automatically, and the used stress path throughout the course of testing is presented in fig. 7. the experiments were conducted at room temperature. according to previous experimental results (zhao et al., 2015a; zhao et al., 2015b), the identiﬁed crack initiation stresses of cylindrical specimens of beishan granitic rocks under uniaxial compression using the cumulative ae hit (caeh) method range from 45.3 to 109.1 mpa, which are larger than the maximum compression stress adopted in the present study. hence, the stress-induced rock damage might not occur in the tested specimens during loading. it should be mentioned that in the process of loading, the friction may occur at the interfaces between the specimen ends and the sensor. due to limitation of the tps measurement technique, the utilized test method does not consider the potential inﬂuence of interface friction effect on the experimental results. to reduce or eliminate the friction effect, further efforts are needed to produce innovative design for the test equipment. although not perfect, the developed test system provides a feasible means for us to gain insight into thermal conductivity behaviors of rocks under compression. 4. test results 4.1. inﬂuence of water

content of the specimens, leading to difﬁculties in evaluating the relationship between the thermal conductivity and the water saturation degree of the specimens quantitatively. 3.3.3. tests on specimens under uniaxial compression the uniaxial compression tests on dry specimens were conducted using a hydraulic servo-controlled compression machine. for each test, two specimen pieces with the hot disk sensor were contained between steel platens machined to match their end surfaces, as shown in fig. 4b. the interfaces between the specimens and the steel platens were daubed with a thin layer of lubricant to reduce the end effect of the platens during loading. when the experimental setup was completed, axial-load control was used with a loading rate of 100 n/s and the axial load was increased with an increment thermal conductivity measurements were carried out on the 40 pairs of specimens both in dry and water-saturated conditions, and the results are listed in table 2. a statistical analysis shows that for the eight rock groups under dry or saturated state, the standard deviation (sd) and coefﬁcient of variation (cov) of the thermal conductivity are all less than 0.06 w/mk and 4%, respectively, indicating that the results between specimens in each rock group have a good consistency. for all rock groups, the average thermal conductivity values in the dry state (kdry) range between 2.412 and 2.812 w/mk. the values under watersaturated condition (ksat) for the same set of specimens range from 130 x.g. zhao et al. / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137\\x0cx.g.

from table 2 that the tested rocks have an average porosity range from 0.40% to 1.37%. when the dry specimens were saturated with water, water with a higher thermal conductivity (0.604 w/mk) replaced the air with a lower thermal conductivity (0.025 w/mk) in the void of the rocks, leading to an increase of the thermal conductivity. for our data set, the mean thermal conductivity values of the saturated specimens in different rocks groups range from 6.5% to 24.2% higher than those of dry ones. as presented in fig. 8, for the rock groups (i.e., bs06, bs16, bs18-1, bs18-2, bs19-1 and bs19-2) with an average porosity range between 0.40% and 0.52%, the inﬂuence of water saturation on the thermal conductivity of the rocks is relatively small, and ksat increases with increasing kdry in an

seen that the thermal conductivity of the specimens shows a decaying trend with increasing temperature, and the values at 150 °c range from 5.7% to 8.7% lower than those at room temperature. this means that within the used temperature range, the inﬂuence of the increasing temperature on the decay of thermal conductivity for these rocks is limited. on the other hand, a possible reason for the gradual decrease in thermal conductivity is the generation of thermally induced microcracks in the rocks because of a mismatch between thermal expansion coefﬁcients of adjacent mineral grains in a homogeneous temperature ﬁeld (jansen et al., 1993), which has been demonstrated from a microcracking perspective based on numerical simulations (zhao, 2016). based on the experimental data, the relationship between thermal conductivity and temperature can be described using the equation: k ¼ kr − at2 ð8þ where kr is the thermal conductivity of the rock at room temperature (25 °c), t is the temperature in celsius, and a is the ﬁt coefﬁcient (see table 3). the parameter a affects the decaying velocity of the thermal conductivity with the temperature, i.e., the decaying velocity of the thermal conductivity increases as a increases. as shown in table 3, a in eq. (8) varies from rock to rock and can be determined only using laboratory tests. in order to develop a model for predicting a, individual fit overall fit (model) bs15-07 bs18-1-08 bs06-05 bs18-2-05 bs19-1-05 bs05-07 bs16-05 2.9 2.8 2.7 2.6 2.5 2.4 2.3 2.2 thermal conductivity (w/mk) 0 20 40 80 60 100 temperature (oc) 120 140 160 fig. 13. comparison of overall ﬁt using the temperature and rock porosity dependent thermal conductivity model and individual ﬁt of seven pairs of specimens in different rock groups. behavior. however, with further increase of rock porosity, the approximately linear relationship between kdry and ksat is not valid anymore. for example, the rock groups bs05 and bs15 with average porosity values greater than or equal to 0.68% exhibit higher thermal conductivity in the water-saturated state relative to the dry state. to evaluate the thermal conductivity of rocks, various mixing models such as the geometric mean (lichtenecker, 1924), the arithmetic mean (voigt, 1928), the hashin–shtrikman mean (hashin and shtrikman, 1962), and the effective-medium mean (bruggeman, 1935; clauser, 2009) have been proposed. comprehensive overviews and case studies on such mixing models can be found in (abdulagatova et al., 2009; clauser, 2009; fuchs et al., 2013; hartmann, 2005; ray et al., 2015). based on the experimental data (see table 2) in combination with the methodology used by fuchs et al. (2013), the abovementioned mixing models were used to predict the thermal conductivity values of the tested rocks in the water-saturated state. fig. 9 shows the comparison between measured and calculated thermal conductivities for the four different models. it can be observed from fig. 9a, b, and d that the geometric mean, the arithmetic mean, and the effectivemedium mean yield similar prediction results and consistently underestimate the thermal conductivity of the eight rock groups, especially for the groups with relatively high porosity values (e.g., groups bs05 and bs15). the hashin–shtrikman mean shows a reasonably good ﬁt for all rock groups, as shown in fig. 9c. the analysis results are basically in line with observations reported by fuchs et al. (2013) because most of the evaluated mixing models used in their analysis also underestimate the thermal conductivity of the rocks. however, the geometric mean model was rated as the best ﬁt to their data set. it should be noted that the rocks used in their analysis covered different rock types with a large range in porosity, from almost zero to about 30%. in addition, the measured thermal conductivity values of these rocks spans the interval between 1.0 and 6.5 w/mk. the present investigations focused mainly on the granitic rocks with low porosities and a narrow thermal conductivity range. hence, the large difference of rock properties may result in uncertainties between analysis results obtained from various mixing models. more work is required to explain this discrepancy. nagaraju and roy (2014) deﬁned the effect of water saturation on thermal conductivity (s) as a function of porosity of rocks, and s is expressed by s ¼ ksat − kdry ð7þ kdry according to the measurement results listed in table 2, we established the relationship between s and the porosity of the rocks, as presented in fig. 10. analysis of fig. 10 reveals that the effect of water saturation on thermal conductivity of rocks presents an increasing trend with an increase of porosity. a linear form expression can ﬁt the data reasonably well while ensuring that the line passes through the origin. 4.2. inﬂuence of temperature on the thermal conductivity fig. 11 presents the variation of thermal conductivity of seven pairs of dry specimens in different rock groups with temperature from 40 °c table 3 fit coefﬁcient a for thermal conductivity-temperature curves of seven pairs of specimens in different rock groups. rock type and specimen no. monzogranite (bs05-07) granodiorite (bs06-05) monzogranite (bs15-07) granodiorite (bs16-05) monzogranite (bs18-1-08) granodiorite (bs18-2-05) monzogranite (bs19-1-07) a (10−6) 8.821 5.679 8.394 4.871 6.891 5.728 6.385 r2 0.9830 0.9334 0.9853 0.9289 0.9262 0.9581 0.9933 132 x.g. zhao et al. / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137\\x0cx.g. zhao et al. / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137 133 n=2 20 10 axial stress (mpa) 30 40 n=3 20 10 axial stress (mpa) 30 40 50 50 3.4 3.3 3.2 3.1 3.0 2.9 2.8 2.7 2.6 2.5 2.4 c thermal conductivity (w/mk) 50 0 f 2.9 2.8 2.7 2.6 2.5 2.4 thermal conductivity (w/mk) 50 0 n=3 20 10 axial stress (mpa) 30 40 n=3 20 10 axial stress (mpa) 30 40 bs05 bs06 bs15 bs16 bs18-1 bs18-2 bs19-1 bs19-2 y=24.15-24.99e-x (r2=0.9296) 21 18 15 12 0369 i r(%) n=1 20 10 axial stress (mpa) 30 40 50 0.0 0.3 0.9 1.2 0.6 porosity (%) 1.5 1.8 b 3.0 2.9 2.8 2.7 2.6 2.5 2.4 thermal conductivity (w/mk) 50 0 3.2e 3.1 3.0 2.9 2.8 2.7 2.6 2.5 2.4 thermal conductivity (w/mk) 50 0 3.2h 3.1 3.0 2.9 2.8 2.7 2.6 thermal conductivity (w/mk) 50 0 n=3 20 10 axial stress (mpa) 30 40 n=3 20 10 axial stress (mpa) 30 40 n=2 20 10 axial stress (mpa) 30 40 3.0 2.9 2.8 2.7 2.6 2.5 2.4 2.3 2.2 a thermal conductivity (w/mk) 3.0d 2.9 2.8 2.7 2.6 2.5 2.4 2.3 2.2 2.1 2.0 thermal conductivity (w/mk) 3.0g 2.9 2.8 2.7 2.6 2.5 2.4 thermal conductivity (w/mk) 0 0 0 fig. 14. inﬂuence of axial compression stress on the thermal conductivity of the eight rock groups: (a) bs05, (b) bs06, (c) bs15, (d) bs16, (e) bs18-1, (f) bs18-2, (g) bs19-1 and (h) bs19-2, and variation of the increase rate of the thermal conductivity (r) with rock porosity (i). error bars indicate the standard deviation of the thermal conductivity. n in the ﬁgures represents the number of specimen pairs in each rock group. we attempted to relate a with other rock parameters and found that a depended on the magnitude of rock porosity (n), as presented in fig. 12. the coefﬁcient a varies with porosity n according to the following equation: a ¼ 9:43 − 0:71=n2 ð9þ according to eqs.

(11) is not sensitive to the variation of rock porosity, and is within the range from 0.20 to 0.27 except for the rock group bs19-1. for simplicity, an average value of c = 0.24 obtained from table 4 is used to approximately describe the trend, as shown in fig. 15b. using eqs. (11)–(12) and the constant coefﬁcient c, an overall ﬁt is made for these rock groups to reproduce the rock porosity-dependent thermal conductivity under different axial stresses. a comparison between individual and overall ﬁt results is presented in fig. 16. it is found that for each rock group subjected to different compression stresses, the difference of the thermal conductivity values from the individual and overall ﬁts is less than 0.05 w/mk. the good agreement indicates that the established rock porosity-dependent model can capture the nonlinear stress-thermal conductivity relationships of the beishan granitic rocks satisfactorily. 5. discussion one of the ﬁndings from the experimental investigations in the previous sections is that the rock porosity has an inﬂuence on the thermal conductivity of the beishan granitic rocks under water saturation, increasing temperature and compression stress conditions, although the porosity of tested rocks is relatively low. it is well known that for low-porosity crystalline rocks, the mineral composition plays an important role in dominating the thermal conductivity. the crystalline rocks are mainly made up of quartz, feldspars, and maﬁc minerals such as pyroxene, amphibole and biotite, and the content of minerals from these three mineral groups basically determines a rock's thermal conductivity (clauser and huenges, 1995). as mentioned in section 2, a model analysis on a total of 46 thin sections of the rocks was conducted to identify the dominant minerals in the rocks. as listed in table 1, the main minerals of these rocks include quartz, plagioclase, k-feldspar and biotite. among these four minerals, quartz has the highest thermal conductivity (7.69 w/mk) while another three minerals have a thermal conductivity range between 1.70 and 2.29 w/mk (horai, 1971). hence, when the porosity values of the specimens in different rock groups are close to each other, quartz content in the rocks may determine the thermal conductivity. according to the data listed in table 2, fig. 17a presents the inﬂuence of quartz content on the average thermal conductivity of different rock groups in dry state. it is seen that except for rock groups bs05 and bs15 (which have relatively large porosity values of 1.37% and 0.68%, respectively), thermal conductivity of the rocks appears an increasing trend with increasing quartz content. when the specimens are subjected to compression stresses, the original pores and cracks in the rocks tend to close, and the effective contact areas between mineral grains increase, leading to a signiﬁcant decay of the porosity effect on the thermal conductivity, especially for rocks with relatively high porosity. on the other hand, the closure of pores and cracks increases the contact opportunity of quartz grains, and hence improves the transportation capability of heat ﬂow in the rocks. under this condition, an obvious increase of the thermal conductivity for all rock groups with increasing quartz content can be observed, as presented in fig. 17b. 6. conclusions beishan granitic rocks are candidate host rock types for china's hlw repository. in this paper, thermal conductivity characteristics of the beishan granitic rocks have been investigated using the transient plane source (tps) method. the measurement results indicate that for the used eight rock groups with a porosity range from 0.40% to 1.37%, the average thermal conductivity values in the dry state range between 2.412 and 2.812 w/mk. the values under water-saturated condition range from 2.602 to 3.156 w/mk. meanwhile, the effect of water saturation on thermal conductivity presents an increasing trend with an increase of rock porosity. using several mixing models proposed by previous researchers, we found that the hashin–shtrikman mean model showed a reasonably good ﬁt to the experimental data while another three models currently obtained data, a best ﬁtting equation of axial stressdependent thermal conductivity for these rocks can be expressed as (demırcı et al., 2004) k ¼ k0 þ bσ c ð11þ 1 where k0 is the thermal conductivity of the rock at zero stress, σ1 is the axial stress, and b and c are ﬁt coefﬁcients, as listed in table 4. analysis of eq. (11) reveals that the coefﬁcient b plays a critical role in controlling the increasing gradient of the thermal conductivity in the initial loading stage (i.e., crack closure stage). the coefﬁcient c dominantly affects the increasing velocity of the thermal conductivity in the subsequent elastic deformation stage. based on experimental investigations on the thermal conductivity of some rocks subjected to uniaxial stresses using a steady-state apparatus developed by demırcı et al. (2004), görgülü et al. (2008) found that the parameters b and c depended on the magnitude of elastic modulus of the rocks, and subsequently established an elastic modulus dependent model to predict the thermal conductivity values under pressure. unfortunately, in the present study, the elastic moduli of the tested rocks have not been available. therefore, the model proposed by görgülü et al. (2008) cannot be used to ﬁt our test results. according to fig. 14, we found that the increasing gradients of the thermal conductivities in the initial loading stage were generally large for the rocks with a high porosity such as rock groups bs05 and bs15. hence, the coefﬁcient b is associated with the rock porosity n, i.e., b increases as n increases, as presented in fig. 15a. an exponential form expression can ﬁt the data reasonably, as follows: b ¼ 0:25 − 0:24 exp −nð þ ð12þ bs05 bs06 bs15 bs16 bs18-1 bs18-2 bs19-1 bs19-2 20 22 24 26 28 30 32 34 quartz content (%) bs05 bs06 bs15 bs16 bs18-1

inﬂuence of quartz content on the average thermal conductivities of the eight rock groups in dry state (a) and compression state with an axial stress of 45 mpa (b).\\x0c136 x.g. zhao et al. / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137 (i.e., geometric mean, the arithmetic mean, and the effective-medium mean) yielded similar predictions and underestimated the thermal conductivity of the rocks under the water-saturated condition. future work is demanded to verify the validity of various mixing models using different rock types with a large porosity range. with increasing temperature from 25 °c to 150 °c, the thermal conductivity of the rocks shows a decaying trend and the values at 150 °c range from 5.7% to 8.7% lower than those at room temperature, revealing that the inﬂuence of temperature on the thermal conductivity of the tested rocks is limited. in addition, the thermal conductivity of the rocks increases with increasing compression stress in a nonlinear behavior, and the increase rate of the thermal conductivity increases with an increase of rock porosity. it is found that the effects of compression stress and water saturation on the magnitude of thermal conductivity of the rocks are basically comparable. based on the experimental data, the empirical models considering the inﬂuence of rock porosity have been established for predicting the temperature and compression stress dependent thermal conductivity characteristics of the rocks, and the predictions are found to be in good agreement with experimental results. this study thus emphasizes importance of porosity on thermal conductivity measurements even for low porosity crystalline rocks. when the pores and cracks in the rocks tend to close during compression, quartz content may determine the thermal conductivity, and there exists an increase of the thermal conductivity with increasing quartz content. this is because the closure of pores and cracks increases the contact opportunity of quartz grains, and hence improves the transportation capability of heat ﬂow in the rocks. while the test results provide insights into the thermal conductivity characteristics of beishan granitic rocks, one should be aware of the limitation of this study. because the thermal conductivity of granitic rocks is inﬂuenced by many factors. in order to better understand the thermal conductivity of granitic rocks related to rock characteristics such as rock fabric, grain shape, grain contact and grain size, comprehensive petrographic investigations are recommended in the future. in the meantime, studies should be carried out to understand how the interactions between mineral components affect the thermal conductivity. work is also being conducted to investigate the thermal conductivity of the rocks under coupled thermal-hydro-mechanical conditions. acknowledgments this work has been supported by the china atomic energy authority through the geological disposal program and the national natural

wang, 2014). site selection for china's hlw repository started in 1985 (wang, 2010). the efforts have been focused on potential hlw repository sites located within granite intrusions in mainland china. since 1999, the beijing research ⁎ corresponding author. e-mail address: xingguang100@126.com (x.g. zhao). http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tecto.2016.06.021 0040-1951/© 2016 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved. institute of uranium geology (briug) has performed site characterization studies in the beishan area, china. so far, the beishan area has been considered as the most potential candidate area for china's hlw repository. among all the engineering properties of crystalline rocks at a potential hlw repository site, the thermal conductivity is one of the most important parameters in design consideration because it has a direct impact on the evaluation of the necessary repository volume and the optimization of the repository layout (sundberg and hellström, 2009). for instance, in the swedish kbs-3 concept for geological disposal of spent fuel, copper canisters with cast iron inserts containing the spent fuel are surrounded by bentonite for isolation and mechanical protection (, 2006). the heat generated by the spent fuel will increase the temperature of all components of the repository. for the bentonite buffer outside the canisters, the peak temperature must not exceed 100 °c. this requirement implies that the canisters cannot be deposited arbitrarily close to each other. on the other hand, unnecessarily large distances between the canisters will mean inefﬁcient and costly use of the repository rock volume (, 2009). to fulﬁll the temperature requirement, the rocks with low thermal conductivities will\\x0cx.g.  / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137 125 lead to a larger distance between canisters than for a case with high thermal conductivities. this is because the rocks with low thermal conductivities will give rise to higher temperatures in the bentonite (, 2008). hence, to design and construct repositories successfully, it is essential to perform an accurate assessment of the thermal conductivity characteristics of the host rock. over the past few decades, various experimental approaches have been employed to measure the thermal conductivity of rocks. the results indicate that the thermal conductivity of rocks is closely associated with mineral composition, porosity, texture, and density, etc. (birch and clark, 1940; clauser and huenges, 1995; , 2005; , 2004; , 2015; , 2007; , 2009). for crystalline rocks with relatively homogeneous texture and low porosity, the mineral composition dominates the thermal conductivity. in volcanic and sedimentary rocks, the high variability of porosity in these rocks is a major factor controlling the thermal conductivity (clauser and huenges, 1995; , 2004). for example, increasing porosity, which acts as barrier to the ﬂow of heat, often results in both lower p-wave velocity and lower thermal conductivity values (, 2004). for a given rock, water content and temperature have an inﬂuence on its thermal conductivity. generally, the thermal conductivity of the rock increases and decreases with increasing water content (cho and kwon, 2010; , 2009) and temperature (, 2009; birch and clark, 1940; heuze, 1983; , 2014; , 2008; vosteen and schellschmidt, 2003), respectively. moreover, the effect of water saturation on the thermal conductivity of rocks shows a generally increasing trend with increasing porosity (nagaraju and roy, 2014). given that the thermal conductivity of surrounding rocks around the excavations will be changed by the excavation-induced stress, some researchers studied the inﬂuence of pressure on the thermal conductivity of rocks (, 2010; , 2009; , 2004; , 2008; sibbitt, 1976; walsh and decker, 1966; zimmerman, 1989). one of the main ﬁndings achieved from these investigations shows that the thermal conductivity varies with the pressure exerted on the rock. with increasing applied pressure, the thermal conductivity starts to increase and subsequently the increase rate tends to be a constant value due to gradual closure of cracks and pores within the rock (, 2008; walsh and decker, 1966). while the above-mentioned studies provide meaningful insight into the thermal conductivity of various rocks, the thermal conductivity characteristics of low-porosity crystalline rocks subjected to different external factors such as water saturation, temperature and compression stress have not been fully understood. on the other hand, the information on the thermal conductivity of rocks in a potential hlw repository site must be known with sufﬁcient conﬁdence to provide necessary input conditions for its long-term safety assessment, which is one of the motivations for this study. in this work, experimental investigations on the thermal conductivity of the beishan granitic rocks are conducted using the transient plane source (tps) method. in the following discussion, rock sampling and basic physical properties of the rock specimens are introduced ﬁrst. testing facilities and procedures are then described. subsequently, the water saturation, temperature and compression stress dependent thermal conductivity characteristics of the tested rocks are evaluated comprehensively, and ﬁnally some insights are obtained. 2. rock sampling and preparation the beishan area is situated in gansu province of northwestern china (see fig. 1). after a long geological evolution and weathering process, the topography of this area is characterized by a ﬂat gobi and small gentle rolling hills with elevations ranging between 1400 and 2000 m above the sea level. the crust in this area possesses a blocky structure with many granite intrusions (see fig. 2). other surrounding rocks include mainly metamorphic and sedimentary rocks, as well as quaternary cover. rock sampling was carried out in the jijicao and xinchang rock blocks, which are currently considered as two of the key investigation sub-areas during site selection and characterization. fig. 1. geographical location of the beishan area and a photo showing its typical topography.\\x0c126 x.g.  / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137 xinchang bs06 bs18 bs19 jijicao bs16 bs15 bs05 n 2.5 km granitic rock sedimentary rock metamorphic rock quaternary cover borehole fault fig. 2. rock sampling from six boreholes in the jijicao and xinchang sub-areas for thermal conductivity measurements. intact drill cores with a diameter of approximately 63 mm were taken from six sub-vertical boreholes (i.e., boreholes bs05, bs06, bs15, bs16, bs18 and bs19) in these two sub-areas. the borehole locations are presented in fig. 2. field observations indicated that the collected granitic rocks were relatively isotropic in texture and mineralogical composition. to evaluate the geological nature of the rocks, a series of thin sections were prepared and then exposed to cross-polarized light under an optical microscope to identify the dominant minerals in the rocks. the percentages of the dominant minerals were determined by point counting on thin sections. for each thin section approximately 500 points covering phenocrysts and groundmass were counted. according to the quartz-alkali feldspar-plagioclase (qap) diagram (streckeisen, 1976), the rocks can further be classiﬁed. it can be observed from fig. 3 that the rocks contain mainly a moderate to low amount of quartz and alkali feldspar, and a moderate to high amount of plagioclase. this means that the collected rocks dominantly range from granodiorite to monzogranite. for grain size characteristics, the rocks are from ﬁne grained to, medium to coarse grained. an overview of the basic information of the rocks is listed in table 1. based on the borehole no. and sampling depth, these rocks have been divided into eight groups. a total of 47 pairs of rock specimens, 50 mm in diameter, were prepared from the drill cores with a length to diameter ratio of approximately 0.5. in particular, specimen ends were polished carefully using a q 90 90 i - granodiorite ii - monzogranite 60 60 ii i bs05 bs06 bs15 bs16 bs18-1 bs18-2 bs19-1 bs19-2 20 20 5 5 p 10 35 65 90 a fig. 3. qap classiﬁcation of the eight rock groups based on modal analysis. grinding machine until the ﬂatness and roughness of the ends are less than 10 μm and 3 μm, respectively. the ﬂat and polished specimen end surfaces minimize the thermal contact resistance during thermal conductivity measurement. a minimum of ten specimens for each rock group were prepared. 3. test methodology 3.1. an introduction to the used tps method in the ﬁelds of geology and geophysics, laboratory approaches to measuring soil and rock thermal conductivity can mainly be divided into two groups: steady state and transient state. in this work, the transient plane source (tps) method (gustafsson, 1991; log and gustafsson, 1995) was utilized to measure the thermal conductivity of the specimens. as one of the transient measurement methods, the tps technique is based on the use of a transiently heated plane sensor (i.e., hot disk sensor) and a hot disk thermal constants analyser (see fig. 4a). the used hot disk tps2500s system can measure thermal conductivity of materials ranging from 0.01 to 400 w/mk. the hot disk sensor consists of a continuous double spiral, which is etched out of a thin nickel foil (fig. 4e). this spiral is sandwiched between two sheets of electrical insulation materials made of kapton. the sensor acts both as a heat source for increasing the temperature of the specimens and as a dynamic temperature sensor for recording the temperature increase. during the measurement, the temperature in the sensor rises and heat starts to ﬂow to the specimens. the temperature rise in the sensor provides an indicator of the thermal properties of the specimens. if the specimens have good thermal conducting properties, the heat will be transported rapidly inside the specimens. on the contrary, if the specimens have good thermal insulation properties, the sensor temperature will rise faster and the heat will not be transported as much as in the test of the good thermal conducting specimens. compared with steady state measurement methods such as the divided bar (beck and beck, 1958; birch, 1950; , 1971) and the guarded hot plate (, 2009; , 2012), one of significant advantages of the tps technique is that the thermal conductivity of materials can be measured more quickly, typically from several to tens of seconds. hence, a long wait for thermal gradients to equilibrate is not required and the moisture migration in response to temperature gradients was minimized (jackson and taylor, 1986). on the other hand, unlike some transient methods such as thermal needle probes (barry-, 2013; von herzen and maxwell, 1959), which are commonly used for soils and soft rocks, the tps method can be\\x0cx.g.  / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137 127 table 1 basic information and geological description of the tested rocks. rock type and group basic information mineral composition naked eye observation photomicrograph of a thin section monzogranite (bs05) location: jijicao borehole no.: bs05 sampling depth: 5–7 m number of specimen pairs: 7 grain size: medium plagioclase: 33.7% ± 5.8%;

, 2003). hence, the thermal resistance between the specimen ends and the sensor exists (see section 3.2). so far, the tps technology has been widely used to\\x0c128 x.g.  / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137 a c temperature control system b hot disk thermal constants analyser sensor platen specimens d e specimens insulation material chamber sensor specimens oil bath sensor double spiral cable extension fig. 4. the hot disk tps2500s system (a) used to measure the thermal conductivity of specimens under room temperature (d), high temperature (c), and uniaxial compression (b) conditions. a hot disk sensor showing its key components (e). determine the thermal properties of different materials (, 2015; , 2008; urquhart and bauer, 2015; , 2014; , 2012). 3.2. theory of the tps technique to theoretically describe how the tps method behaves, the thermal conductivity equation can be solved assuming that the hot disk sensor consists of a certain number of concentric ring heat sources located in an inﬁnitely large sample (hot disk, 2007). a constant electric power supplied to the sensor results in an increase in temperature which is directly related to the variation in the sensor resistance (r(t)) by the equation: \\x10 \\x11 r tð þ ¼ r0 1 þ αδt τð þ ð1þ where r0 is the nickel electrical resistance in the beginning of the recording, α is the temperature coefﬁcient of resistance of the nickel foil, and δtðτþ is the mean value of temperature rise in the sensor due to a constant current pulse given by: \\x10 δt τð þ ¼ p0 π3=2ak \\x11−1d τð þ ð2þ where p0 is the total output of power from the sensor, a is the sensor radius, k is the thermal conductivity of the sample that is being tested and d(τ) is a dimensionless time dependent function with: τ ¼ t=θð ð3þ þ1=2; θ ¼ a2=d where t is the time measured from the start of the transient recording, θ is the characteristic time, which depends both on parameters of the sensor and the sample, and d is the thermal diffusivity of the sample. according to eq. (2), and δtðτþ and d(τ) plotted as a function of τ provides a linear relationship with a slope that is a function of p0, a, and k. thermal conductivity k can be obtained by ﬁtting the experimental data to the straight line given by eq. (2); thermal diffusivity d is calculated from eq. (3) taking into account the τ value determined in the previous ﬁt. as mentioned above, the solution of the thermal conductivity equation is based on the assumption that the hot disk sensor is located in an inﬁnite material in perfect contact with the sensor surface. this means that the heat ﬂow generated from each measurement must not reach the outside boundaries of the specimen (hot disk, 2007). meanwhile, a careful preparation of specimen ends is required to minimize thermal contact resistance. an estimation of how far the heat ﬂow has proceeded in the specimen during a recording is the probing depth δp, which is deﬁned as (hot disk, 2007): ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ p dt δp ¼ 2 ð4þ to determine the thermal conductivity with good accuracy, the shortest distance from any part of the sensor to the nearest outside boundary of the sample should be larger than δp. in our experiments, the used hot disk sensor has a radius of 6.403 mm. the shortest distance is about 19 mm, and the probing depth is approximately 10 mm. for this probing depth value, we can consider that we are conducting a bulk measurement. 3.3. test procedures 3.3.1. tests on specimens under saturated and dry conditions firstly, the specimens were immersed by deionized water in a vacuum for a period of 96 h. the specimens were then taken from the vacuum and the water droplets on the surfaces were wiped dry, care being taken to ensure that no rock grains or fragments were lost. the mass of the water-saturated specimens (msat) was measured using a\\x0cx.g.  / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137 129 loading measurement 60 50

specimens were saturated with water. subsequently, the hot disk sensor was horizontally placed between the two saturated specimen pieces with the double spiral centered and totally covered, and the two specimen pieces were ﬁrmly clamped together to ensure that there was no air gap between the sensor and the specimen end surfaces, as presented in fig. 4d. in order to remain water saturation, the saturated specimens and the sensor were kept in a plastic bag during thermal conductivity measurement (adl-zarrabi, 2004). after the test, the used water-saturated specimens were suffered from dehydration treatment in a thermostatic drying oven at 105 °c for a period of 24 h and subsequently cooled in a desiccator to measure the thermal conductivity under a dry condition. meanwhile, the mass of the dry specimens (mdry) was measured, and the porosity (n) of the specimens was calculated using the equations n ¼ 100v p v % v p ¼ msat − mdry ρw ð5þ ð6þ where v is the bulk rock volume, vp is the pore volume, and ρw is the density of water. for each pair of specimens saturated or dried, measurements on the thermal conductivity were carried out at room temperature (25 ± 1 °c). 3.3.2. tests on specimens under increasing temperature to investigate the effect of temperature on the thermal conductivity of the tested rocks, measurements were performed on dry specimens from 40 °c to 150 °c based on the requirements of the used test equipment. compared with measurements at room temperature, the experiments under high temperature are time consuming due to a slow stepwise heating process by using a constant temperature oil bath and a temperature control system, as shown in fig. 4c. the thermal conductivity measurement can only be conducted until the two specimen pieces in the chamber with a specimen holder within the oil bath have reached thermal equilibrium and kept a target temperature value. during thermal equilibrium of the oil bath, the hot disk sensor monitors continuously the temperature variation of the specimens. for our tests, the thermal conductivity of the specimens was measured when the recorded temperature variation of the specimens is less than 0.04 °c. in general, 32 h were needed to complete one test. a typical temperature-time history during the test is presented in fig. 6. it should variation of specimen temperature (oc) 0.35 0.30 0.25

each incremental stress level. after each measurement, the load was maintained constant for a period of about 15 min to avoid residual temperature drifts on the specimens. based on the in-situ stress measurement results obtained from the beishan area (, 2013), the maximum axial compression stress applied to the specimens was set to be 45 mpa to approximately simulate the excavation-induced stress near the vertical hlw disposal element boundary at a depth of 600 m. the axial stress applied to the specimens was recorded automatically, and the used stress path throughout the course of testing is presented in fig. 7. the experiments were conducted at room temperature. according to previous experimental results (, 2015a; , 2015b), the identiﬁed crack initiation stresses of cylindrical specimens of beishan granitic rocks under uniaxial compression using the cumulative ae hit (caeh) method range from 45.3 to 109.1 mpa, which are larger than the maximum compression stress adopted in the present study. hence, the stress-induced rock damage might not occur in the tested specimens during loading. it should be mentioned that in the process of loading, the friction may occur at the interfaces between the specimen ends and the sensor. due to limitation of the tps measurement technique, the utilized test method does not consider the potential inﬂuence of interface friction effect on the

water-saturated specimens were not adopted in this test because little was known about how the gradual heating and the thermal equilibrium processes would affect the water content of the specimens, leading to difﬁculties in evaluating the relationship between the thermal conductivity and the water saturation degree of the specimens quantitatively. 3.3.3. tests on specimens under uniaxial compression the uniaxial compression tests on dry specimens were conducted using a hydraulic servo-controlled compression machine. for each test, two specimen pieces with the hot disk sensor were contained between steel platens machined to match their end surfaces, as shown in fig. 4b. the interfaces between the specimens and the steel platens were daubed with a thin layer of lubricant to reduce the end effect of the platens during loading. when the experimental setup was completed, axial-load control was used with a loading rate of 100 n/s and the axial load was increased with an increment thermal conductivity measurements were carried out on the 40 pairs of specimens both in dry and water-saturated conditions, and the results are listed in table 2. a statistical analysis shows that for the eight rock groups under dry or saturated state, the standard deviation (sd) and coefﬁcient of variation (cov) of the thermal conductivity are all less than 0.06 w/mk and 4%, respectively, indicating that the results between specimens in each rock group have a good consistency. for all rock groups, the average thermal conductivity values in the dry state (kdry) range between 2.412 and 2.812 w/mk. the values under watersaturated condition (ksat) for the same set of specimens range from 130 x.g.  / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137\\x0cx.g.  / tectonophysics 683

tested rocks have an average porosity range from 0.40% to 1.37%. when the dry specimens were saturated with water, water with a higher thermal conductivity (0.604 w/mk) replaced the air with a lower thermal conductivity (0.025 w/mk) in the void of the rocks, leading to an increase of the thermal conductivity. for our data set, the mean thermal conductivity values of the saturated specimens in different rocks groups range from 6.5% to 24.2% higher than those of dry ones. as presented in fig. 8, for the rock groups (i.e., bs06, bs16, bs18-1, bs18-2, bs19-1 and bs19-2) with an average porosity range between 0.40% and 0.52%, the inﬂuence of water saturation on the thermal conductivity of the rocks is relatively small, and ksat increases with increasing kdry in an approximately

conductivity of the specimens shows a decaying trend with increasing temperature, and the values at 150 °c range from 5.7% to 8.7% lower than those at room temperature. this means that within the used temperature range, the inﬂuence of the increasing temperature on the decay of thermal conductivity for these rocks is limited. on the other hand, a possible reason for the gradual decrease in thermal conductivity is the generation of thermally induced microcracks in the rocks because of a mismatch between thermal expansion coefﬁcients of adjacent mineral grains in a homogeneous temperature ﬁeld (, 1993), which has been demonstrated from a microcracking perspective based on numerical simulations (zhao, 2016). based on the experimental data, the relationship between thermal conductivity and temperature can be described using the equation: k ¼ kr − at2 ð8þ where kr is the thermal conductivity of the rock at room temperature (25 °c), t is the temperature in celsius, and a is the ﬁt coefﬁcient (see table 3). the parameter a affects the decaying velocity of the thermal conductivity with the temperature, i.e., the decaying velocity of the thermal conductivity increases as a increases. as shown in table 3, a in eq. (8) varies from rock to rock and can be determined only using laboratory tests. in order to develop a model for predicting a, individual fit overall fit (model) bs15-07 bs18-1-08 bs06-05 bs18-2-05 bs19-1-05 bs05-07 bs16-05 2.9 2.8 2.7 2.6 2.5 2.4 2.3 2.2 thermal conductivity (w/mk) 0 20 40 80 60 100 temperature (oc) 120 140 160 fig. 13. comparison of overall ﬁt using the temperature and rock porosity dependent thermal conductivity model and individual ﬁt of seven pairs of specimens in different rock groups. behavior. however, with further increase of rock porosity, the approximately linear relationship between kdry and ksat is not valid anymore. for example, the rock groups bs05 and bs15 with average porosity values greater than or equal to 0.68% exhibit higher thermal conductivity in the water-saturated state relative to the dry state. to evaluate the thermal conductivity of rocks, various mixing models such as the geometric mean (lichtenecker, 1924), the arithmetic mean (voigt, 1928), the hashin–shtrikman mean (hashin and shtrikman, 1962), and the effective-medium mean (bruggeman, 1935; clauser, 2009) have been proposed. comprehensive overviews and case studies on such mixing models can be found in (, 2009; clauser, 2009; , 2013; hartmann, 2005; , 2015). based on the experimental data (see table 2) in combination with the methodology used by  (2013), the abovementioned mixing models were used to predict the thermal conductivity values of the tested rocks in the water-saturated state. fig. 9 shows the comparison between measured and calculated thermal conductivities for the four different models. it can be observed from fig. 9a, b, and d that the geometric mean, the arithmetic mean, and the effectivemedium mean yield similar prediction results and consistently underestimate the thermal conductivity of the eight rock groups, especially for the groups with relatively high porosity values (e.g., groups bs05 and bs15). the hashin–shtrikman mean shows a reasonably good ﬁt for all rock groups, as shown in fig. 9c. the analysis results are basically in line with observations reported by  (2013) because most of the evaluated mixing models used in their analysis also underestimate the thermal conductivity of the rocks. however, the geometric mean model was rated as the best ﬁt to their data set. it should be noted that the rocks used in their analysis covered different rock types with a large range in porosity, from almost zero to about 30%. in addition, the measured thermal conductivity values of these rocks spans the interval between 1.0 and 6.5 w/mk. the present investigations focused mainly on the granitic rocks with low porosities and a narrow thermal conductivity range. hence, the large difference of rock properties may result in uncertainties between analysis results obtained from various mixing models. more work is required to explain this discrepancy. nagaraju and roy (2014) deﬁned the effect of water saturation on thermal conductivity (s) as a function of porosity of rocks, and s is expressed by s ¼ ksat − kdry ð7þ kdry according to the measurement results listed in table 2, we established the relationship between s and the porosity of the rocks, as presented in fig. 10. analysis of fig. 10 reveals that the effect of water saturation on thermal conductivity of rocks presents an increasing trend with an increase of porosity. a linear form expression can ﬁt the data reasonably well while ensuring that the line passes through the origin. 4.2. inﬂuence of temperature on the thermal conductivity fig. 11 presents the variation of thermal conductivity of seven pairs of dry specimens in different rock groups with temperature from 40 °c table 3 fit coefﬁcient a for thermal conductivity-temperature curves of seven pairs of specimens in different rock groups. rock type and specimen no. monzogranite (bs05-07) granodiorite (bs06-05) monzogranite (bs15-07) granodiorite (bs16-05) monzogranite (bs18-1-08) granodiorite (bs18-2-05) monzogranite (bs19-1-07) a (10−6) 8.821 5.679 8.394 4.871 6.891 5.728 6.385 r2 0.9830 0.9334 0.9853 0.9289 0.9262 0.9581 0.9933 132 x.g.  / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137\\x0cx.g.  / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137 133 n=2 20 10 axial stress (mpa) 30 40 n=3 20 10 axial stress (mpa) 30 40 50 50 3.4 3.3 3.2 3.1 3.0 2.9 2.8 2.7 2.6 2.5 2.4 c thermal conductivity (w/mk) 50 0 f 2.9 2.8 2.7 2.6 2.5 2.4 thermal conductivity (w/mk) 50 0 n=3 20 10 axial stress (mpa) 30 40 n=3 20 10 axial stress (mpa) 30 40 bs05 bs06 bs15 bs16 bs18-1 bs18-2 bs19-1 bs19-2 y=24.15-24.99e-x (r2=0.9296) 21 18 15 12 0369 i r(%) n=1 20 10 axial stress (mpa) 30 40 50 0.0 0.3 0.9 1.2 0.6 porosity (%) 1.5 1.8 b 3.0 2.9 2.8 2.7 2.6 2.5 2.4 thermal conductivity (w/mk) 50 0 3.2e 3.1 3.0 2.9 2.8 2.7 2.6 2.5 2.4 thermal conductivity (w/mk) 50 0 3.2h 3.1 3.0 2.9 2.8 2.7 2.6 thermal conductivity (w/mk) 50 0 n=3 20 10 axial stress (mpa) 30 40 n=3 20 10 axial stress (mpa) 30 40 n=2 20 10 axial stress (mpa) 30 40 3.0 2.9 2.8 2.7 2.6 2.5 2.4 2.3 2.2 a thermal conductivity (w/mk) 3.0d 2.9 2.8 2.7 2.6 2.5 2.4 2.3 2.2 2.1 2.0 thermal conductivity (w/mk) 3.0g 2.9 2.8 2.7 2.6 2.5 2.4 thermal conductivity (w/mk) 0 0 0 fig. 14. inﬂuence of axial compression stress on the thermal conductivity of the eight rock groups: (a) bs05, (b) bs06, (c) bs15, (d) bs16, (e) bs18-1, (f) bs18-2, (g) bs19-1 and (h) bs19-2, and variation of the increase rate of the thermal conductivity (r) with rock porosity (i). error bars indicate the standard deviation of the thermal conductivity. n in the ﬁgures represents the number of specimen pairs in each rock group. we attempted to relate a with other rock parameters and found that a depended on the magnitude of rock porosity (n), as presented in fig. 12. the coefﬁcient a varies with porosity n according to the following equation: a ¼ 9:43 − 0:71=n2 ð9þ according to eqs.

(11)–(12) and the constant coefﬁcient c, an overall ﬁt is made for these rock groups to reproduce the rock porosity-dependent thermal conductivity under different axial stresses. a comparison between individual and overall ﬁt results is presented in fig. 16. it is found that for each rock group subjected to different compression stresses, the difference of the thermal conductivity values from the individual and overall ﬁts is less than 0.05 w/mk. the good agreement indicates that the established rock porosity-dependent model can capture the nonlinear stress-thermal conductivity relationships of the beishan granitic rocks satisfactorily. 5. discussion one of the ﬁndings from the experimental investigations in the previous sections is that the rock porosity has an inﬂuence on the thermal conductivity of the beishan granitic rocks under water saturation, increasing temperature and compression stress conditions, although the porosity of tested rocks is relatively low. it is well known that for low-porosity crystalline rocks, the mineral composition plays an important role in dominating the thermal conductivity. the crystalline rocks are mainly made up of quartz, feldspars, and maﬁc minerals such as pyroxene, amphibole and biotite, and the content of minerals from these three mineral groups basically determines a rock's thermal conductivity (clauser and huenges, 1995). as mentioned in section 2, a model analysis on a total of 46 thin sections of the rocks was conducted to identify the dominant minerals in the rocks. as listed in table 1, the main minerals of these rocks include quartz, plagioclase, k-feldspar and biotite. among these four minerals, quartz has the highest thermal conductivity (7.69 w/mk) while another three minerals have a thermal conductivity range between 1.70 and 2.29 w/mk (horai, 1971). hence, when the porosity values of the specimens in different rock groups are close to each other, quartz content in the rocks may determine the thermal conductivity. according to the data listed in table 2, fig. 17a presents the inﬂuence of quartz content on the average thermal conductivity of different rock groups in dry state. it is seen that except for rock groups bs05 and bs15 (which have relatively large porosity values of 1.37% and 0.68%, respectively), thermal conductivity of the rocks appears an increasing trend with increasing quartz content. when the specimens are subjected to compression stresses, the original pores and cracks in the rocks tend to close, and the effective contact areas between mineral grains increase, leading to a signiﬁcant decay of the porosity effect on the thermal conductivity, especially for rocks with relatively high porosity. on the other hand, the closure of pores and cracks increases the contact opportunity of quartz grains, and hence improves the transportation capability of heat ﬂow in the rocks. under this condition, an obvious increase of the thermal conductivity for all rock groups with increasing quartz content can be observed, as presented in fig. 17b. 6. conclusions beishan granitic rocks are candidate host rock types for china's hlw repository. in this paper, thermal conductivity characteristics of the beishan granitic rocks have been investigated using the transient plane source (tps) method. the measurement results indicate that for the used eight rock groups with a porosity range from 0.40% to 1.37%, the average thermal conductivity values in the dry state range between 2.412 and 2.812 w/mk. the values under water-saturated condition range from 2.602 to 3.156 w/mk. meanwhile, the effect of water saturation on thermal conductivity presents an increasing trend with an increase of rock porosity. using several mixing models proposed by previous researchers, we found that the hashin–shtrikman mean model showed a reasonably good ﬁt to the experimental data while another three models currently obtained data, a best ﬁtting equation of axial stressdependent thermal conductivity for these rocks can be expressed as (, 2004) k ¼ k0 þ bσ c ð11þ 1 where k0 is the thermal conductivity of the rock at zero stress, σ1 is the axial stress, and b and c are ﬁt coefﬁcients, as listed in table 4. analysis of eq. (11) reveals that the coefﬁcient b plays a critical role in controlling the increasing gradient of the thermal conductivity in the initial loading stage (i.e., crack closure stage). the coefﬁcient c dominantly affects the increasing velocity of the thermal conductivity in the subsequent elastic deformation stage. based on experimental investigations on the thermal conductivity of some rocks subjected to uniaxial stresses using a steady-state apparatus developed by  (2004),  (2008) found that the parameters b and c depended on the magnitude of elastic modulus of the rocks, and subsequently established an elastic modulus dependent model to predict the thermal conductivity values under pressure. unfortunately, in the present study, the elastic moduli of the tested rocks have not been available. therefore, the model proposed by  (2008) cannot be used to ﬁt our test results. according to fig. 14, we found that the increasing gradients of the thermal conductivities in the initial loading stage were generally large for the rocks with a high porosity such as rock groups bs05 and bs15. hence, the coefﬁcient b is associated with the rock porosity n, i.e., b increases as n increases, as presented in fig. 15a. an exponential form expression can ﬁt the data reasonably, as follows: b ¼ 0:25 − 0:24 exp −nð þ ð12þ bs05 bs06 bs15 bs16 bs18-1 bs18-2 bs19-1 bs19-2 20 22 24 26

the thermal conductivity of the rocks under the water-saturated condition. future work is demanded to verify the validity of various mixing models using different rock types with a large porosity range. with increasing temperature from 25 °c to 150 °c, the thermal conductivity of the rocks shows a decaying trend and the values at 150 °c range from 5.7% to 8.7% lower than those at room temperature, revealing that the inﬂuence of temperature on the thermal conductivity of the tested rocks is limited. in addition, the thermal conductivity of the rocks increases with increasing compression stress in a nonlinear behavior, and the increase rate of the thermal conductivity increases with an increase of rock porosity. it is found that the effects of compression stress and water saturation on the magnitude of thermal conductivity of the rocks are basically comparable. based on the experimental data, the empirical models considering the inﬂuence of rock porosity have been established for predicting the temperature and compression stress dependent thermal conductivity characteristics of the rocks, and the predictions are found to be in good agreement with experimental results. this study thus emphasizes importance of porosity on thermal conductivity measurements even for low porosity crystalline rocks. when the pores and cracks in the rocks tend to close during compression, quartz content may determine the thermal conductivity, and there exists an increase of the thermal conductivity with increasing quartz content. this is because the closure of pores and cracks increases the contact opportunity of quartz grains, and hence improves the transportation capability of heat ﬂow in the rocks. while the test results provide insights into the thermal conductivity characteristics of beishan granitic rocks, one should be aware of the limitation of this study. because the thermal conductivity of granitic rocks is inﬂuenced by many factors. in order to better understand the thermal conductivity of granitic rocks related to rock characteristics such as rock fabric, grain shape, grain contact and grain size, comprehensive petrographic investigations are recommended in the future. in the meantime, studies should be carried out to understand how the interactions between mineral components affect the thermal conductivity. work is also being conducted to investigate the thermal conductivity of the rocks under coupled thermal-hydro-mechanical conditions. acknowledgments this work has been supported by the china atomic energy

wang, 2014). site selection for china's hlw repository started in 1985 (wang, 2010). the efforts have been focused on potential hlw repository sites located within granite intrusions in mainland china. since 1999, the beijing research ⁎ corresponding author. e-mail address: xingguang100@126.com (x.g. zhao). http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tecto.2016.06.021 0040-1951/© 2016 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved. institute of uranium geology (briug) has performed site characterization studies in the beishan area, china. so far, the beishan area has been considered as the most potential candidate area for china's hlw repository. among all the engineering properties of crystalline rocks at a potential hlw repository site, the thermal conductivity is one of the most important parameters in design consideration because it has a direct impact on the evaluation of the necessary repository volume and the optimization of the repository layout (sundberg and hellström, 2009). for instance, in the swedish kbs-3 concept for geological disposal of spent fuel, copper canisters with cast iron inserts containing the spent fuel are surrounded by bentonite for isolation and mechanical protection (, 2006). the heat generated by the spent fuel will increase the temperature of all components of the repository. for the bentonite buffer outside the canisters, the peak temperature must not exceed 100 °c. this requirement implies that the canisters cannot be deposited arbitrarily close to each other. on the other hand, unnecessarily large distances between the canisters will mean inefﬁcient and costly use of the repository rock volume (, 2009). to fulﬁll the temperature requirement, the rocks with low thermal conductivities will\\x0cx.g.  / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137 125 lead to a larger distance between canisters than for a case with high thermal conductivities. this is because the rocks with low thermal conductivities will give rise to higher temperatures in the bentonite (, 2008). hence, to design and construct repositories successfully, it is essential to perform an accurate assessment of the thermal conductivity characteristics of the host rock. over the past few decades, various experimental approaches have been employed to measure the thermal conductivity of rocks. the results indicate that the thermal conductivity of rocks is closely associated with mineral composition, porosity, texture, and density, etc. (birch and clark, 1940; clauser and huenges, 1995; , 2005; , 2004; , 2015; , 2007; , 2009). for crystalline rocks with relatively homogeneous texture and low porosity, the mineral composition dominates the thermal conductivity. in volcanic and sedimentary rocks, the high variability of porosity in these rocks is a major factor controlling the thermal conductivity (clauser and huenges, 1995; , 2004). for example, increasing porosity, which acts as barrier to the ﬂow of heat, often results in both lower p-wave velocity and lower thermal conductivity values (, 2004). for a given rock, water content and temperature have an inﬂuence on its thermal conductivity. generally, the thermal conductivity of the rock increases and decreases with increasing water content (cho and kwon, 2010; , 2009) and temperature (, 2009; birch and clark, 1940; heuze, 1983; , 2014; , 2008; vosteen and schellschmidt, 2003), respectively. moreover, the effect of water saturation on the thermal conductivity of rocks shows a generally increasing trend with increasing porosity (nagaraju and roy, 2014). given that the thermal conductivity of surrounding rocks around the excavations will be changed by the excavation-induced stress, some researchers studied the inﬂuence of pressure on the thermal conductivity of rocks (, 2010; , 2009; , 2004; , 2008; sibbitt, 1976; walsh and decker, 1966; zimmerman, 1989). one of the main ﬁndings achieved from these investigations shows that the thermal conductivity varies with the pressure exerted on the rock. with increasing applied pressure, the thermal conductivity starts to increase and subsequently the increase rate tends to be a constant value due to gradual closure of cracks and pores within the rock (, 2008; walsh and decker, 1966). while the above-mentioned studies provide meaningful insight into the thermal conductivity of various rocks, the thermal conductivity characteristics of low-porosity crystalline rocks subjected to different external factors such as water saturation, temperature and compression stress have not been fully understood. on the other hand, the information on the thermal conductivity of rocks in a potential hlw repository site must be known with sufﬁcient conﬁdence to provide necessary input conditions for its long-term safety assessment, which is one of the motivations for this study. in this work, experimental investigations on the thermal conductivity of the beishan granitic rocks are conducted using the transient plane source (tps) method. in the following discussion, rock sampling and basic physical properties of the rock specimens are introduced ﬁrst. testing facilities and procedures are then described. subsequently, the water saturation, temperature and compression stress dependent thermal conductivity characteristics of the tested rocks are evaluated comprehensively, and ﬁnally some insights are obtained. 2. rock sampling and preparation the beishan area is situated in gansu province of northwestern china (see ). after a long geological evolution and weathering process, the topography of this area is characterized by a ﬂat gobi and small gentle rolling hills with elevations ranging between 1400 and 2000 m above the sea level. the crust in this area possesses a blocky structure with many granite intrusions (see ). other surrounding rocks include mainly metamorphic and sedimentary rocks, as well as quaternary cover. rock sampling was carried out in the jijicao and xinchang rock blocks, which are currently considered as two of the key investigation sub-areas during site selection and characterization. . geographical location of the beishan area and a photo showing its typical topography.\\x0c126 x.g.  / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137 xinchang bs06 bs18 bs19 jijicao bs16 bs15 bs05 n 2.5 km granitic rock sedimentary rock metamorphic rock quaternary cover borehole fault . rock sampling from six boreholes in the jijicao and xinchang sub-areas for thermal conductivity measurements. intact drill cores with a diameter of approximately 63 mm were taken from six sub-vertical boreholes (i.e., boreholes bs05, bs06, bs15, bs16, bs18 and bs19) in these two sub-areas. the borehole locations are presented in . field observations indicated that the collected granitic rocks were relatively isotropic in texture and mineralogical composition. to evaluate the geological nature of the rocks, a series of thin sections were prepared and then exposed to cross-polarized light under an optical microscope to identify the dominant minerals in the rocks. the percentages of the dominant minerals were determined by point counting on thin sections. for each thin section approximately 500 points covering phenocrysts and groundmass were counted. according to the quartz-alkali feldspar-plagioclase (qap) diagram (streckeisen, 1976), the rocks can further be classiﬁed. it can be observed from  that the rocks contain mainly a moderate to low amount of quartz and alkali feldspar, and a moderate to high amount of plagioclase. this means that the collected rocks dominantly range from granodiorite to monzogranite. for grain size characteristics, the rocks are from ﬁne grained to, medium to coarse grained. an overview of the basic information of the rocks is listed in . based on the borehole no. and sampling depth, these rocks have been divided into eight groups. a total of 47 pairs of rock specimens, 50 mm in diameter, were prepared from the drill cores with a length to diameter ratio of approximately 0.5. in particular, specimen ends were polished carefully using a q 90 90 i - granodiorite ii - monzogranite 60 60 ii i bs05 bs06 bs15 bs16 bs18-1 bs18-2 bs19-1 bs19-2 20 20 5 5 p 10 35 65 90 a . qap classiﬁcation of the eight rock groups based on modal analysis. grinding machine until the ﬂatness and roughness of the ends are less than 10 μm and 3 μm, respectively. the ﬂat and polished specimen end surfaces minimize the thermal contact resistance during thermal conductivity measurement. a minimum of ten specimens for each rock group were prepared. 3. test methodology 3.1. an introduction to the used tps method in the ﬁelds of geology and geophysics, laboratory approaches to measuring soil and rock thermal conductivity can mainly be divided into two groups: steady state and transient state. in this work, the transient plane source (tps) method (gustafsson, 1991; log and gustafsson, 1995) was utilized to measure the thermal conductivity of the specimens. as one of the transient measurement methods, the tps technique is based on the use of a transiently heated plane sensor (i.e., hot disk sensor) and a hot disk thermal constants analyser (see a). the used hot disk tps2500s system can measure thermal conductivity of materials ranging from 0.01 to 400 w/mk. the hot disk sensor consists of a continuous double spiral, which is etched out of a thin nickel foil (e). this spiral is sandwiched between two sheets of electrical insulation materials made of kapton. the sensor acts both as a heat source for increasing the temperature of the specimens and as a dynamic temperature sensor for recording the temperature increase. during the measurement, the temperature in the sensor rises and heat starts to ﬂow to the specimens. the temperature rise in the sensor provides an indicator of the thermal properties of the specimens. if the specimens have good thermal conducting properties, the heat will be transported rapidly inside the specimens. on the contrary, if the specimens have good thermal insulation properties, the sensor temperature will rise faster and the heat will not be transported as much as in the test of the good thermal conducting specimens. compared with steady state measurement methods such as the divided bar (beck and beck, 1958; birch, 1950; , 1971) and the guarded hot plate (, 2009; , 2012), one of significant advantages of the tps technique is that the thermal conductivity of materials can be measured more quickly, typically from several to tens of seconds. hence, a long wait for thermal gradients to equilibrate is not required and the moisture migration in response to temperature gradients was minimized (jackson and taylor, 1986). on the other hand, unlike some transient methods such as thermal needle probes (barry-, 2013; von herzen and maxwell, 1959), which are commonly used for soils and soft rocks, the tps method can be\\x0cx.g.  / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137 127  basic information and geological description of the tested rocks. rock type and group basic information mineral composition naked eye observation photomicrograph of a thin section monzogranite (bs05) location: jijicao borehole no.: bs05 sampling depth: 5–7 m number of specimen pairs: 7 grain size: medium plagioclase: 33.7% ± 5.8%;

, 2003). hence, the thermal resistance between the specimen ends and the sensor exists (see section 3.2). so far, the tps technology has been widely used to\\x0c128 x.g.  / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137 a c temperature control system b hot disk thermal constants analyser sensor platen specimens d e specimens insulation material chamber sensor specimens oil bath sensor double spiral cable extension . the hot disk tps2500s system (a) used to measure the thermal conductivity of specimens under room temperature (d), high temperature (c), and uniaxial compression (b) conditions. a hot disk sensor showing its key components (e). determine the thermal properties of different materials (, 2015; , 2008; urquhart and bauer, 2015; , 2014; , 2012). 3.2. theory of the tps technique to theoretically describe how the tps method behaves, the thermal conductivity equation can be solved assuming that the hot disk sensor consists of a certain number of concentric ring heat sources located in an inﬁnitely large sample (hot disk, 2007). a constant electric power supplied to the sensor results in an increase in temperature which is directly related to the variation in the sensor resistance (r(t)) by the equation: \\x10 \\x11 r tð þ ¼ r0 1 þ αδt τð þ ð1þ where r0 is the nickel electrical resistance in the beginning of the recording, α is the temperature coefﬁcient of resistance of the nickel foil, and δtðτþ is the mean value of temperature rise in the sensor due to a constant current pulse given by: \\x10 δt τð þ ¼ p0 π3=2ak \\x11−1d τð þ ð2þ where p0 is the total output of power from the sensor, a is the sensor radius, k is the thermal conductivity of the sample that is being tested and d(τ) is a dimensionless time dependent function with: τ ¼ t=θð ð3þ þ1=2; θ ¼ a2=d where t is the time measured from the start of the transient recording, θ is the characteristic time, which depends both on parameters of the sensor and the sample, and d is the thermal diffusivity of the sample. according to eq. (2), and δtðτþ and d(τ) plotted as a function of τ provides a linear relationship with a slope that is a function of p0, a, and k. thermal conductivity k can be obtained by ﬁtting the experimental data to the straight line given by eq. (2); thermal diffusivity d is calculated from eq. (3) taking into account the τ value determined in the previous ﬁt. as mentioned above, the solution of the thermal conductivity equation is based on the assumption that the hot disk sensor is located in an inﬁnite material in perfect contact with the sensor surface. this means that the heat ﬂow generated from each measurement must not reach the outside boundaries of the specimen (hot disk, 2007). meanwhile, a careful preparation of specimen ends is required to minimize thermal contact resistance. an estimation of how far the heat ﬂow has proceeded in the specimen during a recording is the probing depth δp, which is deﬁned as (hot disk, 2007): ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ p dt δp ¼ 2 ð4þ to determine the thermal conductivity with good accuracy, the shortest distance from any part of the sensor to the nearest outside boundary of the sample should be larger than δp. in our experiments, the used hot disk sensor has a radius of 6.403 mm. the shortest distance is about 19 mm, and the probing depth is approximately 10 mm. for this probing depth value, we can consider that we are conducting a bulk measurement. 3.3. test procedures 3.3.1. tests on specimens under saturated and dry conditions firstly, the specimens were immersed by deionized water in a vacuum for a period of 96 h. the specimens were then taken from the vacuum and the water droplets on the surfaces were wiped dry, care being taken to ensure that no rock grains or fragments were lost. the mass of the water-saturated specimens (msat) was measured using a\\x0cx.g.  / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137 129 loading measurement 60 50

precision balance (to 0.0001 g). our tests revealed that the mass of the specimens could be approximately constant under vacuum within 72 h (see ), indicating that the specimens were saturated with water. subsequently, the hot disk sensor was horizontally placed between the two saturated specimen pieces with the double spiral centered and totally covered, and the two specimen pieces were ﬁrmly clamped together to ensure that there was no air gap between the sensor and the specimen end surfaces, as presented in d. in order to remain water saturation, the saturated specimens and the sensor were kept in a plastic bag during thermal conductivity measurement (adl-zarrabi, 2004). after the test, the used water-saturated specimens were suffered from dehydration treatment in a thermostatic drying oven at 105 °c for a period of 24 h and subsequently cooled in a desiccator to measure the thermal conductivity under a dry condition. meanwhile, the mass of the dry specimens (mdry) was measured, and the porosity (n) of the specimens was calculated using the equations n ¼ 100v p v % v p ¼ msat − mdry ρw ð5þ ð6þ where v is the bulk rock volume, vp is the pore volume, and ρw is the density of water. for each pair of specimens saturated or dried, measurements on the thermal conductivity were carried out at room temperature (25 ± 1 °c). 3.3.2. tests on specimens under increasing temperature to investigate the effect of temperature on the thermal conductivity of the tested rocks, measurements were performed on dry specimens from 40 °c to 150 °c based on the requirements of the used test equipment. compared with measurements at room temperature, the experiments under high temperature are time consuming due to a slow stepwise heating process by using a constant temperature oil bath and a temperature control system, as shown in c. the thermal conductivity measurement can only be conducted until the two specimen pieces in the chamber with a specimen holder within the oil bath have reached thermal equilibrium and kept a target temperature value. during thermal equilibrium of the oil bath, the hot disk sensor monitors continuously the temperature variation of the specimens. for our tests, the thermal conductivity of the specimens was measured when the recorded temperature variation of the specimens is less than 0.04 °c. in general, 32 h were needed to complete

measurement, the load was maintained constant for a period of about 15 min to avoid residual temperature drifts on the specimens. based on the in-situ stress measurement results obtained from the beishan area (, 2013), the maximum axial compression stress applied to the specimens was set to be 45 mpa to approximately simulate the excavation-induced stress near the vertical hlw disposal element boundary at a depth of 600 m. the axial stress applied to the specimens was recorded automatically, and the used stress path throughout the course of testing is presented in . the experiments were conducted at room temperature. according to previous experimental results (, 2015a; , 2015b), the identiﬁed crack initiation stresses of cylindrical specimens of beishan granitic rocks under uniaxial compression using the cumulative ae hit (caeh) method range from 45.3 to 109.1 mpa, which are larger than the maximum compression stress adopted in the present study. hence, the stress-induced rock damage might not occur in the tested specimens during loading. it should be mentioned that in the process of loading, the friction may occur at the interfaces between the specimen ends and the sensor. due to limitation of the tps measurement technique, the utilized test method does not consider the potential inﬂuence of interface friction effect on the experimental results. to reduce or eliminate the friction effect, further efforts are needed to produce innovative design for the test equipment. although not perfect, the developed test system provides a feasible means for us to gain insight into thermal conductivity behaviors of rocks under compression. 4. test results 4.1. inﬂuence of water saturation on the thermal conductivity  porosity, thermal conductivity and effect of water

about how the gradual heating and the thermal equilibrium processes would affect the water content of the specimens, leading to difﬁculties in evaluating the relationship between the thermal conductivity and the water saturation degree of the specimens quantitatively. 3.3.3. tests on specimens under uniaxial compression the uniaxial compression tests on dry specimens were conducted using a hydraulic servo-controlled compression machine. for each test, two specimen pieces with the hot disk sensor were contained between steel platens machined to match their end surfaces, as shown in b. the interfaces between the specimens and the steel platens were daubed with a thin layer of lubricant to reduce the end effect of the platens during loading. when the experimental setup was completed, axial-load control was used with a loading rate of 100 n/s and the axial load was increased with an increment thermal conductivity measurements were carried out on the 40 pairs of specimens both in dry and water-saturated conditions, and the results are listed in . a statistical analysis shows that for the eight rock groups under dry or saturated state, the standard deviation (sd) and coefﬁcient of variation (cov) of the thermal conductivity are all less than 0.06 w/mk and 4%, respectively, indicating that the results between specimens in each rock group have a good consistency. for all rock groups, the average thermal conductivity values in the dry state (kdry) range between 2.412 and 2.812 w/mk. the values under watersaturated condition (ksat) for the same set of specimens range from

higher thermal conductivity (0.604 w/mk) replaced the air with a lower thermal conductivity (0.025 w/mk) in the void of the rocks, leading to an increase of the thermal conductivity. for our data set,

seen that the thermal conductivity of the specimens shows a decaying trend with increasing temperature, and the values at 150 °c range from 5.7% to 8.7% lower than those at room temperature. this means that within the used temperature range, the inﬂuence of the increasing temperature on the decay of thermal conductivity for these rocks is limited. on the other hand, a possible reason for the gradual decrease in thermal conductivity is the generation of thermally induced microcracks in the rocks because of a mismatch between thermal expansion coefﬁcients of adjacent mineral grains in a homogeneous temperature ﬁeld (, 1993), which has been demonstrated from a microcracking perspective based on numerical simulations (zhao, 2016). based on the experimental data, the relationship between thermal conductivity and temperature can be described using the equation: k ¼ kr − at2 ð8þ where kr is the thermal conductivity of the rock at room temperature (25 °c), t is the temperature in celsius, and a is the ﬁt coefﬁcient (see ). the parameter a affects the decaying velocity of the thermal conductivity with the temperature, i.e., the decaying velocity of the thermal conductivity increases as a increases. as shown in , a in eq.

clauser, 2009) have been proposed. comprehensive overviews and case studies on such mixing models can be found in (, 2009; clauser, 2009; , 2013; hartmann, 2005; , 2015). based on the experimental data (see ) in combination with the methodology used by  (2013), the abovementioned mixing models were used to predict the thermal conductivity values of the tested rocks in the water-saturated state.  shows the comparison between measured and calculated thermal conductivities for the four different models. it can be observed from a, b, and d that the geometric mean, the arithmetic mean, and the effectivemedium mean yield similar prediction results and consistently underestimate the thermal conductivity of the eight rock groups, especially for the groups with relatively high porosity values (e.g., groups bs05 and bs15). the hashin–shtrikman mean shows a reasonably good ﬁt for all rock groups, as shown in c. the analysis results are basically in line with observations reported by  (2013) because most of the evaluated mixing models used in their analysis also underestimate the thermal conductivity of the rocks. however, the geometric mean model was rated as the best ﬁt to their data set. it should be noted that the rocks used in their analysis covered different rock types with a large range in porosity, from almost zero to about 30%. in addition, the measured thermal conductivity values of these rocks spans the interval between 1.0 and 6.5 w/mk. the present investigations focused mainly on the granitic rocks with low porosities and a narrow thermal conductivity range. hence, the large difference of rock properties may result in uncertainties between analysis results obtained from various mixing models. more work is required to explain this discrepancy. nagaraju and roy (2014) deﬁned the effect of water saturation on thermal conductivity (s) as a function of porosity of rocks, and s is expressed by s ¼ ksat − kdry ð7þ kdry according to the measurement results listed in , we established the relationship between s and the porosity of the rocks, as presented in . analysis of  reveals that the effect of water saturation on thermal conductivity of rocks presents an increasing trend with an increase of porosity. a linear form expression can ﬁt the data reasonably well while ensuring that the line passes through the origin. 4.2. inﬂuence of temperature on the thermal conductivity  presents the variation of thermal conductivity of seven pairs of dry specimens in different rock groups with temperature from 40 °c  fit coefﬁcient a for thermal conductivity-temperature curves of seven pairs of specimens in different rock groups. rock type and specimen no. monzogranite (bs05-07) granodiorite (bs06-05) monzogranite (bs15-07) granodiorite (bs16-05) monzogranite (bs18-1-08) granodiorite (bs18-2-05) monzogranite (bs19-1-07) a (10−6) 8.821 5.679 8.394 4.871 6.891 5.728 6.385 r2 0.9830 0.9334 0.9853 0.9289 0.9262 0.9581 0.9933 132 x.g.  / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137\\x0cx.g.  / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137 133 n=2 20 10 axial stress (mpa) 30 40 n=3 20 10 axial stress (mpa) 30 40 50 50 3.4 3.3 3.2 3.1 3.0 2.9 2.8 2.7 2.6 2.5 2.4 c thermal conductivity (w/mk) 50 0 f 2.9 2.8 2.7 2.6 2.5 2.4 thermal conductivity (w/mk) 50 0 n=3 20 10 axial stress (mpa) 30 40 n=3 20 10 axial stress (mpa) 30 40 bs05 bs06 bs15 bs16 bs18-1 bs18-2 bs19-1 bs19-2 y=24.15-24.99e-x (r2=0.9296) 21 18 15 12 0369 i r(%) n=1 20 10 axial stress (mpa) 30 40 50 0.0 0.3 0.9 1.2 0.6 porosity (%) 1.5 1.8 b 3.0 2.9 2.8 2.7 2.6 2.5 2.4 thermal conductivity (w/mk) 50 0 3.2e 3.1 3.0 2.9 2.8 2.7 2.6 2.5 2.4 thermal conductivity (w/mk) 50 0 3.2h 3.1 3.0 2.9 2.8 2.7 2.6 thermal conductivity (w/mk) 50 0 n=3 20 10 axial stress (mpa) 30 40 n=3 20 10 axial stress (mpa) 30 40 n=2 20 10 axial stress (mpa) 30 40 3.0 2.9 2.8 2.7 2.6 2.5 2.4 2.3 2.2 a thermal conductivity (w/mk) 3.0d 2.9 2.8 2.7 2.6 2.5 2.4 2.3 2.2 2.1 2.0 thermal conductivity (w/mk) 3.0g 2.9 2.8 2.7 2.6 2.5 2.4 thermal conductivity (w/mk) 0 0 0 . inﬂuence of axial compression stress on the thermal conductivity of the eight rock groups: (a) bs05, (b) bs06, (c) bs15, (d) bs16, (e) bs18-1, (f) bs18-2, (g) bs19-1 and (h) bs19-2, and variation of the increase rate of the thermal conductivity (r) with rock porosity (i). error bars indicate the standard deviation of the thermal conductivity. n in the ﬁgures represents the number of specimen pairs in each rock group. we attempted to relate a with other rock parameters and found that a depended on the magnitude of rock porosity (n), as presented in . the coefﬁcient a varies with porosity n according to the following equation: a ¼ 9:43 − 0:71=n2 ð9þ according to eqs.

(11) is not sensitive to the variation of rock porosity, and is within the range from 0.20 to 0.27 except for the rock group bs19-1. for simplicity, an average value of c = 0.24 obtained from  is used to approximately describe the trend, as shown in b. using eqs. (11)–(12) and the constant coefﬁcient c, an overall ﬁt is made for these rock groups to reproduce the rock porosity-dependent thermal conductivity under different axial stresses. a comparison between individual and overall ﬁt results is presented in . it is found that for each rock group subjected to different compression stresses, the difference of the thermal conductivity values from the individual and overall ﬁts is less than 0.05 w/mk. the good agreement indicates that the established rock porosity-dependent model can capture the nonlinear stress-thermal conductivity relationships of the beishan granitic rocks satisfactorily. 5. discussion one of the ﬁndings from the experimental investigations in the previous sections is that the rock porosity has an inﬂuence on the thermal conductivity of the beishan granitic rocks under water saturation, increasing temperature and compression stress conditions, although the porosity of tested rocks is relatively low. it is well known that for low-porosity crystalline rocks, the mineral composition plays an important role in dominating the thermal conductivity. the crystalline rocks are mainly made up of quartz, feldspars, and maﬁc minerals such as pyroxene, amphibole and biotite, and the content of minerals from these three mineral groups basically determines a rock's thermal conductivity (clauser and huenges, 1995). as mentioned in section 2, a model analysis on a total of 46 thin sections of the rocks was conducted to identify the dominant minerals in the rocks. as listed in , the main minerals of these rocks include quartz, plagioclase, k-feldspar and biotite. among these four minerals, quartz has the highest thermal conductivity (7.69 w/mk) while another three minerals have a thermal conductivity range between 1.70 and 2.29 w/mk (horai, 1971). hence, when the porosity values of the specimens in different rock groups are close to each other, quartz content in the rocks may determine the thermal conductivity. according to the data listed in , a presents the inﬂuence of quartz content on the average thermal conductivity of different rock groups in dry state. it is seen that except for rock groups bs05 and bs15 (which have relatively large porosity values of 1.37% and 0.68%, respectively), thermal conductivity of the rocks appears an increasing trend with increasing quartz content. when the specimens are subjected to compression stresses, the original pores and cracks in the rocks tend to close, and the effective contact areas between mineral grains increase, leading to a signiﬁcant decay of the porosity effect on the thermal conductivity, especially for rocks with relatively high porosity. on the other hand, the closure of pores and cracks increases the contact opportunity of quartz grains, and hence improves the transportation capability of heat ﬂow in the rocks. under this condition, an obvious increase of the thermal conductivity for all rock groups with increasing quartz content can be observed, as presented in b. 6. conclusions beishan granitic rocks are candidate host rock types for china's hlw repository. in this paper, thermal conductivity characteristics of the beishan granitic rocks have been investigated using the transient plane source (tps) method. the measurement results indicate that for the used eight rock groups with a porosity range from 0.40% to 1.37%, the average thermal conductivity values in the dry state range between 2.412 and 2.812 w/mk. the values under water-saturated condition range from 2.602 to 3.156 w/mk. meanwhile, the effect of water saturation on thermal conductivity presents an increasing trend with an increase of rock porosity. using several mixing models proposed by previous researchers, we found that the hashin–shtrikman mean model showed a reasonably good ﬁt to the experimental data while another three models currently obtained data, a best ﬁtting equation of axial stressdependent thermal conductivity for these rocks can be expressed as (, 2004) k ¼ k0 þ bσ c ð11þ 1 where k0 is the thermal conductivity of the rock at zero stress, σ1 is the axial stress, and b and c are ﬁt coefﬁcients, as listed in . analysis of eq. (11) reveals that the coefﬁcient b plays a critical role in controlling the increasing gradient of the thermal conductivity in the initial loading stage (i.e., crack closure stage). the coefﬁcient c dominantly affects the increasing velocity of the thermal conductivity in the subsequent elastic deformation stage. based on experimental investigations on the thermal conductivity of some rocks subjected to uniaxial stresses using a steady-state apparatus developed by  (2004),  (2008) found that the parameters b and c depended on the magnitude of elastic modulus of the rocks, and subsequently established an elastic modulus dependent model to predict the thermal conductivity values under pressure. unfortunately, in the present study, the elastic moduli of the tested rocks have not been available. therefore, the model proposed by  (2008) cannot be used to ﬁt our test results. according to , we found that the increasing gradients of the thermal conductivities in the initial loading stage were generally large for the rocks with a high porosity such as rock groups bs05 and bs15. hence, the coefﬁcient b is associated with the rock porosity n, i.e., b increases as n

conductivity of the rocks under the water-saturated condition. future work is demanded to verify the validity of various mixing models using different rock types with a large porosity range. with increasing temperature from 25 °c to 150 °c, the thermal conductivity of the rocks shows a decaying trend and the values at 150 °c range from 5.7% to 8.7% lower than those at room temperature, revealing that the inﬂuence of temperature on the thermal conductivity of the tested rocks is limited. in addition, the thermal conductivity of the rocks increases with increasing compression stress in a nonlinear behavior, and the increase rate of the thermal conductivity increases with an increase of rock porosity. it is found that the effects of compression stress and water saturation on the magnitude of thermal conductivity of the rocks are basically comparable. based on the experimental data, the empirical models considering the inﬂuence of rock porosity have been established for predicting the temperature and compression stress dependent thermal conductivity characteristics of the rocks, and the predictions are found to be in good agreement with experimental results. this study thus emphasizes importance of porosity on thermal conductivity measurements even for low porosity crystalline rocks. when the pores and cracks in the rocks tend to close during compression, quartz content may determine the thermal conductivity, and there exists an increase of the thermal conductivity with increasing quartz content. this is because the closure of pores and cracks increases the contact opportunity of quartz grains, and hence improves the transportation capability of heat ﬂow in the rocks. while the test results provide insights into the thermal conductivity characteristics of beishan granitic rocks, one should be aware of the limitation of this study. because the thermal conductivity of granitic rocks is inﬂuenced by many factors. in order to better understand the thermal conductivity of granitic rocks related to rock characteristics such as rock fabric, grain shape, grain contact and grain size, comprehensive petrographic investigations are recommended in the future. in the meantime, studies should be carried out to understand how the interactions between mineral components affect the thermal conductivity. work is also being conducted to investigate the thermal conductivity of the rocks under coupled thermal-hydro-mechanical conditions. acknowledgments this work has been supported by the china atomic energy authority through the
