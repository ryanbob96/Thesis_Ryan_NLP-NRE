       "'THE\\n\\nAMERICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE\\n[FIFTH SERIES.]\\n\\n———_#oe\\n\\nArt, VI.—The Thermal Conductivity and Compressi-\\nbility of several Rocks under High Pressures; by\\nP. W. Brineman.\\n\\nINTRODUCTION.\\n\\nThe effect of pressure on the thermal conductivity of\\nrocks has apparently never been determined, although a\\nknowledge of it is important in calculating the thermal\\nequilibrium of the earth’s crust. The only measure-\\nments we have that can give any idea of the possible\\ninfluence of hydrostatic pressure are on the effect of one-\\nsided compression on the thermal conductivity of granite\\nand marble.t It1is of course well known that a one-sided\\ncompression need not be at all like a hydrostatic pres-\\nsure in its effects, and the only conclusion that we can\\ndraw from the experiments of Lees as applied to condi-\\ntions within the crust of the earth is that the effect of\\npressure is probably not very large. .\\n\\nIn connection with my work on the effect of high pres-\\nsures on general physical properties of various sub-\\nstances, I have recently been engaged in measuring the\\nthermal conductivity of-a number of liquids up to 12000\\nke/em?. Since the apparatus could be adapted without\\nmuch trouble to measure the effect of pressure on the\\nthermal conductivity of those solids whose conductivity\\nis not too high, such as the rocks, I thought it of interest\\nto make a few measurements from which at least the\\ngeneral trend of the effects to be expected could be\\ninferred. I have been encouraged in this attempt by\\nthe interest and advice of Professor R. A. Daly, who also\\nwas so kind as to obtain several of the materials for me.\\nI also have to thank my assistant, Mr. H. B. Curry, for\\nmaking many of the readings.\\n\\n1For references see the end of this article.\\n\\nAm. Jour. Scr.— Firtx Sreriss, Vou. VII, No. 388.—Frpsrvuary, 1924.\\n6\\n 82 P., W. Bridgman—Thermal Conductivity and\\n\\nIn addition to the thermal conductivity I have deter-\\nmined the compressibility of the materials used. It was\\ncomparatively easy to do this as the apparatus had\\nalready been developed for another purpose. When I\\nbegan these measurements the important paper of Adams\\nand Williamson? on the compressibility of rocks had not\\nappeared, and such questions as that of the change with\\npressure of the compressibility of a rock had not received\\nan answer. Since the appearance of that paper, my\\ncompressibility results lose some of their novel interest,\\nbut there are still a number of points in connection with\\nthem which I think may suggest new lines of thought.\\nIn the first place, I have measured the compressibility\\nof several of my materials at two temperatures, neither\\nvery high it is true, 30° and 75°, but nevertheless suffi-\\nciently far apart to give an idea of the variation of\\ncompressibility with temperature. This of course is\\nimportant when applying results obtained in the labora-\\ntory at room temperatures to actual conditions. The\\nnecessary information can not be obtained from the\\nresults of Adams and Williamson because their compres-\\nsibilities were measured at only one temperature. In\\nthe second place, my method, which measures the linear\\nas opposed to the cubical compressibility, brings out the\\nimportance of non-isotropy, as the measurements of\\nAdams and Williamson on cubical compressibility can-\\nnot do. I have found surprisingly large differences of\\ncompressibility in different directions, and also entirelv\\nunexpected and abnormal hysteresis relations. Both\\nthese factors are of importance in calculating the velocity\\nof propagation of earthquake waves or other deforma-\\ntional effects in the earth’s crust.\\n\\nThermal Conductivity.\\n\\nThe Method.—The method used for measuring thermal\\nconductivity is essentially the same as that used for\\nliquids, and is deseribed in detail elsewhere;? a brief\\nsummary here will suffice. The material whose conduc-\\ntivity is to be measured is worked to the form of a cylin-\\ndrical shell, which is slipped between an outer and an\\ninner cylinder of copper, each of which it fits accurately.\\nAn insulated wire stretched along the axis of the inner\\ncopper evlinder carries an electric current, so that the\\n Compressibility of Rocks under Pressure. 91\\n\\nentertain the possibility of the conductivity being several\\nfold greater than the accepted value.\\n\\nPyrex glass does not depart from the average crys-\\ntalline rock in the effect of pressure on conductivity,\\nalthough the absolute conductivity is lower, as is usually\\nthe case for a glass.\\n\\nCompressibility.\\n\\nThe normal behavior of compressibility is as follows.\\nWhen a homogeneous isotropic solid is subjected to\\nhydrostatic pressure it experiences a uniform change of\\ndimensions in all directions, so that the geometrical\\nshape of any part of the solid is unaltered; this change\\nof dimensions is a function of the pressure and tempera-\\nture only and does not depend in any way on the past\\npressure history of the specimen. In other words, there\\nare no hysteresis, elastic-after-effects, or allied phenom-\\nena, but the strain is a single valued function of the\\npressure. The percentage change of volume for a given\\nincrement of pressure in all cases hitherto examined\\nbecomes less at the higher pressures (that is, the com-\\npressibility decreases at high pressures), and in nearly\\nall cases, although not universally, the compressibility\\nis greater at higher temperatures.\\n\\nFor the materials of this paper, this simple type of\\nbehavior is not always followed, but there are significant\\ndepartures. To exhibit these, it will be best to describe\\nthe results in detail.\\n\\nPipestone.—The first sample of this which I measured\\nbehaved in a way which was in one respect the most sig-\\nnificant and striking of any of this series. The experi-\\nmetal results are plotted in fig. 3, which shows the\\nobserved fractional changes of length against the corre-\\nsponding pressures. In the first place the change of\\nleneth is not a single valued function of the pressure but\\nthere is a very marked loop, in shape like the well known\\nhysteresis loops of magnetism or the stress-strain loops\\nof a substance stressed beyond the elastic limit. The\\ngreatest width of this loop was 18.2% of the maximum\\nchange of length. This loop is not a temporary phenom-\\nenon obtained only on the first application of pressure,\\nsuch as I have sometimes found, and which may be\\nexplained by flaws or crevices which are squeezed tight\\n 92 P. W. Bridgman—Thermal Conductivity and\\n\\nby a high pressure, but it is a legitimate and permanent\\neffect, which may be repeated, as this specimen had been\\nsubjected to a previous pressure seasoning. The two-\\npoints in fig. 3 which appear to be off the curve, at 1000\\n\\nand 10000 kg., were obtained by a slightly different pro-\\ncedure than the others, the 1000 point after a release of\\n\\nFie. 3.\\n\\nerrprepryport :\\none BESET ALE oa\\nsee cen he ETT |\\neecuaetel tadpi AP.\\n\\nTH fas\\nseated\\n\\n, iam\\nt rh E\\n\\n{ ET\\nac ene\\nSphere\\n\\nTt\\nttt\\n\\nomen ie .

Experi-\\nence with other lag effects would lead one to expect these\\npoints to lie off the curve in exactly the way found, and\\nthe fact that they were so found is confirmation of the\\nlegitimateness of the effect.\\n Compressibility of Rocks wnder Pressure. 93\\n\\nApart from the existence of the loop, the second sur-\\nprising feature is the direction in which it is described.\\n‘‘Hysteresis’’? means a lagging behind, and this suggests\\nin general the physical reason for the effect. Normal\\nhysteresis would demand that when pressure is released,\\ncoming from a higher value, for example, the change of\\nvolume does not assume the value appropriate to that\\npressure, but lags behind, assuming a value to be found\\nat some higher pressure on the ascending branch of\\ncurve. The physical reason is usually sought in internal\\nfriction or in some inherent small-scale instability except\\nwhen in one of two extreme configurations, as is best\\nuUlustrated in Ewing’s theory of ferro-magnetism.\\n\\nThe phenomena found here are the exact reverse of\\nnormal. On the descending branch of the curve the\\nchange of volume is that to be found at a lower instead of\\nat a higher pressure on the ascending branch. In other\\nwords, instead of this being a lag phenomenon, it 1s a\\nphenomenon of advance, and the loop is a reverse loop.\\nI have sometimes found effects like this, but only in com-\\nplicated systems in which the explanation can be found\\nin the interaction of a number of unlike phenomena, and\\nnever in such a marked degree as here. It is probable,\\nJ think, that there must be a complicated state of internal\\nstrains to account for such a state of affairs. An arti-\\nficial mechanism may be imagined, which may have some\\nrelation to the actual mechanism, which will give effects\\nof this kind. Suppose the solid contains a number of\\nlenticular cavities provided with a valve mechanism such\\nthat liquid can get from the outside into the interior only\\nwhen the pressure outside is in excess of that inside by a\\ndefinite amount, and similarly liquid can pass from the\\ninside out only when the pressure inside rises a definite\\namount above that outside. When fluid pressure\\nis applied to such a cavity, the first effect is to\\nsqueeze it flat, but when pressure rises high enough,\\nliquid penetrates to the inside and the cavity swells,\\ntending to resume its natural lenticular shape. When\\nthe external pressure 1s now removed, the eavity first\\nswells because of the volume expansion of the liquid\\ninside, but when pressure outside has decreased to a\\ncertain value, liquid comes out from the interior and the\\ncavity shrinks. That is, such a mechanism has an abnor-\\n 94 P. W. Bridgman—Thermal Conductivity and\\n\\nmally large compressibility during the initial stage and\\nan abnormally small compressibility during the final\\nstage of a pressure increase, with the reversed behavior\\nduring decrease, which is exactly the behavior of the\\nrever sed loop found above.\\n\\nThe importance of this effect in speculation is evident,\\nfor it is a consequence of it that the initial elastic con-\\nstants for small stress differences of a substance like\\npipestone may vary by a factor of more than two-fold,\\ndepending on the past stress history of the material.\\nFurthermore, the mean elastic constant will vary greatly\\nwith the magnitude of the deforming stress or the defor-\\nmation, so that it may be quite differ ent for the strains\\nwhich we have in tidal deformation and those found in\\nmountain building, for example.\\n\\nThe effect is so important that it seemed worth while\\nto verify it on other samples. Accordingly another\\nspecimen was tried in another apparatus, in order to\\neliminate any possibility of instrumental error. This\\nsecond specimen was measured at 30° and 75°. The\\neffect was again found, but much less in amount, the\\nwidth of the reverse loop being at 30° only 3.1% of the\\nmaximum effect, and at 75° 2.3%. The sample used with\\nthe second apparatus was a short rod about 2.5 cm. long,\\nwhereas that used with the first was 15 ecm. long. To\\nfurther make certain freedom from instrumental error,\\na piece 2.5 em. long was now cut from the first sample\\nand measured in the second apparatus at 30°. This\\nendeavor to ensure freedom from instrumental error was\\nreally quite superfluous because the identical apparatus\\nhad been used in measuring the compressibility of\\nmetals,’ whose changes of dimensions are much smaller,\\nwith no hysteresis or similar effects of as much as 0.1%.\\nThe effect was again found; the loop was again reverse,\\nand the width was 11.4% of the maximum. The shape\\nof the loop was not as regular as that found before, but\\nwas as indicated in fig. 4.\\n\\nIt is evident that the pipestone is not at all a homo-\\ngeneous material but that different parts differ greatly\\nin hysteresis effects, and presumably in internal strain.\\nAlong with differences in hysteresis goes a difference in\\nthe absolute compressibility ; the compressibility was\\nconsiderably less for the piece that showed large reverse\\nhysteresis. The following results were found:\\n Compressibility of Rocks under Pressure. 95\\n\\nFor the long rod with 18% reverse hysteresis the aver-\\nage linear compressibility between 0 and 12000 kg/cm?\\nwas at the rate of 4.34 X 107 per kg. For the short piece cut\\nfrom one end of the long rod the average change of length\\nbetween 0 and 12000 was at the rate of 3.87 X 10%. The\\nreverse loop of the other specimen was so narrow that it\\n\\nFia. 4.\\n\\nFic. 4.—The compressibility cycle of another sample of pipestone, change\\nof length against pressure. Again the direction of the loop is abnormal.\\n\\nwas possible to draw an average line half way between\\nthe ascending and descending branches of the curve.\\nThe change of length as a function of, pressure on this\\naverage line is given by the formulas:\\n\\nAZ\\nT = 6.50 x 10~\" 9 — 6.81 x 10-”* p? at 30°,\\n\\nGQ\\n\\nAl :\\nT= 6.89 KX 107 p — 5.81 X 107\" p’ at 75°.\\n\\nThe average linear compressibility of the specimen with\\nhttle reverse hysteresis is thus 50% greater than that of\\nthe other. Itis not to be expected that the compressibil-\\nity of material of this kind is the same in every direction,\\nand therefore the volume compressibility cannot be com-\\nputed from the linear compressibility in a_ single\\ndirection.\\n\\nIt is to be emphasized that the abnormal behavior of\\n 96 P. W. Bridgman—Thermal Conductivity and\\n\\npipestone may be expected to represent a lower rather\\nthan an upper limit to the abnormalities of the materials\\nof the earth’s crust in situ. For this piece of pipestone,\\nmeasured in a laboratory, was a small piece whose\\nexternal surfaces were free from stress, and in which\\nany internal strains must have been fairly small, because\\ndue to the differential strains in a small mass. The\\nrocks in the crust, however, are subjected to shearing\\nstresses up to the limit of their strength, and the stresses\\nvary greatly from place to place, so that the internal\\nstrains, and therefore probably elastic abnormalities,\\nmust be high.\\n\\nSolenhofen Iimestone.—This material was in the form\\nof a rod 10 em. long and roughly 6 mm. in diameter, cut\\nwith the diamond saw from the same piece as the thermal\\nconductivity cylinder. Its compressibility was measured\\nat 30° and 75°. At both these temperatures the same\\nreverse hysteresis was found as for pipestone, but much\\nless in amount. At 30° the width of the loop was 6.4%\\nof the maximum effect, and at 75° 2.4%. The effect\\ndecreases with rising temperature, as it did also for pipe-\\nstone, but by a much larger factor. A decrease with\\nrising temperature is what would be expected if it is an\\nInternal strain effect.\\n\\nAt 30° the average volume compressibility between 0\\nand 12000 kg/cm? is 0.0,1838 per kg., and at 75° 0.0,1392,\\nassuming equal compressibility in all directions. If the\\nmean compressihjlity is taken from a curve drawn half-\\nway between the ascending and descending branches of\\nthe hysteresis loop, then it will be found that the mean\\ncompressibility decreases with rising pressure, as is nor-\\nmal. The departure from linearity, which is about the\\nsame at both temperatures, is such that at 6000 kg. the\\nactual change of volume is about 4% greater than would\\nbe calculated by using the average compressibility\\nbetween 0 and 12000.\\n. Adams, Williamson, and Johnston’ found for the mean\\ncompressibility of CaCO, between 2000 and 10000 kg.\\n13.6 X 107, and found no variation with pressure. Their\\naverage figure agrees surprisingly well with the mean\\nvalue found above for limestone. :\\n\\nBasalt.—The sample used was about 2.5 em. long, and\\nwas the core of the thermal conductivity cylinder. It\\n Compressibility of Rocks under Pressure. 97\\n\\nwas measured at 30° and 75°. Again reverse hysteresis\\nwas found, but this time the greatest width of the loop\\nwas only 1.5% of the maximum effect. Within the limits\\nof error (not over 0.07%) the compressibility was the\\nsame at the two temperatures. If the mean of the\\nascending and descending branches of the loop is taken,\\nand the compressibility is assumed equal in all directions,\\nthen the relation between pressure and change of volume\\nis given by the formula: |\\n\\n.~ = 15.60 X 107’ p — 13.4 K 107\" pp’.\\n\\nAdams and Williamson? found for two diabases of\\ndensities 3.002 and 2.975, 12.4 *107 and 14.1 x 107\\nrespectively for the average compressibility between\\n2000 and 10000, with no perceptible variation with pres-\\nsure. My basalt, which is diabasic in character, was not\\nas dense; the agreement is as good as to be expected.\\n\\nTalc—Measurements were made on four samples.\\nThe first sample was a rod 10 em. long, not from the\\nidentical piece as the thermal conductivity sample, but\\nfrom the same lot. It was without evident schistosity\\nor other structure. It was measured at 30° and 75°.\\nThe smoothed results at these two temperatures were\\nsensibly the same, although at 75° there were perfectly\\nconsistent small departures from the usual course con-\\nsisting of a somewhat accelerated volume change at low\\npressures followed by a retardation, such that the total\\nvolume change at 12000 was the same as at 30°. There\\nwas no reverse hysteresis in perceptible amount. The rela-\\ntion between volume change and pressure for this\\nsample, assuming equal compressibility in all directions,\\nis given by the formula:\\n\\nAV\\nV\\n\\n— 10.4 X 10 \"p— 6.38 X 107\" p’.\\n\\n0\\n\\nThis compressibility is so much less than I expected\\nfrom the general softness of the substance, that the\\nquestion arose whether it was really equally compressible\\nin all directions. Professor Palache informed me that a\\nstructure would be expected from the manner of. depost-\\n\\nAm. Jour. Scr.—Firts Sreriss, Vou. VII, No. 38.—FrEsruary, 1924.\\n 98 iP. W.

He was so kind\\nas to select for me a sample from the same lot‘as the other\\nsamples which did show schistosity, the material evi-\\ndently having been laid down on a series of planes.\\nFrom this block three short rods were cut in directions\\nmutually at right angles, and the compressibility of each\\nof these rods was measured at 30°.\\n\\nThe results obtained for these three samples were all\\nperfectly regular, and without hysteresis, direct or\\nreverse. The relation between change of length and\\npressure could in each case be represented by an expres-\\nsion of the second degree in the pressure. The following\\nvalues were found:\\n\\nSample # I\\n\\nA\\nae 8.76 X 107\" p — 16.6 & 107\" p?\\n\\nSample # IT\\n\\nA\\nT= 5.69 X 107\" p — 5.49 K 107\" p”\\n\\nSample # ITI\\n\\nA ;\\nAl _ 3.84 x L077 p — 4.93 X-107\"? p?,\\n\\n0\\n\\nSamples I and III were cut parallel to the plane of\\nschistosity, while II was perpendicular to it. The results\\nshow in the first place a variation with direction of 2.3\\nfold, which is greater than I had expected in material of\\nthis character. In the second place, there is no immedi-\\nate connection evident with the plane of schistosity, the\\nlinear compressibility of II being intermediate between\\nthe other two.\\n\\nThe average initial volume compressibility, obtained\\nby adding the three initial linear compressibilities, 1s\\n18.3 x 107. The sample first measured was evidently\\n Compressibility of Rocks under Pressure. 99\\n\\ncut by accident along a direction of very low compressi-\\nbility. © ,\\n\\nIt is evident enough that a distortional wave through\\nmaterial of this character will not be propagated as\\nthrough a homogeneous isotropic substance.\\n\\nThe great variation found in the linear compressibility\\nof pipestone and tale probably has an important bearing\\non a suggestion in the recent paper of L. H. Adams and\\nWilliamson.!® These authors measured the cubic com-\\npressibility of rocks between 2000 and 12000 kg. by a\\ndirect method, but did not carry their results below\\n2000. EF. D. Adams and E. G. Coker,\" on the other hand,\\nhad measured the compressibility at low stresses by an\\nindirect method which involved the assumption of the\\nhomogeneity and isotropy of the material. They found\\ncompressibilities which in some cases were twice as high\\nas those found by L. H. Adams and Williamson. Adams\\nand Williamson reconcile the two sets of results by sup-\\nposing below 2000 kg. a very rapid increase of compressi-\\nbility, which is perhaps connected in some way with a\\nlooseness of structure of the rocks which disappears at\\nhigh pressures. Of course it is possible that this may\\nbe the correct explanation, and in any event the ultimate\\nanswer can only be obtained by a direct measurement of\\nthe comvressibility at low pressures, but in view of my\\nresults above it seems to me that a much more likely\\nexplanation is that the values of F. D. Adams and Coker\\nare in error because of failure of the necessary isotropy.\\nDifferences of elastic properties with direction of the\\nmagnitude which I have found above would be more than\\nsufficient to explain the divergent results. ,\\n\\nPyrex Glass.—This material was in the form of a rod\\nabout 15 cm. long and 6 mm. in diameter. It was from\\nthe same length of tubing as the thermal conductivity\\nsample, and was made from it by working in the fire into\\na solid rod and drawing down. It was not perfectly\\nhomogeneous, but there were a few minute bubbles in it.\\n\\nThe compressibility was measured at 30° and 75°.\\nThe results were very regular and self-consistent. The\\nmaximum. departure of any point from a smooth curve\\nwas 0.36% of the maximum effect. There was no\\nhysteresis of any kind. Within the limits of error there\\nwas no difference between the compressibility at the two\\ntemperatures. Assuming equal compressibility in all\\n 100) PP. W. Bridgman—Thermal Conductivity and\\n\\ndirections, the relation between pressure and change of\\nvolume is given by the formula:\\n\\nAV\\nv\\n\\n0\\n\\n= 80.27 & LO p+ 9.9 x 107? p?,\\n\\nThis glass shows the abnormal feature, the first time\\nthat I have found it, of a compressibility which increases\\nat high pressures. The effect is comparatively large,\\nand much beyond the possibility of any experimental\\nerror, As I have already said elsewhere in discussing\\nthe possibility of such an effect,!? there seems to be no\\nfundamental reason why the effect should not -exist, but\\nit certainly is not what we expect. One might be inclined\\nto search for a connection between the effect and the\\nminute bubbles in the glass, but the effect of bubbles\\nwould be expected to be in the opposite direction, giving\\ntoo high a compressibility at low pressures before the\\nbubbles close up, and furthermore if the bubbles are\\nnumerous enough to have a perceptible effect on com-\\npressibility, one would look for hysteresis arising from\\nnon-hydrostatie internal strains in the neighborhood of\\nthe bubbles.*\\n\\nEvidence confirming the reality of this effect may be\\ndrawn from the work of Adams, Williamson,’? and\\nJohnston on compressibility. They found for all their\\nmaterials whose compressibility was as high as this a\\ndecrease of compressibility with rising pressure with the\\nexception of silica glass, which was constant between\\n2000 and 8000 kg.,in spite of the comparatively high\\nvalue of its compressibility, 3.1 x 10*. Now the experi-\\nments of Adams, Williamson and Johnston are not as\\nsensitive as these to changes of compressibility with\\npressure, and it may well be that if they did not find the\\neffect it is really negative. At any rate it is abnormally\\nsmall.\\n\\nThe compressibility of the pyrex found above,\\n3.03 & 10°, is unusually high for a glass which for ordi-\\nnary compositions is in the neighborhood of 2.3. The\\n\\n* Note added on reading proof. The abnormal change of compressibility\\nwith pressure has now been verified on a sample of pyrex glass free from\\nflaws and thoroughly annealed, prepared for me by the Corning Glass Works\\nfor this express purpose.\\n Compressibility of Rocks under Pressure. 83\\n\\naxis is a source of heat. This heat flows out radially\\nthrough the inner copper cylinder, through the shell of\\nrock, through the outer copper cylinder, and into the\\nsurrounding temperature bath through the walls of the\\npressure eylinder into which the outer copper cylinder\\nclosely fits. The difference of temperature between the\\ninner and outer copper cylinders is measured with\\nthermo-couples. From a- knowledge of the heat input,\\nthe temperature difference and the geometrical config-\\nuration, the thermal conductivity may be computed.\\n\\nThe interior of the pressure cylinder, in which the\\nthermal conductivity apparatus is contained, is entirely\\nfilled with an electrically insulating liquid (petroleum\\nether for 30° and kerosene for 75°) in which the conduc-\\ntivity cylinders are completely bathed. Pressure may be\\napplied to this liquid by means of the intensifier which I\\nhave often described.t| The pressure is transmitted by\\nthe liquid equally to all parts of the conductivity appa-\\nratus. The thermal conductivity may now be determined\\nas a function of the pressure in the liquid.\\n\\nThe most important correction to be applied to the\\nreadings directly obtained is that due to the lack\\nof perfect fit between the cylinder of rock and the inner.\\nand outer copper cylinders. It was of course not possi-\\nble to make the fit perfect, so that in addition to the rock\\nin which we are interested there was always a film of\\nliquid between the two copper cylinders. What was\\nactually measured was the resultant conductivity of\\nlayers of rock and liquid in series. Since the thermal\\nconductivity of the liquid is much less than that of the\\nrock, it is necessary to know the geometrical dimensions\\naccurately. The cylinders were formed by machining\\nor grinding, and were of a gratifying geometrical reg-\\nularity. The outside diameter was uniform within a few\\nten-thousandths of an inch, as was also the length. The\\noutside measurements could be made with sufficient\\naccuracy with ordinary micrometers, and mean dimen-\\nsions obtained from a large number of readings. The\\ninside diameter could not be measured directly. This\\nwas obtained from the total weight of the specimen, its\\ndensity (which was determined by weighing in water in\\nthe regular way), and the outside dimensions. The cop-\\nper cylinders could be measured directly with sufficient\\n Compressibility of Rocks under Pressure. 101\\n\\nvalue for pyrex is close to the value of Adams, William-\\nson, and Johnston for silica glass, suggesting a similarity\\nof effect.\\n\\nThis increase of compressibility at high pressures\\ndeserves to be more extensively investigated with other\\nmaterials.\\n\\nSummary.\\n\\nThermal Conductivity—The thermal conductivity of\\npipestone, tale, Solenhofen limestone, basalt, pyrex glass\\nand rock salt has been measured up to 12000 kg/cm? at\\n30° and in most cases at 75° also. The conductivity\\nincreases with rising pressure by an amount which may\\nvary from 0.1% per 1000 kg. at 30° for Solenhofen lime-\\nstone to 3.6% for rock salt. Probably for the ordinary\\nrock of the earth’s crust the effect is not over 0.5% at\\nordinary temperatures. The absolute conductivity and\\nits pressure coefficient may either increase or decrease\\nwith rising temperature.\\n\\nCompressibility—A simple hydrostatic pressure\\napplied to substances of the character of those measured\\nhere does not in general produce a uniform change of\\nvolume, but the effects are complicated. The relation\\nbetween pressure and deformation may be affected by\\nhvsteresis in a direction the reverse of normal; I have\\nfound this in pipestone, Solenhofen- limestone, and\\nbasalt in amounts varying from a few per cent to 18 per\\ncent of the whole deformation. Tale and pipestone show\\nlarge differences of linear compressibility in different\\ndirections; this effect was not investigated for the other\\nmaterials. Pyrex glass has an abnormal increase of\\ncompressibility at high pressures.\\n\\nGeological Consequences.—As far as the results on\\nthermal conductivity go, only rough conclusions can be\\ndrawn, but it would seem that in view of the possible\\nvariations found with pressure and temperature one\\nshould be prepared in geological speculations to con-\\nsider that thermal conductivity at a depth of several\\nhundred miles may be several fold greater than the value\\nnow accepted.\\n\\nThat the compressibility is different in different direc-\\ntions suggests that deep in the earth’s crust where there\\nare large differential stresses, with the probability of\\n 102.

From the dimensions of the solid parts, the\\ndimensions of the liquid layer could be determined. The\\ndimensions of the rock cylinders were approximately\\n0.5000 inches (1.27 em.) outside diameter and 0.4000\\n(1.02 em.) inside diameter and 1 inch (2.5 em.) long.\\n\\nFig. 1.—Cross section of the thermal conductivity measuring apparatus.\\n\\' Horizontal shading represents copper, diagonal shading the rock under\\nmeasurement, and the unshaded part the pressure transmitting liquid.\\n\\nIn fig. 1 is shown a cross section of the thermal con-\\nductivity apparatus, in which the cylinder of rock is\\nshown shaded diagonally between the outer and inner\\neylinders of copper (horizontally shaded) separated\\nfrom them by the unshaded layers of liquid.

There is, however, a geometrical\\ncorrection due to the change with pressure of the length\\nof the axis of the cylinder, but this correction is so small\\nthat it was neglected in the present work.\\n\\nThe formula gives at once the means of calculating the\\nconductivity of the rock if that of the surrounding liquid\\nis known. This was determined as a function of pressure\\nby the experiments on liquids, and the numerical values\\nmay be found in the paper describing those experiments.\\nThe correction for the liquid was of the order of one-\\nthird or one-quarter of the total effect at atmospheric\\npressure. Under the maximum pressure the conductiv-\\nity of the liquid increases by a factor of 2.7, so that the\\ncorrection is correspondingly reduced at the high pres-\\nsures. ‘T\\'he results are, therefore, better at the high than\\nat the low pressures.\\n\\nChoice of Materials ——The chief restriction on the\\nchoice of materials was the necessity of being able to\\nwork them into accurate cylindrical shells.

The other materials\\n\\n_@7i\\n6,—8.= | log\\n 86 =P. W. Bridgman—Thermal Conductivity and\\n\\nI chose after conference with Professor Daly, the object\\nbeing to obtain a few materials which could be worked\\nwith some degree of ease, and which at the same time.\\nin conjunction with the tale and pipestone already\\nselected, should fairly represent the range of material\\nto be encountered in the earth’s crust. It was at his sug-\\ngestion that Solenhofen limestone and a diabasic basalt\\nwere selected. Both of these were too hard to machine,\\nand had to be worked to shape by grinding. I am\\nindebted to Mr. David Mann for devising a method of\\ndoing this, and to my mechanic Mr. T. R. Richardson for\\nskillfully preparing the specimens. In addition to these,\\npyrex glass was also measured at the suggestion of Pro-\\nfessor Daly, who recognized the importance of an\\nexample of a glassy non-crystalline material. This was\\nnot prepared by grinding, but was cut into the proper\\nlength from a piece of commercial tubing of such size as\\nto fit closely the copper cylinders both inside and outside.\\nThis specimen was selected personally by Professor Daly\\nafter detailed examination of an extensive commercial\\nstock. HEven with this care, the glass was not as perfect\\ngeometrically as the ground specimens, but showed\\neccentricities of 1.5%. Mean dimensions of the glass\\nwere used in the ealenlations.\\n\\nIn addition to the rocks I have measured the thermal\\neonduetivity of rock salt under pressure, chiefly for its\\nphysical interest, as we are now becoming able to explain\\na good many of the physical properties of simple\\nerystals, and of rock salt in particular, in terms of the\\nfine structure, and the thermal conductivity of no simple\\nerystal has been measured under pressure.\\n\\nAnalysis of the Materials.—The pipestone was obtained\\nfrom the Ward Natural History Establishment at\\nRochester, N. Y., and is the material described by Dana\\nas ‘‘eatlinite.’’ It is an iron-rich clay stone; a typical\\nanalysis gives: SiO, 57.4, Al.O, 25.9, Fe.O, 8.7, H.O 7.4,\\nMgO and CaO trace. It is without ovitty inclusions of\\nany kind, and may be turned in the lathe without damage\\nto the keen edge of a steel tool. The material was not per-\\nfectly homogeneous in appearance, but the color varied\\nfrom a deep red to a much paler and yellowish hue. The\\nthermal conductivity sample was a deep red throughout.\\nIts density at 20° was 2.840 (corrected for vacunm, as\\nare all the densities given in the following).\\n land\\n\\nCompressibility of Rocks under Pressure. 8\\n\\nThe tale was from the Hewitt mine, Hewitt, N. C. and\\nwas very soft without any gritty inclusions. The analy-\\nsis is given as follows in Heconomic Paper No. 3, 1900, of\\nthe N. C. Geological Survey: Water 5.10; Silica (Si0,)\\n61.35; Al,O, 4.42; FeO 1.68; CaO 0.82; MgO 26.03;\\nNa,.O 0.62; and K,O trace.\\n\\nThe material is not perfectly homogeneous, but there\\nis a certain amount of schistosity evident, the material\\nhaving apparently been laid down im layers. The den-\\nsity at 20° 1s 2.701. ,\\n\\nThe Solenhofen limestone is very nearly pure CaCO...\\nIt is of a light brownish color, and was deposited in\\nlayers from one-half to three-quarters of an inch thick.\\nThe thermal conductivity and the compressibility samples\\nwere cut from the same layer. The density at 20° is\\n2.602.\\n\\nThe diabasic basalt is described as follows by Profes-\\nsor K. S. Larsen of the University Museum; I am much\\nindebted to him for procuring the analysis.\\n\\n‘“‘The sample is made up in large part of labradorite laths\\nand augite grains, the latter moulding about and between the\\nformer. There is about 10% of interstitial brown matrix that\\nwas originally mostly glass but is now partly devitrified and car-\\nries microlites of augite and is clouded with magnetite grains.\\nOlivine in grains now altered to a serpentine-like mineral makes\\nup nearly 10% of the rock. The feldspars are partly altered\\nto a mineral that resembles sericite.\\n\\nThe plagioclase laths average about 0.1 mm. in length, the\\nolivine grains about 0.1 mm. in diameter and the augite grains\\na little larger. The serpentine and sericite are hydrous minerals\\nand might lose some of their water even below 100° C.’’\\n\\nThe density at room temperature was 2.924.\\n\\nThe pyrex glass was approximately: S10, 81.35, B.O,\\n11.50, Na,O 4.00; Al,O, 2.1, CaO 0.2, MgO 0.28. The\\ndensity at room temperature was 2.234.\\n\\nThe rock salt was a natural crystal, perfectly clear and\\nflawless. It was machined to shape in the lathe with\\ncutting tools, and I owe it to the skill of Mr. David Mann.\\n\\nResults—The regularity of the readings was not as\\ngreat as that possible to obtain with the liquids. The\\nreason is that the apparatus is best adapted to materials\\nwith low conductivity, and the conductivity of liquids is\\nlower than that of those solids measured here. Never-\\ntheless a degree of accuracy was obtained amply sufficient\\nfor the purpose in hand, and doubtless the accuracy of\\n 88 P. W.

Therefore, the characterization of fault zones is\\nan important step toward performance assessment of a\\nreservoir. The ﬂuid ﬂow is controlled also by pressure and\\ntemperature conditions.\\nIn this context, we simulated\\npressure and temperature ﬁelds to elaborate on the inﬂu-\\nence of permeability on subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow in the\\nLahendong geothermal reservoir.

The best ﬁtting models identiﬁed a\\ndeep-seated fault that has previously not been traced at the\\nsurface. Simulated temperature distribution suggests a\\nprominent convective heat ﬂow, driven by an upward\\nmigrating and SW–NE oriented ﬂuid ﬂow. This hydraulic\\ngradient causes a pressure drop along the reservoir. High-\\npressure patterns are used to constrain recharge areas, in\\naddition to inﬁltration measurements.

The\\nproductivity of a geothermal ﬁeld mainly depends on\\nsubsurface ﬂuid ﬂow, which in active tectonic regions is\\ncontrolled by permeability of fault zones (Moeck 2014). In\\nthat frame, the primary focus is on locating and charac-\\nterizing faulted areas in geothermal ﬁelds. This study\\nemploys numerical modeling to allocate and quantify\\npermeability anisotropies and discontinuities, e.g., faults, in\\norder to understand their inﬂuence on subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow\\nin geothermal reservoirs.\\n\\nNumerical models have been increasingly used to\\nunderstand the setup and productivity of geothermal sys-\\ntems. A general overview of geothermal models has been\\ngiven by O’Sullivan et al. (2001). Additionally, there are\\nseveral sites exemplifying similar characteristics as in\\nLahendong. The underground movement of hot and cold\\nﬂuids has been modeled for geothermal ﬁelds in New\\nZealand (Kaya et al. 2014). The Kakkonda geothermal site,\\ne.g., consists of two reservoirs at various depths with dif-\\nferent ﬂuid properties. There,\\nresults from ﬂuid ﬂow\\nanalysis show the importance of fractures for ﬂuid transport\\nenhancing the recharge or discharge in the reservoir\\n\\n123\\n\\n\\x0c1088 Page 2 of 11\\n\\nEnviron Earth Sci (2016) 75:1088\\n\\n(McGuinness et al. 1995). Generally, faults acting as\\npreferential ﬂuid path ways signiﬁcantly change the pres-\\nsure and temperature ﬁeld in the reservoir (Cherubini et al.\\n2013). Models for the Seferihisar–Balc¸ova ﬁeld focus on\\nthe ﬂuid ﬂow inside of faults. Results show an enhanced\\nupward heat transport through ﬂuids from bottom of the\\ngeothermal system (Magri et al. 2011).\\n\\nOur test ground is the Lahendong geothermal ﬁeld\\nlocated in Sulawesi, Indonesia. The ﬁeld is owned and\\noperated by P.T. Pertamina Geothermal Energy and hosts a\\npower plant with a production capacity of 80 MWe. There,\\ngeothermal exploration started in the early 1970s including\\ngeophysical and geohydrochemical approaches. It\\nis a\\nwater-dominated magmatic structurally controlled system.\\nFaults generally act as across-fault ﬂuid barriers and along-\\nfault ﬂuid conductors (Brehme et al. 2014). As a result, hot\\nsprings mainly appear on the top of vertically permeable\\nfaults at the surface. Available numerous drilling and sur-\\nface measurements allowed a detailed characterization of\\nthe geological and hydrogeological setting of the area\\n(Fig. 1; Brehme et al. 2011, 2013, 2014, 2016; Wiegand\\net al. 2013). The model presented here is developed for\\ninvestigating subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow and the permeability\\ndistribution including the fault zones in the Lahendong\\ngeothermal ﬁeld. Below, the geological structure of the\\n\\nﬁeld is presented followed by an introduction to the mod-\\neling approach.\\n\\nDetailed investigation of subsurface permeability dis-\\ntribution is a crucial step for site selection and smart dril-\\nling strategies. The numerical simulations presented will\\nprovide insight into understanding the subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow\\nconsidering the hydraulic conductivity of faults. It ensures\\nproductive as well as sustainable operation of geothermal\\nﬁelds avoiding risks, such as drilling into non-fractured or\\ncold zones, and targeting highly corroding waters.\\nAlthough the target area is Lahendong, the general work-\\nﬂow is applicable for other geothermal sites consisting of\\nsimilar constraints.\\n\\nReservoir characterization\\n\\nHydrogeology\\n\\nThe overall driving force for the ﬂuid ﬂow is the SW–NE\\noriented natural hydraulic gradient\\nin the Lahendong\\ngeothermal system. The direction of ﬂuid ﬂow varies\\nthrough the geothermal site due to horizontal partitioning\\nof the reservoir by relatively less permeable fault zones\\n(Brehme et al. 2014). The basic sections are located in the\\n\\nFig. 1 Topographic map of the study area with geological features, water and rock sample locations, and model cross section\\n\\n123\\n\\n\\x0cEnviron Earth Sci (2016) 75:1088\\n\\nPage 3 of 11\\n\\n1088\\n\\nsouth, in the east, and beneath Lake Linau. Beneath Lake\\nLinau, the direction of ﬂuid ﬂow is slightly rotated to\\nWSW–ENE (Fig. 1). Also, types of ﬂuid change from one\\nsection to another, e.g., an acidic highly saline-type\\nbeneath Lake Linau and a neutral low saline-type south and\\neast of Lake Linau (Fig. 1). The impermeable structure\\nacross faults prevent the ﬂuids from diluting each other\\n(Brehme et al. 2016). However, faults are rather permeable\\nalong the vertical axis, which allows recharge of the system\\nthrough the faults. Rainwater inﬁltrates at a fault in the SW,\\nat Mt. Lengkoan, and creek water inﬁltrates into the normal\\nfaults at Lake Linau (Fig. 2). The hydrothermal system\\ndischarges into Lake Linau and toward the NE, as driven\\nby the hydraulic gradient (Brehme et al. 2014).\\n\\nThe fracture network along the area is characterized by\\nstrike slip faults and normal faults. The sinistral faults\\nstrike N 40° and steeply dip toward the SE. Left step over\\non the strike slip faults forms an extension basin in the\\ncentral study area. Normal faults at the extension basin\\nstrike NW and dip 70°–80° beneath Lake Linau (Brehme\\net al. 2014).\\n\\nLithology\\n\\nLahendong area is mainly characterized by Pre-, Post- and\\nTondano formation of Plio- to Pleistocene age (Koestono\\net al. 2010). The rocks are typically andesite, volcanic\\nbreccia, and tuff. Those types have been sampled from\\nborehole cores and used to determine porosity, permeabil-\\nity, and thermal conductivity. Effective porosity and matrix\\npermeability have been analyzed using a cylindrical-shaped\\n\\nspecimen with a dimension of 5 cm x 5 cm 9 2.5 cm ori-\\nented parallel to the coring (Brehme et al. 2016). Thermal\\nconductivity has been measured on plain sections of dried\\ncores. The experimental setup consists of a gas perme-\\nameter for determining matrix permeability (Milsch et al.\\n2011), of an helium pycnometry for effective porosity\\nmeasurements (Johnson-Maynard et al. 1994) and of an\\noptical scanner for thermal conductivity measurements\\n(Popov et al. 1999). These parameters have been measured\\nand averaged for the three rock types (Brehme et al. 2016;\\nTable 1). Andesite has an effective porosity of 3.7 %, a\\npermeability of 2.1 9 10-14 m2, and a thermal conductiv-\\nity of 1.8 W m-1 K-1 (dry) or 2.2 W m-1 K-1 (saturated).\\nTuff has a porosity of 7.7 % but the lowest permeability of\\n2.0 9 10-15 m2\\nof\\n1.6 W m-1 K-1\\n(saturated).\\nVolcanic breccia is a permeable layer with an effective\\nporosity of 10.5 %, a permeability of 2.3 9 10-14 m2, and\\na thermal conductivity of 1.6 W m-1 K-1\\n(dry) or\\n2.5 W m-1 K-1 (saturated).

Details on the software and the\\nparameterization can be found in Diersch (2014).\\n\\nThe model geometry is a 2D vertical SW–NE trending\\ncross section extending 6 km in horizontal and 3 km in\\nvertical direction.

Material properties of\\n\\n123\\n\\nelements are permeability, porosity, and thermal conduc-\\ntivity and set according to laboratory measurements\\n(Table 1). However, properties of the faults and Lake\\nLinau are slightly adapted to speciﬁc conditions. The def-\\ninitions for the modeled grids along the faults are as fol-\\nlows: porosity is 30 % and thermal conductivity is\\n1.8 W m-1 K-1. Corresponding grids for Lake Linau are\\ndeﬁned by a porosity of 100 % and a thermal conductivity\\nof 0.6 W m-1 K-1. The model simulates ﬂuid ﬂow and\\nthermal transport in saturated media in steady state.\\n\\nInitial values and boundary conditions\\n\\nFluid ﬂow boundary conditions in the model describe\\ngroundwater heads and recharge amounts (Table 2; Fig. 2).\\nThe hydraulic head at the SW model boundary is 837 m\\nand 500 m at the NE boundary. The SW hydraulic head\\nrepresents inﬁltration of surface water into a fault, striking\\nperpendicular to the model. Hydraulic head at the NE\\nborder is adapted to borehole measurements in that area\\n(Brehme et al. 2014). Inﬁltration into the fault zones at\\nLake Linau is described by ﬂuid ﬂux boundary conditions.\\nThe quantity is 3.0 9 10-4 m s-1\\nthe SW and\\n1.3 9 10-6 m s-1 at the NE fault distributed over 40 m\\nfault width. Groundwater recharge is set to 412 mm a-1 at\\nthe NE top surface (Table 2; Fig. 2). Fluid movement in\\n\\nfor\\n\\n\\x0cthe model domain is constrained by no-ﬂow boundary at\\nthe bottom, recharge through the surrounding fault zones,\\nand the low hydraulic heads in the NE model area. Dis-\\ncharge of the system in the central study area is mainly\\ntoward Lake Linau and across the NE model boundary.\\nInitial hydraulic head for the whole model domain is\\n500 m.\\n\\nThe heat\\n\\nis 116 °C km-1 at\\n\\ntransport boundary conditions are time-in-\\nvariant, ﬁxed temperatures, and heat ﬂux (Table 2; Fig. 2).\\nThermal gradient\\nthe SW model\\nboundary, and the temperature is constant 350 °C at the\\npluton. Temperature of water inﬁltrating into faults and\\nhere mixing with shallow warm groundwater is 70 °C,\\nwhile surface groundwater recharge is at 28 °C. Temper-\\nature values are obtained from ﬁeld and bore log mea-\\nsurements (Brehme et al. 2014). Heat ﬂux is set\\nto\\n100 mW m-2 at\\nthe bottom model boundary (Table 2;\\nFig. 2). This value is ﬁxed based on the studies from\\nDelisle et al. (1998), Nagao and Uyeda (1995), and Neben\\net al. (1998). Initial temperature for the model domain is\\nset as 116 °C km-1, according to the local\\nthermal\\ngradient.\\n\\nPermeability determination\\n\\nInitial values for permeability are deﬁned based on labo-\\nratory measurements (Table 1). After each simulation run,\\nmodeled and measured temperature and pressure values\\nhave been compared at indicated observation points. In\\ncase of poor matching (errors [10 %), permeability has\\nbeen adjusted until satisfactory results have been achieved.\\nBeneath lake Linau, simulation results showed locally\\nstrong discrepancies between modeled and measured\\npressure and temperature (errors [45 %). Adjustment of\\npermeability in geological\\ninﬁltration rates into\\nfaults, or hydraulic heads did not lead to acceptable results.\\nOnly the implementation of strong permeability anisotropy\\nthroughout whole depth, i.e., an additional fault, resulted in\\nminimization of errors (0–7 %). Implementation has been\\naccomplished by mesh adaptation to ensure appropriate\\nbehavior around the fault. By this procedure, permeability\\nanisotropies have been located and characterized in detail\\nthroughout the model.\\n\\nlayers,\\n\\nIn general, deﬁning a direction-dependent permeability\\nimproves the data ﬁt rather than using similar permeabili-\\nties in all directions. This is probably due to the fractures\\nincreasing the permeability mostly in vertical direction.\\n\\nPorosity and thermal conductivity remained constant\\nthroughout simulation. Variation in porosity is negligible\\nbecause it would directly be reﬂected in permeability,\\nwhile thermal conductivity differences would only affect\\nconductive heat transport, which is not dominant in the\\nLahendong area (Ondrak et al. 1998; Brehme et al. 2014).\\n\\n123\\n\\n100c\\n\\nmeasurementa\\n\\n500borelog\\n\\nofmodel\\nBottom\\n\\nboundary\\nNEmodel\\n\\ncDelisleetal.(1998),NagaoandUyeda(1995),Nebenetal.(1998)\\nbDWD(2007),Ho¨ltingandColdewey(2005),Saghravanietal.(2013)\\naBrehmeetal.(2014)\\n\\nSeeTable1\\n\\nMaterialproperties\\n\\nHeatﬂux(mWm-2)\\n\\n28ﬁeldmeasurementa\\n\\n70estimationa\\n\\nmeasurementa\\n\\n350borelog\\n\\n1.3x10-8calculationb\\n\\nmeasurementa\\n1.3x10-4ﬁeld\\n\\nlogmeasurementa\\n116°Ckm-1bore\\n\\n70estimationa\\n\\nmeasurementa\\n3.0x10-4ﬁeld\\n\\nelevationa\\n767surface\\n\\nmeasurementa\\n\\n837borelog\\n\\nNEmodelsurface\\n\\nNEfault\\n\\nCoolingpluton\\n\\nLake\\n\\nSWfault\\n\\nSWmodelboundary\\n\\nTemperature(°C)\\n\\nHeattransport\\n\\nFluidﬂux(ms-1)\\n\\nHydraulichead(m)\\n\\nFluidﬂow\\n\\ncondition\\nTypeofBoundary\\n\\nTable2Boundaryconditionspeciﬁcationsandrespectivereferencesofdatabase\\n\\nEnviron Earth Sci (2016) 75:1088\\n\\nPage 5 of 11\\n\\n1088\\n\\n\\x0c1088 Page 6 of 11\\n\\nResults\\n\\nNumerical simulation is performed to obtain the best ﬁt to\\nthe measured data changing the absolute and relative\\npermeability in geological elements. Relative permeability\\nrefers to different permeabilities in horizontal and vertical\\ndirection. As a main result, a blind fault has been rec-\\nognized beneath Lake Linau, which has not been known\\nfrom former studies. Simulated pressure and temperature\\nare measured at ﬁve selected observation points, which\\nrepresent boreholes with available bore logs for pressure\\nand temperature. Details on data are given in Fig. 6. The\\nmodel with best data ﬁt, out of 370 different models, is\\nconsidered to generate the ﬁnal model developed for\\nLahendong.\\n\\nPermeability distribution and identiﬁcation\\nof a blind fault\\n\\nDistribution of permeability patterns in the reservoir has\\nbeen conceived comparing temperature and pressure data\\nin several wells. Especially beneath Lake Linau, closely\\nlocated wells show high variations in temperature and\\npressure. A drop of 100 °C and 18 bar along 300 m dis-\\ntance has been observed between well LHD 24 and\\nLHD 28. Models ﬁrst showed high discrepancies between\\nmodeled and measured values in this area. However, after\\nimplementing another high anisotropic permeable structure\\nbetween the observation points, models resulted in satis-\\nfactory results. The structure has ten times higher vertical\\n\\nEnviron Earth Sci (2016) 75:1088\\n\\npermeability than horizontal permeability. This structure is\\nassumed to be another fault zone located between two\\nknown faults with vertical dip and NW strike. This fault\\nshows no trace at surface, because it is covered by Lake\\nLinau.\\n\\nGenerally, modeled permeability distribution in the\\nLahendong reservoir is direction-dependent and overprints\\nthe lithology. Modeled permeability is generally higher\\nthan measured ones in the order of up to four magnitudes.\\nThis is due to fracture patterns, which are not detectable at\\ncore-sample scale. Permeability patterns directly affect\\nsubsurface ﬂuid ﬂow and temperature and pressure\\ndistribution.\\n\\nPermeability in the faulted zones and surroundings is\\nlowest in the study area. Especially the middle and NE\\nfault, the shallow area beneath SW Lake Linau and the\\ndeep NE section of the NE fault show low permeabilities\\nbetween 10-13 and 10-14 m2 (Fig. 3). The area between\\nthe middle and NE fault, the deep section NE of the SW\\nfault, the SW fault itself and the whole model area toward\\nthe SW and NE boundary show higher permeabilities of\\n10-10 and 10-12 m2 (Fig. 3).\\n\\nPermeability varies not only within the modeled area,\\nbut also in vertical and horizontal direction. In faults and\\nthe deep reservoir section in the NE, permeability is by a\\nfactor of 10 higher in the vertical direction than in the\\nhorizontal direction (Fig. 3). In the areas between faults,\\npermeability is in some parts by a factor of 10–100 lower in\\nthe vertical direction. In the rest of the model, vertical and\\nhorizontal permeability do not differ (Fig. 3).\\n\\nFig. 3 Final adapted permeability and anisotropy distribution throughout the model domain.

Isobars drop following the\\nnatural hydraulic gradient from SW to NE. The SW section\\nof the system shows higher pressures, which is caused by\\ninﬁltration from higher elevations in the SW. Some wells\\nexisting in this region are of artesian-type. Overpressure\\nreleases through high permeable zones beneath Lake Linau\\nand discharges toward surface. The pressure drop is up to\\n20 bars across the faults (Fig. 4).\\n\\nTemperature distribution\\n\\nTemperature distribution along the Lahendong geothermal\\nreservoir suggests that convective heat transport\\nis the\\ndominating process in the reservoir rocks. Isotherms gen-\\nerally follow the SW–NE oriented ﬂow pattern, the rise and\\nthe inﬁltration of ﬂuids. Upwelling of isotherms between\\nthe faults veriﬁes water rise toward Lake Linau. Inﬁltration\\nof cold water causes down welling of isotherms particu-\\nlarly on the northeast section of the model. Temperature is\\nlocally increased at the bottom of the model surrounding\\nthe pluton (Fig. 4).\\n\\nSubsurface ﬂuid ﬂow\\n\\nThe absolute and horizontal/vertical permeability distri-\\nbution controls local ﬂuid ﬂow in the Lahendong reservoir.\\n\\nThe general ﬂuid ﬂow, driven by the natural pressure\\ngradient, is oriented from SW to NE. Vertical inﬁltration\\noccurs at faults at Lake Linau and at the SW boundary.\\nDischarge is across the NE model boundary (Fig. 5). The\\nmore detailed ﬂow patterns can be observed with stream-\\nlines, which show a ﬂuid ﬂow along highly permeable\\nareas. Calculated streamlines describe particle ﬂow within\\nthe model domain. A forward calculation shows how\\ninﬁltrating water at the SW model boundary distributes\\nthrough the reservoir. The backward calculation shows the\\nsource of ﬂuid particles arriving at the NE model boundary\\n(Fig. 5). Patterns show that hot groundwater ﬂows toward\\nthe faults beneath Lake Linau, where the ﬂuid ﬂow is\\ndisturbed by a rise in temperature and vertically high per-\\nmeable layers. This causes a rise of groundwater in this\\nmodel area (red forward streamlines in Fig. 5). At the same\\ntime, cold water inﬁltrates into high permeable areas and\\ndistributes over the NE model domain (blue backward\\nstreamlines in Fig. 5). It is clearly seen that the composi-\\ntion of the NE reservoir domain is dominated by coldwater\\ninﬁltration into faults, while the production areas are\\ncharacterized by hot water ﬂow (Fig. 5).\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\nInvestigation of\\nsubsurface ﬂuid ﬂow in geothermal\\nreservoirs is crucial for sustainable exploitation avoiding\\ndrilling into less productive areas.

The inﬂuence of these\\nparameters on the ﬂuid ﬂow has been investigated in\\nLahendong geothermal reservoir using hydraulic–thermal\\nsimulations. Simulation results show the detailed perme-\\nability distribution in the reservoir including location of an\\nadditional fault zone.\\n\\nMatching of measured and simulated temperature and\\npressure has been used as a tool for resolving the perme-\\nability distribution. Temperature and pressure have been\\niteratively determined at\\nseveral observation points\\n(Fig. 2). Generally, modeled values are in good agreement\\nwith observed ones (Fig. 6). Nevertheless, some observa-\\ntion points give slightly different values for both pressure\\nand temperature (LHD 4 and LHD 7) or only temperature\\n(LHD 24). This is probably due to the complicated ﬂow\\nprocesses or strong small-scale structural variation in\\nfractured and faulted areas. Furthermore, density varia-\\ntions, which could have not been included into simulation\\ndue to high temperatures, could cause variation of ﬂuid\\npressure. However,\\nthe average deviation of simulated\\npressure and temperature is 1 %.\\n\\nImplemented model parameters are porosity, perme-\\nability, and heat conductivity. From those parameters, only\\npermeability has been tested in a speciﬁc range during\\nsimulation. The inﬂuence of porosity and heat conductivity\\non ﬂuid ﬂow is negligible due to dominating convective\\nheat ﬂow (Ondrak et al. 1998). Values implemented in the\\nmodel are based on measured permeabilities, which rep-\\nresent matrix permeability of rocks.\\n\\nThe measured matrix permeability, representing per-\\nmeability in horizontal direction, is 1.5 9 10-14 m2 on\\n\\n123\\n\\naverage, which remains within typical permeability range\\nfor fractured igneous rocks (Scho¨n 2004). Permeability for\\nvolcanic breccias ranges typically between 3 9 10-15 and\\n5 9 10-12 m2 and tuff permeabilities\\nrange between\\n7 9 10-17 and 7 9 10-12 m2 (Klavetter and Peters 1987).\\nIn the Wairakei geothermal ﬁeld, simulating the imper-\\nmeable layers resulted in permeabilities of 10-18 and\\n10-14 m2,\\nin horizontal and vertical axis, respectively\\n(Mercer and Faust 1979).\\n\\nHowever, permeability in reservoir rocks might be\\nlocally increased due to fracture formation. It might also be\\ndecreased due to alteration and sealing in faults.\\nIn\\nLahendong, modeled permeability can be up to four mag-\\nnitudes higher than measured ones in faulted areas. This is\\ncaused by fractures, which are not detectable in core scale.\\nMoreover, in fault cores, it is by a factor of 10 higher in\\nvertical direction than in horizontal direction. However, in\\nareas between faults (fault gauge), permeability is in some\\nparts by a factor of 10–100 lower in the vertical direction.\\nAdaptation of permeability ensures a ﬁt to measured tem-\\nperature and pressure data.\\n\\nPermeability in fractured areas is the main factor inﬂu-\\nencing subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow and temperature distribution in\\nthe Lahendong reservoir area. Subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow is\\ndriven by local hydraulic heads, which show high varia-\\ntions at different sections of the study area. Consequently,\\nconvective heat distribution leads to high temperature\\nvariation along the reservoir. These phenomena are\\nobserved in Lahendong as well as comparable ﬁelds.

Well speciﬁcations and measured data from Brehme\\net al. (2014)\\n\\ntemperature drops and upwelling of isotherms indicate that\\nfault zones control the ﬂuid ﬂow in the Lake Long and\\nValentine ﬁelds, USA (Hooper 1991). The analysis of ﬂuid\\npressure differences at\\nthe Alpine fault, New Zealand,\\nallowed to characterize the change in permeability between\\nhanging and footwall blocks (Sutherland et al. 2012).\\n\\nIn summary, high pressure or temperature gradients are\\nindicators for ﬂuid barriers between observation points. In\\nother words, reservoir sections of different properties are\\nseparated by horizontally less permeable faults. In Lahen-\\ndong, most signiﬁcant ﬂuid barriers are faults to the SW\\nand to the NE of Lake Linau. Across these barriers, the\\npressure drops up to 20 bars. A similar pattern has been\\nmeasured in bore logs beneath Lake Linau, where no sur-\\nface trace of a fault had been observed in former studies.\\nHowever, only by implementing another fault, modeled\\nand measured values could have been adapted. The\\nrecently identiﬁed fault zone beneath Lake Linau remains\\nunder lake water and therefore is only traceable by this\\nkind of reservoir modeling.\\n\\nAdditionally to fault identiﬁcation, the internal structure\\nof known fault zones has been understood in detail. The NE\\nfault,\\ni.e., shows a displacement at 2 km depth. The\\ndetailed trend has been understood by permeability adap-\\ntation in this area.\\n\\nDue to low permeability in horizontal direction in the\\nfaults, ﬂuids propagate mostly vertically toward the hot\\nsprings at surface. It also allows surface water to inﬁltrate\\ninto the reservoir in case the pressure within the fault zone\\nis low enough (Fig. 5). This vertical ﬂuid movement\\n\\neventually controls the temperature distribution in the\\nreservoir. Upward migration of deep hot water increases\\nthe temperature, while inﬁltration of cold surface water\\ncauses local drop of temperature.\\n\\nIn summary, the most important factors inﬂuencing the\\nreliability of numerical reservoir models are absolute and\\ndifferent horizontal and vertical permeability. However, a\\npermeability adaptation has been done for each geological\\nlayer; the vertical permeability anomalies are overprinting\\nthose layers and are constraining the regional groundwater\\nﬂow. Those permeabilities of fractures directly inﬂuence\\nthe productivity of the reservoir (Cherubini et al. 2013).\\nTherefore,\\ntheir permeability characteristics should be\\ninvestigated in detail.\\n\\nIn a previous study, a numerical model for the Lahen-\\ndong site has been set up in TOUGH2 and aimed at fore-\\ncasting the reservoir behavior during exploitation until the\\nyear 2036. With a production of 60 MWe, it predicts a\\npressure drop of 10 bars. However, the forecast results are\\nuncertain due to lack of measured pressure draw down data\\n(Yani 2006). Accordingly, the next steps of the presented\\nstudy should include a realistic production and injection\\nscenario in order\\nreservoir\\nexploitation. Furthermore, chemical characteristics could\\nbe considered to achieve reliable production setups,\\nbecause hydrochemical processes play an important role in\\nthe Lahendong reservoir (Brehme et al. 2016).

This characteristic is used to simu-\\nlate different reservoir sections, and vertical ﬂuid rise\\ntoward the surface. By stepwise adaptation of permeability\\nﬁelds, based on observed temperature and pressure gradi-\\nents, an additional blind fault zone can be identiﬁed\\nbeneath Lake Linau. Temperature and pressure signiﬁ-\\ncantly drop across that ﬂuid barrier. This behavior has been\\nobserved in comparable ﬁelds in the USA as well. The\\noverall shape of ﬂuid ﬂow direction trends in a SW–NE\\ndirection. Main recharge occurs by inﬁltration of surface\\nwater into the faults, especially in the southwest and near to\\nLake Linau. Discharge is enhanced in highly fractured\\nareas toward Lake Linau. Vertical permeability of faults\\nallows ﬂuids rising toward the hot springs at surface.\\n\\nResults show that permeability has to be considered for\\nsimulation of a geothermal system.

to another, e.g., an acidic highly saline-type\\nbeneath lake linau and a neutral low saline-type south and\\neast of lake linau (fig. 1). the impermeable structure\\nacross faults prevent the ﬂuids from diluting each other\\n(brehme et al. 2016). however, faults are rather permeable\\nalong the vertical axis, which allows recharge of the system\\nthrough the faults. rainwater inﬁltrates at a fault in the sw,\\nat mt. lengkoan, and creek water inﬁltrates into the normal\\nfaults at lake linau (fig. 2). the hydrothermal system\\ndischarges into lake linau and toward the ne, as driven\\nby the hydraulic gradient (brehme et al. 2014).\\n\\nthe fracture network along the area is characterized by\\nstrike slip faults and normal faults. the sinistral faults\\nstrike n 40° and steeply dip

andesite, volcanic\\nbreccia, and tuff. those types have been sampled from\\nborehole cores and used to determine porosity, permeability, and thermal conductivity. effective porosity and matrix\\npermeability have been analyzed using a cylindrical-shaped\\n\\nspecimen with a dimension of 5 cm x 5 cm 9 2.5 cm oriented parallel to the coring (brehme et al. 2016). thermal\\nconductivity has been measured on plain sections of dried\\ncores. the experimental setup consists of a gas permeameter for determining matrix permeability (milsch et al.\\n2011), of an helium pycnometry for

(2001). additionally, there are several sites exemplifying similar characteristics as in lahendong. the underground movement of hot and cold ﬂuids has been modeled for geothermal ﬁelds in new zealand (kaya et al. 2014). the kakkonda geothermal site, e.g., consists of two reservoirs at various depths with different ﬂuid properties. there, results from ﬂuid ﬂow analysis show the importance of fractures for ﬂuid transport enhancing the recharge or discharge in the reservoir  123  \\x0c1088 page 2 of 11  environ earth sci (2016) 75:1088  (mcguinness et al. 1995). generally, faults acting as preferential ﬂuid path ways signiﬁcantly change the pressure and temperature ﬁeld in the reservoir (cherubini et al. 2013). models for the seferihisar–balc¸ova ﬁeld focus on the ﬂuid ﬂow inside of faults. results show an enhanced upward heat transport through ﬂuids from bottom of the geothermal system (magri et al. 2011).  our test ground is the lahendong geothermal ﬁeld located in sulawesi, indonesia. the ﬁeld is owned and operated by p.t. pertamina geothermal energy and hosts a power plant with a production capacity of 80 mwe. there, geothermal exploration started in the early 1970s including geophysical and geohydrochemical approaches. it is a water-dominated magmatic structurally controlled system. faults generally act as across-fault ﬂuid barriers and alongfault ﬂuid conductors (brehme et al. 2014). as a result, hot springs mainly appear on the top of vertically permeable faults at the surface. available numerous drilling and surface measurements allowed a detailed characterization of the geological and hydrogeological setting of the area (fig. 1; brehme et al. 2011, 2013, 2014, 2016; wiegand et al. 2013). the model presented here is developed for investigating subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow and the permeability distribution including the fault zones in the lahendong geothermal ﬁeld. below, the geological structure of the  ﬁeld is presented followed by an introduction to the modeling approach.  detailed investigation of subsurface permeability distribution is a crucial step for site selection and smart drilling strategies. the numerical simulations presented will provide insight into understanding the subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow considering the hydraulic conductivity of faults. it ensures productive as well as sustainable operation of geothermal ﬁelds avoiding risks, such as drilling into non-fractured or cold zones, and targeting highly corroding waters. although the target area is lahendong, the general workﬂow is applicable for other geothermal sites consisting of similar constraints.  reservoir characterization  hydrogeology  the overall driving force for the ﬂuid ﬂow is the sw–ne oriented natural hydraulic gradient in the lahendong geothermal system. the direction of ﬂuid ﬂow varies through the geothermal site due to horizontal partitioning of the reservoir by relatively less permeable fault zones (brehme et al. 2014). the basic sections are located in the  fig. 1 topographic map of the study area with geological features, water and rock sample locations, and model cross section  123  \\x0cenviron earth sci (2016) 75:1088  page 3 of 11  1088  south, in the east, and beneath lake linau. beneath lake linau, the direction of ﬂuid ﬂow is slightly rotated to wsw–ene (fig. 1). also, types of ﬂuid change from one section to another, e.g., an acidic highly saline-type beneath lake linau and a neutral low saline-type south and east of lake linau (fig. 1). the impermeable structure across faults prevent the ﬂuids from diluting each other (brehme et al. 2016). however, faults are rather permeable along the vertical axis, which allows recharge of the system through the faults. rainwater inﬁltrates at a fault in the sw, at mt. lengkoan, and creek water inﬁltrates into the normal faults at lake linau (fig. 2). the hydrothermal system discharges into lake linau and toward the ne, as driven by the hydraulic gradient (brehme et al. 2014).  the fracture network along the area is characterized by strike slip faults and normal faults. the sinistral faults strike n 40° and steeply dip toward the se. left step over on the strike slip faults forms an extension basin in the central study area. normal faults at the extension basin strike nw and dip 70°–80° beneath lake linau (brehme et al. 2014).  lithology  lahendong area is mainly characterized by pre-, postand tondano formation of plioto pleistocene age (koestono et al. 2010). the rocks are typically andesite, volcanic breccia, and tuff. those types have been sampled from borehole cores and used to determine porosity, permeability, and thermal conductivity. effective porosity and matrix permeability have been analyzed using a cylindrical-shaped  specimen with a dimension of 5 cm x 5 cm 9 2.5 cm oriented parallel to the coring (brehme et al. 2016). thermal conductivity has been measured on plain sections of dried cores. the experimental setup consists of a gas permeameter for determining matrix permeability (milsch et al. 2011), of an helium pycnometry for effective porosity measurements (johnson-maynard et al. 1994) and of an optical scanner for thermal conductivity measurements (popov et al. 1999). these parameters have been measured and averaged for the three rock types (brehme et al. 2016; table 1). andesite has an effective porosity of 3.7 %, a permeability of 2.1 9 10-14 m2, and a thermal conductivity of 1.8 w m-1 k-1 (dry) or 2.2 w m-1 k-1 (saturated). tuff has a porosity of 7.7 % but the lowest permeability of 2.0 9 10-15 m2 of 1.6 w m-1 k-1 (saturated). volcanic breccia is a permeable layer with an effective porosity of 10.5 %, a permeability of 2.3 9 10-14 m2, and a thermal conductivity of 1.6 w m-1 k-1 (dry) or 2.5 w m-1 k-1 (saturated). reservoir rocks reﬂect generally low matrix permeability suggesting fracture-controlled ﬂuid ﬂow throughout the aquifer (brehme et al. 2016).  and (dry) or 2.1 w m-1 k-1  a  thermal  conductivity  model setup  model geometry  numerical models developed for the study area represent the initial conditions of the reservoir before production or the commercial ﬁnite injection start. for simulation,  fig. 2 cross section of the modeled area with geological structure, boundary conditions, and location of observation points  123  \\x0c1088 page 4 of 11  environ earth sci (2016) 75:1088  table 1 thermal and hydraulic parameters of the lahendong reservoir rocks measured in laboratory (brehme et al. 2016)  sample (name, depth)  rock type  effective porosity (%)  thermal conductivity dry (w m-1 k-1)  thermal conductivity saturated (w m-1 k-1)  matrix permeability (m2)  lhd1 500–501  lhd1 801–802  lhd1 1000–1001  lhd1 2100–2101  lhd2 300–302  lhd3 2201–2203  lhd4 652–653  lhd4 850–852  lhd4 1001–1002  lhd4 2304–2305  lhd5 602–603  lhd5 752–753  lhd5 1102–1103  lhd5 1404–1406  lhd5 1575–1576  lhd7 901–902,3  lhd7 1567.8–1568  lhd7 1756–1758  average values  a  b  t  t  a  b  b  a  b  a  b  a  a  a  a  a  t  b  andesite (a)  breccia (b)  tuff (t)  1.1  14.5  5.0  7.2  12.5  5.7  6.3  1.6  16.4  1.6  16.3  2.7  5.2  3.6  0.6  4.6  11.0  3.9  3.7  10.5  7.7  (lhd1 550) 2.0  (lhd1 550) 2.2  1.6  1.8  1.4  2.1  1.8  1.4  1.8  1.4  1.9  1.5  1.6  2.1  1.8  1.6  1.6  2.4  2.2  2.0  2.4  2.0  2.7  2.7  2.3  2.3  1.7  2.2  2.7  2.2  2.5  2.1  1.5 9 10-14 8.9 9 10-16 3.3 9 10-15 6.1 9 10-14 1.5 9 10-14 1.3 9 10-14 2.3 9 10-14 6.8 9 10-14 3.4 9 10-16 1.1 9 10-14 1.1 9 10-16 7.9 9 10-14 3.0 9 10-15 7.9 9 10-18 7.2 9 10-16 1.7 9 10-15 1.7 9 10-14 2.1 9 10-14 2.3 9 10-14 2.0 9 10-15  element software feflow is used to model pressuredriven and thermally induced ﬂuid ﬂow including viscosity changes. governing equations for ﬂuid ﬂow and heat transport in saturated porous media are derived from conservation principles of linear momentum, mass, and energy (dhi-wasy 2009). details on the software and the parameterization can be found in diersch (2014).  the model geometry is a 2d vertical sw–ne trending cross section extending 6 km in horizontal and 3 km in vertical direction. the direction of the proﬁle has been selected to cover all relevant processes in the lahendong geothermal ﬁeld: it cuts major faults and the production and injection wells, which are used for temperature and pressure calibration. furthermore, to the groundwater ﬂow direction, showing major ﬂuid ﬂow activities. the homogeneous and isotropic geological layers in the model are stratiﬁed nearly horizontally. faults in the middle of the model, striking perpendicular to the cross section, dip with 84° toward a cooling pluton beneath lake linau. details on structural and geological components of the modeled region have been presented in brehme et al. (2014).  is parallel  it  the numerical  the mesh used for  simulation in feflow consists of 45,264 nodes and 89,320 elements that are denser surrounding the faults because of expected gradients due to parameter contrasts. material properties of  123  elements are permeability, porosity, and thermal conductivity and set according to laboratory measurements (table 1). however, properties of the faults and lake linau are slightly adapted to speciﬁc conditions. the definitions for the modeled grids along the faults are as follows: porosity is 30 % and thermal conductivity is 1.8 w m-1 k-1. corresponding grids for lake linau are deﬁned by a porosity of 100 % and a thermal conductivity of 0.6 w m-1 k-1. the model simulates ﬂuid ﬂow and thermal transport in saturated media in steady state.  initial values and boundary conditions  fluid ﬂow boundary conditions in the model describe groundwater heads and recharge amounts (table 2; fig. 2). the hydraulic head at the sw model boundary is 837 m and 500 m at the ne boundary. the sw hydraulic head represents inﬁltration of surface water into a fault, striking perpendicular to the model. hydraulic head at the ne border is adapted to borehole measurements in that area (brehme et al. 2014). inﬁltration into the fault zones at lake linau is described by ﬂuid ﬂux boundary conditions. the quantity is 3.0 9 10-4 m s-1 the sw and 1.3 9 10-6 m s-1 at the ne fault distributed over 40 m fault width. groundwater recharge is set to 412 mm a-1 at the ne top surface (table 2; fig. 2). fluid movement in  for  \\x0cthe model domain is constrained by no-ﬂow boundary at the bottom, recharge through the surrounding fault zones, and the low hydraulic heads in the ne model area. discharge of the system in the central study area is mainly toward lake linau and across the ne model boundary. initial hydraulic head for the whole model domain is 500 m.  the heat  is 116 °c km-1 at  transport boundary conditions are time-invariant, ﬁxed temperatures, and heat ﬂux (table 2; fig. 2). thermal gradient the sw model boundary, and the temperature is constant 350 °c at the pluton. temperature of water inﬁltrating into faults and here mixing with shallow warm groundwater is 70 °c, while surface groundwater recharge is at 28 °c. temperature values are obtained from ﬁeld and bore log measurements (brehme et al. 2014). heat ﬂux is set to 100 mw m-2 at the bottom model boundary (table 2; fig. 2). this value is ﬁxed based on the studies from delisle et al. (1998), nagao and uyeda (1995), and neben et al. (1998). initial temperature for the model domain is set as 116 °c km-1, according to the local thermal gradient.  permeability determination  initial values for permeability are deﬁned based on laboratory measurements (table 1). after each simulation run, modeled and measured temperature and pressure values have been compared at indicated observation points. in case of poor matching (errors [10 %), permeability has been adjusted until satisfactory results have been achieved. beneath lake linau, simulation results showed locally strong discrepancies between modeled and measured pressure and temperature (errors [45 %). adjustment of permeability in geological inﬁltration rates into faults, or hydraulic heads did not lead to acceptable results. only the implementation of strong permeability anisotropy throughout whole depth, i.e., an additional fault, resulted in minimization of errors (0–7 %). implementation has been accomplished by mesh adaptation to ensure appropriate behavior around the fault. by this procedure, permeability anisotropies have been located and characterized in detail throughout the model.  layers,  in general, deﬁning a direction-dependent permeability improves the data ﬁt rather than using similar permeabilities in all directions. this is probably due to the fractures increasing the permeability mostly in vertical direction.  porosity and thermal conductivity remained constant throughout simulation. variation in porosity is negligible because it would directly be reﬂected in permeability, while thermal conductivity differences would only affect conductive heat transport, which is not dominant in the lahendong area (ondrak et al. 1998; brehme et al. 2014).  123  100c  measurementa  500borelog  ofmodel bottom  boundary

performed to obtain the best ﬁt to the measured data changing the absolute and relative permeability in geological elements. relative permeability refers to different permeabilities in horizontal and vertical direction. as a main result, a blind fault has been recognized beneath lake linau, which has not been known from former studies. simulated pressure and temperature are measured at ﬁve selected observation points, which represent boreholes with available bore logs for pressure and temperature. details on data are given in fig. 6. the model with best data ﬁt, out of 370 different models, is considered to generate the ﬁnal model developed for lahendong.  permeability distribution and identiﬁcation of a blind fault  distribution of permeability patterns in the reservoir has been conceived comparing temperature and pressure data in several wells. especially beneath lake linau, closely located wells show high variations in temperature and pressure. a drop of 100 °c and 18 bar along 300 m distance has been observed between well lhd 24 and lhd 28. models ﬁrst showed high discrepancies between modeled and measured values in this area. however, after implementing another high anisotropic permeable structure between the observation points, models resulted in satisfactory results. the structure has ten times higher vertical  environ earth sci (2016) 75:1088  permeability than horizontal permeability. this structure is assumed to be another fault zone located between two known faults with vertical dip and nw strike. this fault shows no trace at surface, because it is covered by lake linau.  generally, modeled permeability distribution in the lahendong reservoir is direction-dependent and overprints the lithology. modeled permeability is generally higher than measured ones in the order of up to four magnitudes. this is due to fracture patterns, which are not detectable at core-sample scale. permeability patterns directly affect subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow and temperature and pressure distribution.  permeability in the faulted zones and surroundings is lowest in the study area. especially the middle and ne fault, the shallow area beneath sw lake linau and the deep ne section of the ne fault show low permeabilities between 10-13 and 10-14 m2 (fig. 3). the area between the middle and ne fault, the deep section ne of the sw fault, the sw fault itself and the whole model area toward the sw and ne boundary show higher permeabilities of 10-10 and 10-12 m2 (fig. 3).  permeability varies not only within the modeled area, but also in vertical and horizontal direction. in faults and the deep reservoir section in the ne, permeability is by a factor of 10 higher in the vertical direction than in the horizontal direction (fig. 3). in the areas between faults, permeability is in some parts by a factor of 10–100 lower in the vertical direction. in the rest of the model, vertical and horizontal permeability do not differ (fig. 3).  fig. 3 final

suggests that convective heat transport is the dominating process in the reservoir rocks. isotherms generally follow the sw–ne oriented ﬂow pattern, the rise and the inﬁltration of ﬂuids. upwelling of isotherms between the faults veriﬁes water rise toward lake linau. inﬁltration of cold water causes down welling of isotherms particularly on the northeast section of the model. temperature is locally increased at the bottom of the model surrounding the pluton (fig. 4).  subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow  the absolute and horizontal/vertical permeability distribution controls local ﬂuid ﬂow in the lahendong reservoir.  the general ﬂuid ﬂow, driven by the natural pressure gradient, is oriented from sw to ne. vertical inﬁltration occurs at faults at lake linau and at the sw boundary. discharge is across the ne model boundary (fig. 5). the more detailed ﬂow patterns can be observed with streamlines, which show a ﬂuid ﬂow along highly permeable areas. calculated streamlines describe particle ﬂow within the model domain. a forward calculation shows how inﬁltrating water at the sw model boundary distributes through the reservoir. the backward calculation shows the source of ﬂuid particles arriving at the ne model boundary (fig. 5). patterns show that hot groundwater ﬂows toward the faults beneath lake linau, where the ﬂuid ﬂow is disturbed by a rise in temperature and vertically high permeable layers. this causes a rise of groundwater in this model area (red forward streamlines in fig. 5). at the same time, cold water inﬁltrates into high permeable areas and distributes over the ne model domain (blue backward streamlines in fig. 5). it is clearly seen that the composition of the ne reservoir domain is dominated by coldwater inﬁltration into faults, while the production areas are characterized by hot water ﬂow (fig. 5).  discussion  investigation of subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow in geothermal reservoirs is crucial for sustainable exploitation avoiding drilling into less productive areas. subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow might be locally inﬂuenced by fault zones or physical  123  \\x0c1088 page 8 of 11  environ earth sci (2016) 75:1088  fig. 5 model domain with calculated streamlines, in

water (i.e. viscosity). the inﬂuence of these parameters on the ﬂuid ﬂow has been investigated in lahendong geothermal reservoir using hydraulic–thermal simulations. simulation results show the detailed permeability distribution in the reservoir including location of an additional fault zone.  matching of measured and simulated temperature and pressure has been used as a tool for resolving the permeability distribution. temperature and pressure have been iteratively determined at several observation points (fig. 2). generally, modeled values are in good agreement with observed ones (fig. 6). nevertheless, some observation points give slightly different values for both pressure and temperature (lhd 4 and lhd 7) or only temperature (lhd 24). this is probably due to the complicated ﬂow processes or strong small-scale structural variation in fractured and faulted areas. furthermore, density variations, which could have not been included into simulation due to high temperatures, could cause variation of ﬂuid pressure. however, the average deviation of simulated pressure and temperature is 1 %.  implemented model parameters are porosity, permeability, and heat conductivity. from those parameters, only permeability has been tested in a speciﬁc range during simulation. the inﬂuence of porosity and heat conductivity on ﬂuid ﬂow is negligible due to dominating convective heat ﬂow (ondrak et al. 1998). values implemented in the model are based on measured permeabilities, which represent matrix permeability of rocks.  the measured matrix permeability, representing permeability in horizontal direction, is 1.5 9 10-14 m2 on  123  average, which remains within typical permeability range for fractured igneous rocks (scho¨n 2004). permeability for volcanic breccias ranges typically between 3 9 10-15 and 5 9 10-12 m2 and tuff permeabilities range between 7 9 10-17 and 7 9 10-12 m2 (klavetter and peters 1987). in the wairakei geothermal ﬁeld, simulating the impermeable layers resulted in permeabilities of 10-18 and 10-14 m2, in horizontal and vertical axis, respectively (mercer and faust 1979).  however, permeability in reservoir rocks might be locally increased due to fracture formation. it might also be decreased due to alteration and sealing in faults. in lahendong, modeled permeability can be up to four magnitudes higher than measured ones in faulted areas. this is caused by fractures, which are not detectable in core scale. moreover, in fault cores, it is by a factor of 10 higher in vertical direction than in horizontal direction. however, in areas between faults (fault gauge), permeability is in some parts by a factor of 10–100 lower in the vertical direction. adaptation of permeability ensures a ﬁt to measured temperature and pressure data.  permeability in fractured areas is the main factor inﬂuencing subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow and temperature distribution in the lahendong reservoir area. subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow is driven by local hydraulic heads, which show high variations at different sections of the study area. consequently, convective heat distribution leads to high temperature variation along the reservoir. these phenomena are observed in lahendong as well as comparable ﬁelds. in new mexico, water level drops of 30–100 m are observed across (haneberg 1995). high  several  fault  zones  \\x0c123  environ earth sci (2016)

al. (2014)  temperature drops and upwelling of isotherms indicate that fault zones control the ﬂuid ﬂow in the lake long and valentine ﬁelds, usa (hooper 1991). the analysis of ﬂuid pressure differences at the alpine fault, new zealand, allowed to characterize the change in permeability between hanging and footwall blocks (sutherland et al. 2012).  in summary, high pressure or temperature gradients are indicators for ﬂuid barriers between observation points. in other words, reservoir sections of different properties are separated by horizontally less permeable faults. in lahendong, most signiﬁcant ﬂuid barriers are faults to the sw and to the ne of lake linau. across these barriers, the pressure drops up to 20 bars. a similar pattern has been measured in bore logs beneath lake linau, where no surface trace of a fault had been observed in former studies. however, only by implementing another fault, modeled and measured values could have been adapted. the recently identiﬁed fault zone beneath lake linau remains under lake water and therefore is only traceable by this kind of reservoir modeling.  additionally to fault identiﬁcation, the internal structure of known fault zones has been understood in detail. the ne fault, i.e., shows a displacement at 2 km depth. the detailed trend has been understood by permeability adaptation in this area.  due to low permeability in horizontal direction in the faults, ﬂuids propagate mostly vertically toward the hot springs at surface. it also allows surface water to inﬁltrate into the reservoir in case the pressure within the fault zone is low enough (fig. 5). this vertical ﬂuid movement  eventually controls the temperature distribution in the reservoir. upward migration of deep hot water increases the temperature, while inﬁltration of cold surface water causes local drop of temperature.  in summary, the most important factors inﬂuencing the reliability of numerical reservoir models are absolute and different horizontal and vertical permeability. however, a permeability adaptation has been done for each geological layer; the vertical permeability anomalies are overprinting those layers and are constraining the regional groundwater ﬂow. those permeabilities of fractures directly inﬂuence the productivity of the reservoir (cherubini et al. 2013). therefore, their permeability characteristics should be investigated in detail.  in a previous study, a numerical model for the lahendong site has been set up in tough2 and aimed at forecasting the reservoir behavior during exploitation until the year 2036. with a production of 60 mwe, it predicts a pressure drop of 10 bars. however, the forecast results are uncertain due to lack of measured pressure draw down data (yani 2006). accordingly, the next steps of the presented study should include a realistic production and injection scenario in order reservoir exploitation. furthermore, chemical characteristics could be considered to achieve reliable production setups, because hydrochemical processes play an important role in the lahendong reservoir (brehme et al. 2016). presented models from this study provide important information on ﬂuid ﬂow in the water-dominated lahendong reservoir. however, additional the  two-phase ﬂow models of  to support  sustainable  \\x0c1088 page 10 of 11  environ earth sci (2016) 75:1088  lahendong area are in progress to understand the inﬂuence of steam driven ﬂuid ﬂow in this high-temperature system.  conclusion  the primary focus of this study is to understand the inﬂuence of fault zones and permeability patterns on subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow in geothermal reservoirs. the ﬂuid ﬂow mainly depends on rock and fault zone permeability. these processes have been considered in numerical models, which simulate local temperature and pressure conditions. the initial reservoir conditions, which refers to the case before production starts. models are developed based on the conceptual models of the

pressure signiﬁcantly drop across that ﬂuid barrier. this behavior has been observed in comparable ﬁelds in the usa as well. the overall shape of ﬂuid ﬂow direction trends in a sw–ne direction. main recharge occurs by inﬁltration of surface water into the faults, especially in the southwest and near to lake linau. discharge is enhanced in highly fractured areas toward lake linau. vertical permeability of faults allows ﬂuids rising toward the hot springs at surface.  results show that permeability has to be considered for simulation of a geothermal system. the geothermal system is mainly controlled by ﬂuid ﬂow in fractures/faults depending on temperature and pressure conditions. the locally modiﬁed ﬂuid ﬂow can considerably inﬂuence the productivity of a geothermal ﬁeld. results also guide reservoir management in case of a potential for ﬁeld extension, as performed in lahendong.  acknowledgments the authors acknowledge the continuous support within the team of the

(2001). additionally, there are several sites exemplifying similar characteristics as in lahendong. the underground movement of hot and cold ﬂuids has been modeled for geothermal ﬁelds in new zealand (kaya et al. 2014). the kakkonda geothermal site, e.g., consists of two reservoirs at various depths with different ﬂuid properties. there, results from ﬂuid ﬂow analysis show the importance of fractures for ﬂuid transport enhancing the recharge or discharge in the reservoir  123  \\x0c1088 page 2 of 11  environ earth sci (2016) 75:1088  (mcguinness et al. 1995). generally, faults acting as preferential ﬂuid path ways signiﬁcantly change the pressure and temperature ﬁeld in the reservoir (cherubini et al. 2013). models for the seferihisar–balc¸ova ﬁeld focus on the ﬂuid ﬂow inside of faults. results show an enhanced upward heat transport through ﬂuids from bottom of the geothermal system (magri et al. 2011).  our test ground is the lahendong geothermal ﬁeld located in sulawesi, indonesia. the ﬁeld is owned and operated by p.t. pertamina geothermal energy and hosts a power plant with a production capacity of 80 mwe. there, geothermal exploration started in the early 1970s including geophysical and geohydrochemical approaches. it is a water-dominated magmatic structurally controlled system. faults generally act as across-fault ﬂuid barriers and alongfault ﬂuid conductors (brehme et al. 2014). as a result, hot springs mainly appear on the top of vertically permeable faults at the surface. available numerous drilling and surface measurements allowed a detailed characterization of the geological and hydrogeological setting of the area (fig. 1; brehme et al. 2011, 2013, 2014, 2016; wiegand et al. 2013). the model presented here is developed for investigating subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow and the permeability distribution including the fault zones in the lahendong geothermal ﬁeld. below, the geological structure of the  ﬁeld is presented followed by an introduction to the modeling approach.  detailed investigation of subsurface permeability distribution is a crucial step for site selection and smart drilling strategies. the numerical simulations presented will provide insight into understanding the subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow considering the hydraulic conductivity of faults. it ensures productive as well as sustainable operation of geothermal ﬁelds avoiding risks, such as drilling into non-fractured or cold zones, and targeting highly corroding waters. although the target area is lahendong, the general workﬂow is applicable for other geothermal sites consisting of similar constraints.  reservoir characterization  hydrogeology  the overall driving force for the ﬂuid ﬂow is the sw–ne oriented natural hydraulic gradient in the lahendong geothermal system. the direction of ﬂuid ﬂow varies through the geothermal site due to horizontal partitioning of the reservoir by relatively less permeable fault zones (brehme et al. 2014). the basic sections are located in the  fig. 1 topographic map of the study area with geological features, water and rock sample locations, and model cross section  123  \\x0cenviron earth sci (2016) 75:1088  page 3 of 11  1088  south, in the east, and beneath lake linau. beneath lake linau, the direction of ﬂuid ﬂow is slightly rotated to wsw–ene (fig. 1). also, types of ﬂuid change from one section to another, e.g., an acidic highly saline-type beneath lake linau and a neutral low saline-type south and east of lake linau (fig. 1). the impermeable structure across faults prevent the ﬂuids from diluting each other (brehme et al. 2016). however, faults are rather permeable along the vertical axis, which allows recharge of the system through the faults. rainwater inﬁltrates at a fault in the sw, at mt. lengkoan, and creek water inﬁltrates into the normal faults at lake linau (fig. 2). the hydrothermal system discharges into lake linau and toward the ne, as driven by the hydraulic gradient (brehme et al. 2014).  the fracture network along the area is characterized by strike slip faults and normal faults. the sinistral faults strike n 40° and steeply dip toward the se. left step over on the strike slip faults forms an extension basin in the central study area. normal faults at the extension basin strike nw and dip 70°–80° beneath lake linau (brehme et al. 2014).  lithology  lahendong area is mainly characterized by pre-, postand tondano formation of plioto pleistocene age (koestono et al. 2010). the rocks are typically andesite, volcanic breccia, and tuff. those types have been sampled from borehole cores and used to determine porosity, permeability, and thermal conductivity. effective porosity and matrix permeability have been analyzed using a cylindrical-shaped  specimen with a dimension of 5 cm x 5 cm 9 2.5 cm oriented parallel to the coring (brehme et al. 2016). thermal conductivity has been measured on plain sections of dried cores. the experimental setup consists of a gas permeameter for determining matrix permeability (milsch et al. 2011), of an helium pycnometry for effective porosity measurements (johnson-maynard et al. 1994) and of an optical scanner for thermal conductivity measurements (popov et al. 1999). these parameters have been measured and averaged for the three rock types (brehme et al. 2016; table 1). andesite has an effective porosity of 3.7 %, a permeability of 2.1 9 10-14 m2, and a thermal conductivity of 1.8 w m-1 k-1 (dry) or 2.2 w m-1 k-1 (saturated). tuff has a porosity of 7.7 % but the lowest permeability of 2.0 9 10-15 m2 of 1.6 w m-1 k-1 (saturated). volcanic breccia is a permeable layer with an effective porosity of 10.5 %, a permeability of 2.3 9 10-14 m2, and a thermal conductivity of 1.6 w m-1 k-1 (dry) or 2.5 w m-1 k-1 (saturated). reservoir rocks reﬂect generally low matrix permeability suggesting fracture-controlled ﬂuid ﬂow throughout the aquifer (brehme et al. 2016).  and (dry) or 2.1 w m-1 k-1  a  thermal  conductivity  model setup  model geometry  numerical models developed for the study area represent the initial conditions of the reservoir before production or the commercial ﬁnite injection start. for simulation,  fig. 2 cross section of the modeled area with geological structure, boundary conditions, and location of observation points  123  \\x0c1088 page 4 of 11  environ earth sci (2016) 75:1088  table 1 thermal and hydraulic parameters of the lahendong reservoir rocks measured in laboratory (brehme et al. 2016)  sample (name, depth)  rock type  effective porosity (%)  thermal conductivity dry (w m-1 k-1)  thermal conductivity saturated (w m-1 k-1)  matrix permeability (m2)  lhd1 500–501  lhd1 801–802  lhd1 1000–1001  lhd1 2100–2101  lhd2 300–302  lhd3 2201–2203  lhd4 652–653  lhd4 850–852  lhd4 1001–1002  lhd4 2304–2305  lhd5 602–603  lhd5 752–753  lhd5 1102–1103  lhd5 1404–1406  lhd5 1575–1576  lhd7 901–902,3  lhd7 1567.8–1568  lhd7 1756–1758  average values  a  b  t  t  a  b  b  a  b  a  b  a  a  a  a  a  t  b  andesite (a)  breccia (b)  tuff (t)  1.1  14.5  5.0  7.2  12.5  5.7  6.3  1.6  16.4  1.6  16.3  2.7  5.2  3.6  0.6  4.6  11.0  3.9  3.7  10.5  7.7  (lhd1 550) 2.0  (lhd1 550) 2.2  1.6  1.8  1.4  2.1  1.8  1.4  1.8  1.4  1.9  1.5  1.6  2.1  1.8  1.6  1.6  2.4  2.2  2.0  2.4  2.0  2.7  2.7  2.3  2.3  1.7  2.2  2.7  2.2  2.5  2.1  1.5 9 10-14 8.9 9 10-16 3.3 9 10-15 6.1 9 10-14 1.5 9 10-14 1.3 9 10-14 2.3 9 10-14 6.8 9 10-14 3.4 9 10-16 1.1 9 10-14 1.1 9 10-16 7.9 9 10-14 3.0 9 10-15 7.9 9 10-18 7.2 9 10-16 1.7 9 10-15 1.7 9 10-14 2.1 9 10-14 2.3 9 10-14 2.0 9 10-15  element software feflow is used to model pressuredriven and thermally induced ﬂuid ﬂow including viscosity changes. governing equations for ﬂuid ﬂow and heat transport in saturated porous media are derived from conservation principles of linear momentum, mass, and energy (dhi-wasy 2009). details on the software and the parameterization can be found in diersch (2014).  the model geometry is a 2d vertical sw–ne trending cross section extending 6 km in horizontal and 3 km in vertical direction. the direction of the proﬁle has been selected to cover all relevant processes in the lahendong geothermal ﬁeld: it cuts major faults and the production and injection wells, which are used for temperature and pressure calibration. furthermore, to the groundwater ﬂow direction, showing major ﬂuid ﬂow activities. the homogeneous and isotropic geological layers in the model are stratiﬁed nearly horizontally. faults in the middle of the model, striking perpendicular to the cross section, dip with 84° toward a cooling pluton beneath lake linau. details on structural and geological components of the modeled region have been presented in brehme et al. (2014).  is parallel  it  the numerical  the mesh used for  simulation in feflow consists of 45,264 nodes and 89,320 elements that are denser surrounding the faults because of expected gradients due to parameter contrasts. material properties of  123  elements are permeability, porosity, and thermal conductivity and set according to laboratory measurements (table 1). however, properties of the faults and lake linau are slightly adapted to speciﬁc conditions. the definitions for the modeled grids along the faults are as follows: porosity is 30 % and thermal conductivity is 1.8 w m-1 k-1. corresponding grids for lake linau are deﬁned by a porosity of 100 % and a thermal conductivity of 0.6 w m-1 k-1. the model simulates ﬂuid ﬂow and thermal transport in saturated media in steady state.  initial values and boundary conditions  fluid ﬂow boundary conditions in the model describe groundwater heads and recharge amounts (table 2; fig. 2). the hydraulic head at the sw model boundary is 837 m and 500 m at the ne boundary. the sw hydraulic head represents inﬁltration of surface water into a fault, striking perpendicular to the model. hydraulic head at the ne border is adapted to borehole measurements in that area (brehme et al. 2014). inﬁltration into the fault zones at lake linau is described by ﬂuid ﬂux boundary conditions. the quantity is 3.0 9 10-4 m s-1 the sw and 1.3 9 10-6 m s-1 at the ne fault distributed over 40 m fault width. groundwater recharge is set to 412 mm a-1 at the ne top surface (table 2; fig. 2). fluid movement in  for  \\x0cthe model domain is constrained by no-ﬂow boundary at the bottom, recharge through the surrounding fault zones, and the low hydraulic heads in the ne model area. discharge of the system in the central study area is mainly toward lake linau and across the ne model boundary. initial hydraulic head for the whole model domain is 500 m.  the heat  is 116 °c km-1 at  transport boundary conditions are time-invariant, ﬁxed temperatures, and heat ﬂux (table 2; fig. 2). thermal gradient the sw model boundary, and the temperature is constant 350 °c at the pluton. temperature of water inﬁltrating into faults and here mixing with shallow warm groundwater is 70 °c, while surface groundwater recharge is at 28 °c. temperature values are obtained from ﬁeld and bore log measurements (brehme et al. 2014). heat ﬂux is set to 100 mw m-2 at the bottom model boundary (table 2; fig. 2). this value is ﬁxed based on the studies from delisle et al. (1998), nagao and uyeda (1995), and neben et al. (1998). initial temperature for the model domain is set as 116 °c km-1, according to the local thermal gradient.  permeability determination  initial values for permeability are deﬁned based on laboratory measurements (table 1). after each simulation run, modeled and measured temperature and pressure values have been compared at indicated observation points. in case of poor matching (errors [10 %), permeability has been adjusted until satisfactory results have been achieved. beneath lake linau, simulation results showed locally strong discrepancies between modeled and measured pressure and temperature (errors [45 %). adjustment of permeability in geological inﬁltration rates into faults, or hydraulic heads did not lead to acceptable results. only the implementation of strong permeability anisotropy throughout whole depth, i.e., an additional fault, resulted in minimization of errors (0–7 %). implementation has been accomplished by mesh adaptation to ensure appropriate behavior around the fault. by this procedure, permeability anisotropies have been located and characterized in detail throughout the model.  layers,  in general, deﬁning a direction-dependent permeability improves the data ﬁt rather than using similar permeabilities in all directions. this is probably due to the fractures increasing the permeability mostly in vertical direction.  porosity and thermal conductivity remained constant throughout simulation. variation in porosity is negligible because it would directly be reﬂected in permeability, while thermal conductivity differences would only affect conductive heat transport, which is not dominant in the lahendong area (ondrak et al. 1998; brehme et al. 2014).  123  100c  measurementa  500borelog  ofmodel bottom  boundary

performed to obtain the best ﬁt to the measured data changing the absolute and relative permeability in geological elements. relative permeability refers to different permeabilities in horizontal and vertical direction. as a main result, a blind fault has been recognized beneath lake linau, which has not been known from former studies. simulated pressure and temperature are measured at ﬁve selected observation points, which represent boreholes with available bore logs for pressure and temperature. details on data are given in fig. 6. the model with best data ﬁt, out of 370 different models, is considered to generate the ﬁnal model developed for lahendong.  permeability distribution and identiﬁcation of a blind fault  distribution of permeability patterns in the reservoir has been conceived comparing temperature and pressure data in several wells. especially beneath lake linau, closely located wells show high variations in temperature and pressure. a drop of 100 °c and 18 bar along 300 m distance has been observed between well lhd 24 and lhd 28. models ﬁrst showed high discrepancies between modeled and measured values in this area. however, after implementing another high anisotropic permeable structure between the observation points, models resulted in satisfactory results. the structure has ten times higher vertical  environ earth sci (2016) 75:1088  permeability than horizontal permeability. this structure is assumed to be another fault zone located between two known faults with vertical dip and nw strike. this fault shows no trace at surface, because it is covered by lake linau.  generally, modeled permeability distribution in the lahendong reservoir is direction-dependent and overprints the lithology. modeled permeability is generally higher than measured ones in the order of up to four magnitudes. this is due to fracture patterns, which are not detectable at core-sample scale. permeability patterns directly affect subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow and temperature and pressure distribution.  permeability in the faulted zones and surroundings is lowest in the study area. especially the middle and ne fault, the shallow area beneath sw lake linau and the deep ne section of the ne fault show low permeabilities between 10-13 and 10-14 m2 (fig. 3). the area between the middle and ne fault, the deep section ne of the sw fault, the sw fault itself and the whole model area toward the sw and ne boundary show higher permeabilities of 10-10 and 10-12 m2 (fig. 3).  permeability varies not only within the modeled area, but also in vertical and horizontal direction. in faults and the deep reservoir section in the ne, permeability is by a factor of 10 higher in the vertical direction than in the horizontal direction (fig. 3). in the areas between faults, permeability is in some parts by a factor of 10–100 lower in the vertical direction. in the rest of the model, vertical and horizontal permeability do not differ (fig. 3).  fig. 3 final

suggests that convective heat transport is the dominating process in the reservoir rocks. isotherms generally follow the sw–ne oriented ﬂow pattern, the rise and the inﬁltration of ﬂuids. upwelling of isotherms between the faults veriﬁes water rise toward lake linau. inﬁltration of cold water causes down welling of isotherms particularly on the northeast section of the model. temperature is locally increased at the bottom of the model surrounding the pluton (fig. 4).  subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow  the absolute and horizontal/vertical permeability distribution controls local ﬂuid ﬂow in the lahendong reservoir.  the general ﬂuid ﬂow, driven by the natural pressure gradient, is oriented from sw to ne. vertical inﬁltration occurs at faults at lake linau and at the sw boundary. discharge is across the ne model boundary (fig. 5). the more detailed ﬂow patterns can be observed with streamlines, which show a ﬂuid ﬂow along highly permeable areas. calculated streamlines describe particle ﬂow within the model domain. a forward calculation shows how inﬁltrating water at the sw model boundary distributes through the reservoir. the backward calculation shows the source of ﬂuid particles arriving at the ne model boundary (fig. 5). patterns show that hot groundwater ﬂows toward the faults beneath lake linau, where the ﬂuid ﬂow is disturbed by a rise in temperature and vertically high permeable layers. this causes a rise of groundwater in this model area (red forward streamlines in fig. 5). at the same time, cold water inﬁltrates into high permeable areas and distributes over the ne model domain (blue backward streamlines in fig. 5). it is clearly seen that the composition of the ne reservoir domain is dominated by coldwater inﬁltration into faults, while the production areas are characterized by hot water ﬂow (fig. 5).  discussion  investigation of subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow in geothermal reservoirs is crucial for sustainable exploitation avoiding drilling into less productive areas. subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow might be locally inﬂuenced by fault zones or physical  123  \\x0c1088 page 8 of 11  environ earth sci (2016) 75:1088  fig. 5 model domain with calculated streamlines, in

water (i.e. viscosity). the inﬂuence of these parameters on the ﬂuid ﬂow has been investigated in lahendong geothermal reservoir using hydraulic–thermal simulations. simulation results show the detailed permeability distribution in the reservoir including location of an additional fault zone.  matching of measured and simulated temperature and pressure has been used as a tool for resolving the permeability distribution. temperature and pressure have been iteratively determined at several observation points (fig. 2). generally, modeled values are in good agreement with observed ones (fig. 6). nevertheless, some observation points give slightly different values for both pressure and temperature (lhd 4 and lhd 7) or only temperature (lhd 24). this is probably due to the complicated ﬂow processes or strong small-scale structural variation in fractured and faulted areas. furthermore, density variations, which could have not been included into simulation due to high temperatures, could cause variation of ﬂuid pressure. however, the average deviation of simulated pressure and temperature is 1 %.  implemented model parameters are porosity, permeability, and heat conductivity. from those parameters, only permeability has been tested in a speciﬁc range during simulation. the inﬂuence of porosity and heat conductivity on ﬂuid ﬂow is negligible due to dominating convective heat ﬂow (ondrak et al. 1998). values implemented in the model are based on measured permeabilities, which represent matrix permeability of rocks.  the measured matrix permeability, representing permeability in horizontal direction, is 1.5 9 10-14 m2 on  123  average, which remains within typical permeability range for fractured igneous rocks (schoen 2004). permeability for volcanic breccias ranges typically between 3 9 10-15 and 5 9 10-12 m2 and tuff permeabilities range between 7 9 10-17 and 7 9 10-12 m2 (klavetter and peters 1987). in the wairakei geothermal ﬁeld, simulating the impermeable layers resulted in permeabilities of 10-18 and 10-14 m2, in horizontal and vertical axis, respectively (mercer and faust 1979).  however, permeability in reservoir rocks might be locally increased due to fracture formation. it might also be decreased due to alteration and sealing in faults. in lahendong, modeled permeability can be up to four magnitudes higher than measured ones in faulted areas. this is caused by fractures, which are not detectable in core scale. moreover, in fault cores, it is by a factor of 10 higher in vertical direction than in horizontal direction. however, in areas between faults (fault gauge), permeability is in some parts by a factor of 10–100 lower in the vertical direction. adaptation of permeability ensures a ﬁt to measured temperature and pressure data.  permeability in fractured areas is the main factor inﬂuencing subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow and temperature distribution in the lahendong reservoir area. subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow is driven by local hydraulic heads, which show high variations at different sections of the study area. consequently, convective heat distribution leads to high temperature variation along the reservoir. these phenomena are observed in lahendong as well as comparable ﬁelds. in new mexico, water level drops of 30–100 m are observed across (haneberg 1995). high  several  fault  zones  \\x0c123  environ earth sci (2016)

(2014)  temperature drops and upwelling of isotherms indicate that fault zones control the ﬂuid ﬂow in the lake long and valentine ﬁelds, usa (hooper 1991). the analysis of ﬂuid pressure differences at the alpine fault, new zealand, allowed to characterize the change in permeability between hanging and footwall blocks (sutherland et al. 2012).  in summary, high pressure or temperature gradients are indicators for ﬂuid barriers between observation points. in other words, reservoir sections of different properties are separated by horizontally less permeable faults. in lahendong, most signiﬁcant ﬂuid barriers are faults to the sw and to the ne of lake linau. across these barriers, the pressure drops up to 20 bars. a similar pattern has been measured in bore logs beneath lake linau, where no surface trace of a fault had been observed in former studies. however, only by implementing another fault, modeled and measured values could have been adapted. the recently identiﬁed fault zone beneath lake linau remains under lake water and therefore is only traceable by this kind of reservoir modeling.  additionally to fault identiﬁcation, the internal structure of known fault zones has been understood in detail. the ne fault, i.e., shows a displacement at 2 km depth. the detailed trend has been understood by permeability adaptation in this area.  due to low permeability in horizontal direction in the faults, ﬂuids propagate mostly vertically toward the hot springs at surface. it also allows surface water to inﬁltrate into the reservoir in case the pressure within the fault zone is low enough (fig. 5). this vertical ﬂuid movement  eventually controls the temperature distribution in the reservoir. upward migration of deep hot water increases the temperature, while inﬁltration of cold surface water causes local drop of temperature.  in summary, the most important factors inﬂuencing the reliability of numerical reservoir models are absolute and different horizontal and vertical permeability. however, a permeability adaptation has been done for each geological layer; the vertical permeability anomalies are overprinting those layers and are constraining the regional groundwater ﬂow. those permeabilities of fractures directly inﬂuence the productivity of the reservoir (cherubini et al. 2013). therefore, their permeability characteristics should be investigated in detail.  in a previous study, a numerical model for the lahendong site has been set up in tough2 and aimed at forecasting the reservoir behavior during exploitation until the year 2036. with a production of 60 mwe, it predicts a pressure drop of 10 bars. however, the forecast results are uncertain due to lack of measured pressure draw down data (yani 2006). accordingly, the next steps of the presented study should include a realistic production and injection scenario in order reservoir exploitation. furthermore, chemical characteristics could be considered to achieve reliable production setups, because hydrochemical processes play an important role in the lahendong reservoir (brehme et al. 2016). presented models from this study provide important information on ﬂuid ﬂow in the water-dominated lahendong reservoir. however, additional the  two-phase ﬂow models of  to support  sustainable  \\x0c1088 page 10 of 11  environ earth sci (2016) 75:1088  lahendong area are in progress to understand the inﬂuence of steam driven ﬂuid ﬂow in this high-temperature system.  conclusion  the primary focus of this study is to understand the inﬂuence of fault zones and permeability patterns on subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow in geothermal reservoirs. the ﬂuid ﬂow mainly depends on rock and fault zone permeability. these processes have been considered in numerical models, which simulate local temperature and pressure conditions. the initial reservoir conditions, which refers to the case before production starts. models are developed based on the conceptual models of the study area, which explain reservoir geometry, geological structures, temperature, and hydraulic conditions. temperature and pressure well-logs have been used for model calibration.  the numerical

surface. by stepwise adaptation of permeability ﬁelds, based on observed temperature and pressure gradients, an additional blind fault zone can be identiﬁed beneath lake linau. temperature and pressure signiﬁcantly drop across that ﬂuid barrier. this behavior has been observed in comparable ﬁelds in the usa as well. the overall shape of ﬂuid ﬂow direction trends in a sw–ne direction. main recharge occurs by inﬁltration of surface water into the faults, especially in the southwest and near to lake linau. discharge is enhanced in highly fractured areas toward lake linau. vertical permeability of faults allows ﬂuids rising toward the hot springs at surface.  results show that permeability has to be considered for simulation of a geothermal system. the geothermal system is mainly controlled by ﬂuid ﬂow in fractures/faults depending on temperature and pressure conditions. the locally modiﬁed ﬂuid ﬂow can considerably inﬂuence the productivity of a geothermal ﬁeld. results also guide reservoir management in case of a potential for ﬁeld extension, as performed in lahendong.  acknowledgments the authors acknowledge the continuous support within the team of the

(2001). additionally, there are several sites exemplifying similar characteristics as in lahendong. the underground movement of hot and cold ﬂuids has been modeled for geothermal ﬁelds in new zealand (kaya et al. 2014). the kakkonda geothermal site, e.g., consists of two reservoirs at various depths with different ﬂuid properties. there, results from ﬂuid ﬂow analysis show the importance of fractures for ﬂuid transport enhancing the recharge or discharge in the reservoir 123\\x0c1088 page 2 of 11 environ earth sci (2016) 75:1088 (mcguinness et al. 1995). generally, faults acting as preferential ﬂuid path ways signiﬁcantly change the pressure and temperature ﬁeld in the reservoir (cherubini et al. 2013). models for the seferihisar–balc¸ova ﬁeld focus on the ﬂuid ﬂow inside of faults. results show an enhanced upward heat transport through ﬂuids from bottom of the geothermal system (magri et al. 2011). our test ground is the lahendong geothermal ﬁeld located in sulawesi, indonesia. the ﬁeld is owned and operated by p.t. pertamina geothermal energy and hosts a power plant with a production capacity of 80 mwe. there, geothermal exploration started in the early 1970s including geophysical and geohydrochemical approaches. it is a water-dominated magmatic structurally controlled system. faults generally act as across-fault ﬂuid barriers and alongfault ﬂuid conductors (brehme et al. 2014). as a result, hot springs mainly appear on the top of vertically permeable faults at the surface. available numerous drilling and surface measurements allowed a detailed characterization of the geological and hydrogeological setting of the area (fig. 1; brehme et al. 2011, 2013, 2014, 2016; wiegand et al. 2013). the model presented here is developed for investigating subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow and the permeability distribution including the fault zones in the lahendong geothermal ﬁeld. below, the geological structure of the ﬁeld is presented followed by an introduction to the modeling approach. detailed investigation of subsurface permeability distribution is a crucial step for site selection and smart drilling strategies. the numerical simulations presented will provide insight into understanding the subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow considering the hydraulic conductivity of faults. it ensures productive as well as sustainable operation of geothermal ﬁelds avoiding risks, such as drilling into non-fractured or cold zones, and targeting highly corroding waters. although the target area is lahendong, the general workﬂow is applicable for other geothermal sites consisting of similar constraints. reservoir characterization hydrogeology the overall driving force for the ﬂuid ﬂow is the sw–ne oriented natural hydraulic gradient in the lahendong geothermal system. the direction of ﬂuid ﬂow varies through the geothermal site due to horizontal partitioning of the reservoir by relatively less permeable fault zones (brehme et al. 2014). the basic sections are located in the fig. 1 topographic map of the study area with geological features, water and rock sample locations, and model cross section 123\\x0cenviron earth sci (2016) 75:1088 page 3 of 11 1088 south, in the east, and beneath lake linau. beneath lake linau, the direction of ﬂuid ﬂow is slightly rotated to wsw–ene (fig. 1). also, types of ﬂuid change from one section to another, e.g., an acidic highly saline-type beneath lake linau and a neutral low saline-type south and east of lake linau (fig. 1). the impermeable structure across faults prevent the ﬂuids from diluting each other (brehme et al. 2016). however, faults are rather permeable along the vertical axis, which allows recharge of the system through the faults. rainwater inﬁltrates at a fault in the sw, at mt. lengkoan, and creek water inﬁltrates into the normal faults at lake linau (fig. 2). the hydrothermal system discharges into lake linau and toward the ne, as driven by the hydraulic gradient (brehme et al. 2014). the fracture network along the area is characterized by strike slip faults and normal faults. the sinistral faults strike n 40° and steeply dip toward the se. left step over on the strike slip faults forms an extension basin in the central study area. normal faults at the extension basin strike nw and dip 70°–80° beneath lake linau (brehme et al. 2014). lithology lahendong area is mainly characterized by pre-, postand tondano formation of plioto pleistocene age (koestono et al. 2010). the rocks are typically andesite, volcanic breccia, and tuff. those types have been sampled from borehole cores and used to determine porosity, permeability, and thermal conductivity. effective porosity and matrix permeability have been analyzed using a cylindrical-shaped specimen with a dimension of 5 cm x 5 cm 9 2.5 cm oriented parallel to the coring (brehme et al. 2016). thermal conductivity has been measured on plain sections of dried cores. the experimental setup consists of a gas permeameter for determining matrix permeability (milsch et al. 2011), of an helium pycnometry for effective porosity measurements (johnson-maynard et al. 1994) and of an optical scanner for thermal conductivity measurements (popov et al. 1999). these parameters have been measured and averaged for the three rock types (brehme et al. 2016; table 1). andesite has an effective porosity of 3.7 %, a permeability of 2.1 9 10-14 m2, and a thermal conductivity of 1.8 w m-1 k-1 (dry) or 2.2 w m-1 k-1 (saturated). tuff has a porosity of 7.7 % but the lowest permeability of 2.0 9 10-15 m2 of 1.6 w m-1 k-1 (saturated). volcanic breccia is a permeable layer with an effective porosity of 10.5 %, a permeability of 2.3 9 10-14 m2, and a thermal conductivity of 1.6 w m-1 k-1 (dry) or 2.5 w m-1 k-1 (saturated). reservoir rocks reﬂect generally low matrix permeability suggesting fracture-controlled ﬂuid ﬂow throughout the aquifer (brehme et al. 2016). and (dry) or 2.1 w m-1 k-1 a thermal conductivity model setup model geometry numerical models developed for the study area represent the initial conditions of the reservoir before production or the commercial ﬁnite injection start. for simulation, fig. 2 cross section of the modeled area with geological structure, boundary conditions, and location of observation points 123\\x0c1088 page 4 of 11 environ earth sci (2016) 75:1088 table 1 thermal and hydraulic parameters of the lahendong reservoir rocks measured in laboratory (brehme et al. 2016) sample (name, depth) rock type effective porosity (%) thermal conductivity dry (w m-1 k-1) thermal conductivity saturated (w m-1 k-1) matrix permeability (m2) lhd1 500–501 lhd1 801–802 lhd1 1000–1001 lhd1 2100–2101 lhd2 300–302 lhd3 2201–2203 lhd4 652–653 lhd4 850–852 lhd4 1001–1002 lhd4 2304–2305 lhd5 602–603 lhd5 752–753 lhd5 1102–1103 lhd5 1404–1406 lhd5 1575–1576 lhd7 901–902,3 lhd7 1567.8–1568 lhd7 1756–1758 average values a b t t a b b a b a b a a a a a t b andesite (a) breccia (b) tuff (t) 1.1 14.5 5.0 7.2 12.5 5.7 6.3 1.6 16.4 1.6 16.3 2.7 5.2 3.6 0.6 4.6 11.0 3.9 3.7 10.5 7.7 (lhd1 550) 2.0 (lhd1 550) 2.2 1.6 1.8 1.4 2.1 1.8 1.4 1.8 1.4 1.9 1.5 1.6 2.1 1.8 1.6 1.6 2.4 2.2 2.0 2.4 2.0 2.7 2.7 2.3 2.3 1.7 2.2 2.7 2.2 2.5 2.1 1.5 9 10-14 8.9 9 10-16 3.3 9 10-15 6.1 9 10-14 1.5 9 10-14 1.3 9 10-14 2.3 9 10-14 6.8 9 10-14 3.4 9 10-16 1.1 9 10-14 1.1 9 10-16 7.9 9 10-14 3.0 9 10-15 7.9 9 10-18 7.2 9 10-16 1.7 9 10-15 1.7 9 10-14 2.1 9 10-14 2.3 9 10-14 2.0 9 10-15 element software feflow is used to model pressuredriven and thermally induced ﬂuid ﬂow including viscosity changes. governing equations for ﬂuid ﬂow and heat transport in saturated porous media are derived from conservation principles of linear momentum, mass, and energy (dhi-wasy 2009). details on the software and the parameterization can be found in diersch (2014). the model geometry is a 2d vertical sw–ne trending cross section extending 6 km in horizontal and 3 km in vertical direction. the direction of the proﬁle has been selected to cover all relevant processes in the lahendong geothermal ﬁeld: it cuts major faults and the production and injection wells, which are used for temperature and pressure calibration. furthermore, to the groundwater ﬂow direction, showing major ﬂuid ﬂow activities. the homogeneous and isotropic geological layers in the model are stratiﬁed nearly horizontally. faults in the middle of the model, striking perpendicular to the cross section, dip with 84° toward a cooling pluton beneath lake linau. details on structural and geological components of the modeled region have been presented in brehme et al. (2014). is parallel it the numerical the mesh used for simulation in feflow consists of 45,264 nodes and 89,320 elements that are denser surrounding the faults because of expected gradients due to parameter contrasts. material properties of 123 elements are permeability, porosity, and thermal conductivity and set according to laboratory measurements (table 1). however, properties of the faults and lake linau are slightly adapted to speciﬁc conditions. the definitions for the modeled grids along the faults are as follows: porosity is 30 % and thermal conductivity is 1.8 w m-1 k-1. corresponding grids for lake linau are deﬁned by a porosity of 100 % and a thermal conductivity of 0.6 w m-1 k-1. the model simulates ﬂuid ﬂow and thermal transport in saturated media in steady state. initial values and boundary conditions fluid ﬂow boundary conditions in the model describe groundwater heads and recharge amounts (table 2; fig. 2). the hydraulic head at the sw model boundary is 837 m and 500 m at the ne boundary. the sw hydraulic head represents inﬁltration of surface water into a fault, striking perpendicular to the model. hydraulic head at the ne border is adapted to borehole measurements in that area (brehme et al. 2014). inﬁltration into the fault zones at lake linau is described by ﬂuid ﬂux boundary conditions. the quantity is 3.0 9 10-4 m s-1 the sw and 1.3 9 10-6 m s-1 at the ne fault distributed over 40 m fault width. groundwater recharge is set to 412 mm a-1 at the ne top surface (table 2; fig. 2). fluid movement in for\\x0cthe model domain is constrained by no-ﬂow boundary at the bottom, recharge through the surrounding fault zones, and the low hydraulic heads in the ne model area. discharge of the system in the central study area is mainly toward lake linau and across the ne model boundary. initial hydraulic head for the whole model domain is 500 m. the heat is 116 °c km-1 at transport boundary conditions are time-invariant, ﬁxed temperatures, and heat ﬂux (table 2; fig. 2). thermal gradient the sw model boundary, and the temperature is constant 350 °c at the pluton. temperature of water inﬁltrating into faults and here mixing with shallow warm groundwater is 70 °c, while surface groundwater recharge is at 28 °c. temperature values are obtained from ﬁeld and bore log measurements (brehme et al. 2014). heat ﬂux is set to 100 mw m-2 at the bottom model boundary (table 2; fig. 2). this value is ﬁxed based on the studies from delisle et al. (1998), nagao and uyeda (1995), and neben et al. (1998). initial temperature for the model domain is set as 116 °c km-1, according to the local thermal gradient. permeability determination initial values for permeability are deﬁned based on laboratory measurements (table 1). after each simulation run, modeled and measured temperature and pressure values have been compared at indicated observation points. in case of poor matching (errors [10 %), permeability has been adjusted until satisfactory results have been achieved. beneath lake linau, simulation results showed locally strong discrepancies between modeled and measured pressure and temperature (errors [45 %). adjustment of permeability in geological inﬁltration rates into faults, or hydraulic heads did not lead to acceptable results. only the implementation of strong permeability anisotropy throughout whole depth, i.e., an additional fault, resulted in minimization of errors (0–7 %). implementation has been accomplished by mesh adaptation to ensure appropriate behavior around the fault. by this procedure, permeability anisotropies have been located and characterized in detail throughout the model. layers, in general, deﬁning a direction-dependent permeability improves the data ﬁt rather than using similar permeabilities in all directions. this is probably due to the fractures increasing the permeability mostly in vertical direction. porosity and thermal conductivity remained constant throughout simulation. variation in porosity is negligible because it would directly be reﬂected in permeability, while thermal conductivity differences would only affect conductive heat transport, which is not dominant in the lahendong area (ondrak et al. 1998; brehme et al. 2014). 123 100c measurementa 500borelog ofmodel bottom boundary nemodel

temperature and pressure data in several wells. especially beneath lake linau, closely located wells show high variations in temperature and pressure. a drop of 100 °c and 18 bar along 300 m distance has been observed between well lhd 24 and lhd 28. models ﬁrst showed high discrepancies between modeled and measured values in this area. however, after implementing another high anisotropic permeable structure between the observation points, models resulted in satisfactory results. the structure has ten times higher vertical environ earth sci (2016) 75:1088 permeability than horizontal permeability. this structure is assumed to be another fault zone located between two known faults with vertical dip and nw strike. this fault shows no trace at surface, because it is covered by lake linau. generally, modeled permeability distribution in the lahendong reservoir is direction-dependent and overprints the lithology. modeled permeability is generally higher than measured ones in the order of up to four magnitudes. this is due to fracture patterns, which are not detectable at core-sample scale. permeability patterns directly affect subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow and temperature and pressure distribution. permeability in the faulted zones and surroundings is lowest in the study area. especially the middle and ne fault, the shallow area beneath sw lake linau and the deep ne section of the ne fault show low permeabilities between 10-13 and 10-14 m2 (fig. 3). the area between the middle and ne fault, the deep section ne of the sw fault, the sw fault itself and the whole model area toward the sw and ne boundary show higher permeabilities of 10-10 and 10-12 m2 (fig. 3). permeability varies not only within the modeled area, but also in vertical and horizontal direction. in faults and the deep reservoir section in the ne, permeability is by a factor of 10 higher in the vertical direction than in the horizontal direction (fig. 3). in the areas between faults, permeability is in some parts by a factor of 10–100 lower in the vertical direction. in the rest of the model, vertical and horizontal permeability do not differ (fig. 3). fig. 3 final adapted permeability and anisotropy

elevations in the sw. some wells existing in this region are of artesian-type. overpressure releases through high permeable zones beneath lake linau and discharges toward surface. the pressure drop is up to 20 bars across the faults (fig. 4). temperature distribution temperature distribution along the lahendong geothermal reservoir suggests that convective heat transport is the dominating process in the reservoir rocks. isotherms generally follow the sw–ne oriented ﬂow pattern, the rise and the inﬁltration of ﬂuids. upwelling of isotherms between the faults veriﬁes water rise toward lake linau. inﬁltration of cold water causes down welling of isotherms particularly on the northeast section of the model. temperature is locally increased at the bottom of the model surrounding the pluton (fig. 4). subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow the absolute and horizontal/vertical permeability distribution controls local ﬂuid ﬂow in the lahendong reservoir. the general ﬂuid ﬂow, driven by the natural pressure gradient, is oriented from sw to ne. vertical inﬁltration occurs at faults at lake linau and at the sw boundary. discharge is across the ne model boundary (fig. 5). the more detailed ﬂow patterns can be observed with streamlines, which show a ﬂuid ﬂow along highly permeable areas. calculated streamlines describe particle ﬂow within the model domain. a forward calculation shows how inﬁltrating water at the sw model boundary distributes through the reservoir. the backward calculation shows the source of ﬂuid particles arriving at the ne model boundary (fig. 5). patterns show that hot groundwater ﬂows toward the faults beneath lake linau, where the ﬂuid ﬂow is disturbed by a rise in temperature and vertically high permeable layers. this causes a rise of groundwater in this model area (red forward streamlines in fig. 5). at the same time, cold water inﬁltrates into high permeable areas and distributes over the ne model domain (blue backward streamlines in fig. 5). it is clearly seen that the composition of the ne reservoir domain is dominated by coldwater inﬁltration into faults, while the production areas are characterized by hot water ﬂow (fig. 5). discussion investigation of subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow in geothermal reservoirs is crucial for sustainable exploitation avoiding drilling into less productive areas. subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow might be locally inﬂuenced by fault zones or physical 123\\x0c1088 page 8 of 11 environ earth sci (2016) 75:1088 fig. 5 model domain with calculated streamlines, in red: forward streamlines follow hydraulic gradient from sw model boundary towards ne, in blue: backward streamlines representing inﬁltrating cold water ﬂowing towards ne model boundary properties of water (i.e. viscosity). the inﬂuence of these parameters on the ﬂuid ﬂow has been investigated in lahendong geothermal reservoir using hydraulic–thermal simulations. simulation results show the detailed permeability distribution in the reservoir including location of an additional fault zone. matching of measured and simulated temperature and pressure has been used as a tool for resolving the permeability distribution. temperature and pressure have been iteratively determined at several observation points (fig. 2). generally, modeled values are in good agreement with observed ones (fig. 6). nevertheless, some observation points give slightly different values for both pressure and temperature (lhd 4 and lhd 7) or only temperature (lhd 24). this is probably due to the complicated ﬂow processes or strong small-scale structural variation in fractured and faulted areas. furthermore, density variations, which could have not been included into simulation due to high temperatures, could cause variation of ﬂuid pressure. however, the average deviation of simulated pressure and temperature is 1 %. implemented model parameters are porosity, permeability, and heat conductivity. from those parameters, only permeability has been tested in a speciﬁc range during simulation. the inﬂuence of porosity and heat conductivity on ﬂuid ﬂow is negligible due to dominating convective heat ﬂow (ondrak et al. 1998). values implemented in the model are based on measured permeabilities, which represent matrix permeability of rocks. the measured matrix permeability, representing permeability in horizontal direction, is 1.5 9 10-14 m2 on 123 average, which remains within typical permeability range for fractured igneous rocks (schoen 2004). permeability for volcanic breccias ranges typically between 3 9 10-15 and 5 9 10-12 m2 and tuff permeabilities range between 7 9 10-17 and 7 9 10-12 m2 (klavetter and peters 1987). in the wairakei geothermal ﬁeld, simulating the impermeable layers resulted in permeabilities of 10-18 and 10-14 m2, in horizontal and vertical axis, respectively (mercer and faust 1979). however, permeability in reservoir rocks might be locally increased due to fracture formation. it might also be decreased due to alteration and sealing in faults. in lahendong, modeled permeability can be up to four magnitudes higher than measured ones in faulted areas. this is caused by fractures, which are not detectable in core scale. moreover, in fault cores, it is by a factor of 10 higher in vertical direction than in horizontal direction. however, in areas between faults (fault gauge), permeability is in some parts by a factor of 10–100 lower in the vertical direction. adaptation of permeability ensures a ﬁt to measured temperature and pressure data. permeability in fractured areas is the main factor inﬂuencing subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow and temperature distribution in the lahendong reservoir area. subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow is driven by local hydraulic heads, which show high variations at different sections of the study area. consequently, convective heat distribution leads to high temperature variation along the reservoir. these phenomena are observed in lahendong as well as comparable ﬁelds. in new mexico, water level drops of 30–100 m are observed across (haneberg 1995). high several fault zones\\x0c123 environ earth sci (2016) 75:1088 page 9 of 11 1088 7 24 4 28 5 well name lhd 4 lhd 5 lhd 7

from brehme et al. (2014) temperature drops and upwelling of isotherms indicate that fault zones control the ﬂuid ﬂow in the lake long and valentine ﬁelds, usa (hooper 1991). the analysis of ﬂuid pressure differences at the alpine fault, new zealand, allowed to characterize the change in permeability between hanging and footwall blocks (sutherland et al. 2012). in summary, high pressure or temperature gradients are indicators for ﬂuid barriers between observation points. in other words, reservoir sections of different properties are separated by horizontally less permeable faults. in lahendong, most signiﬁcant ﬂuid barriers are faults to the sw and to the ne of lake linau. across these barriers, the pressure drops up to 20 bars. a similar pattern has been measured in bore logs beneath lake linau, where no surface trace of a fault had been observed in former studies. however, only by implementing another fault, modeled and measured values could have been adapted. the recently identiﬁed fault zone beneath lake linau remains under lake water and therefore is only traceable by this kind of reservoir modeling. additionally to fault identiﬁcation, the internal structure of known fault zones has been understood in detail. the ne fault, i.e., shows a displacement at 2 km depth. the detailed trend has been understood by permeability adaptation in this area. due to low permeability in horizontal direction in the faults, ﬂuids propagate mostly vertically toward the hot springs at surface. it also allows surface water to inﬁltrate into the reservoir in case the pressure within the fault zone is low enough (fig. 5). this vertical ﬂuid movement eventually controls the temperature distribution in the reservoir. upward migration of deep hot water increases the temperature, while inﬁltration of cold surface water causes local drop of temperature. in summary, the most important factors inﬂuencing the reliability of numerical reservoir models are absolute and different horizontal and vertical permeability. however, a permeability adaptation has been done for each geological layer; the vertical permeability anomalies are overprinting those layers and are constraining the regional groundwater ﬂow. those permeabilities of fractures directly inﬂuence the productivity of the reservoir (cherubini et al. 2013). therefore, their permeability characteristics should be investigated in detail. in a previous study, a numerical model for the lahendong site has been set up in tough2 and aimed at forecasting the reservoir behavior during exploitation until the year 2036. with a production of 60 mwe, it predicts a pressure drop of 10 bars. however, the forecast results are uncertain due to lack of measured pressure draw down data (yani 2006). accordingly, the next steps of the presented study should include a realistic production and injection scenario in order reservoir exploitation. furthermore, chemical characteristics could be considered to achieve reliable production setups, because hydrochemical processes play an important role in the lahendong reservoir (brehme et al. 2016). presented models from this study provide important information on ﬂuid ﬂow in the water-dominated lahendong reservoir. however, additional the two-phase ﬂow models of to support sustainable\\x0c1088 page 10 of 11 environ earth sci (2016) 75:1088 lahendong area are in progress to understand the inﬂuence of steam driven ﬂuid ﬂow in this high-temperature system. conclusion the primary focus of this study is to understand the inﬂuence of fault zones and permeability patterns on subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow in geothermal reservoirs. the ﬂuid ﬂow mainly depends on rock and fault zone permeability. these processes have been considered in numerical models, which simulate local temperature and pressure conditions. the initial reservoir conditions, which refers to the case before production starts. models are developed based on the conceptual models of the study area, which explain reservoir geometry, geological structures, temperature, and hydraulic conditions. temperature and pressure well-logs have been used for model calibration. the numerical models represent vertical and horizontal ﬂuid ﬂow is mainly controlled by fault permeability. this characteristic is used to simulate different reservoir sections, and vertical ﬂuid rise toward the surface. by stepwise adaptation of permeability ﬁelds, based on observed temperature and pressure gradients, an additional blind fault zone can be identiﬁed beneath lake linau. temperature and pressure signiﬁcantly drop across that ﬂuid barrier. this behavior has been observed in comparable ﬁelds in the usa as well. the overall shape of ﬂuid ﬂow direction trends in a sw–ne direction. main recharge occurs by inﬁltration of surface water into the faults, especially in the southwest and near to lake linau. discharge is enhanced in highly fractured areas toward lake linau. vertical permeability of faults allows ﬂuids rising toward the hot springs at surface. results show that permeability has to be considered for simulation of a geothermal system. the geothermal system is mainly controlled by ﬂuid ﬂow in fractures/faults depending on temperature and pressure conditions. the locally modiﬁed ﬂuid ﬂow can considerably inﬂuence the productivity of a geothermal ﬁeld. results also guide reservoir management in case of a potential for ﬁeld extension, as performed in lahendong. acknowledgments the authors acknowledge the continuous support within the team of the international center

july 2016 ó springer-verlag berlin heidelberg 2016 abstract subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow of reservoirs in active tectonic regions is mainly controlled by permeability of fault zones. therefore, the characterization of fault zones is an important step toward performance assessment of a reservoir. the ﬂuid ﬂow is controlled also by pressure and temperature conditions. in this context, we simulated pressure and temperature ﬁelds to elaborate on the inﬂuence of permeability on subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow in the lahendong geothermal reservoir. thermal–hydraulic simulation is performed using a ﬁnite

energy demands. requires developing new geothermal sites and improving the performance of existing systems to satisfy continuously growing demand. the productivity of a geothermal ﬁeld mainly depends on subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow, which in active tectonic regions is controlled by permeability of fault zones (moeck 2014). in that frame, the primary focus is on locating and characterizing faulted areas in geothermal ﬁelds. this study employs numerical modeling to allocate and quantify permeability anisotropies and discontinuities, e.g., faults, in order to understand their inﬂuence on subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow in geothermal reservoirs. numerical models have been increasingly used to understand the setup and productivity of geothermal systems. a general overview of geothermal models has been given by o’ (2001). additionally, there are several sites exemplifying similar characteristics as in lahendong. the underground movement of hot and cold ﬂuids has been modeled for geothermal ﬁelds in new zealand ( 2014). the kakkonda geothermal site, e.g., consists of two reservoirs at various depths with different ﬂuid properties. there, results from ﬂuid ﬂow analysis show the importance of fractures for ﬂuid transport enhancing the recharge or discharge in the reservoir 123\\x0c1088 page 2 of 11 environ earth sci (2016) 75:1088 ( 1995). generally, faults acting as preferential ﬂuid path ways signiﬁcantly change the pressure and temperature ﬁeld in the reservoir ( 2013). models for the seferihisar–balc¸ova ﬁeld focus on the ﬂuid ﬂow inside of faults. results show an enhanced upward heat transport through ﬂuids from bottom of the geothermal system ( 2011). our test ground is the lahendong geothermal ﬁeld located in sulawesi, indonesia. the ﬁeld is owned and operated by p.t. pertamina geothermal energy and hosts a power plant with a production capacity of 80 mwe. there, geothermal exploration started in the early 1970s including geophysical and geohydrochemical approaches. it is a water-dominated magmatic structurally controlled system. faults generally act as across-fault ﬂuid barriers and alongfault ﬂuid conductors ( 2014). as a result, hot springs mainly appear on the top of vertically permeable faults at the surface. available numerous drilling and surface measurements allowed a detailed characterization of the geological and hydrogeological setting of the area (fig. 1;  2011, 2013, 2014, 2016;  2013). the model presented here is developed for investigating subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow and the permeability distribution including the fault zones in the lahendong geothermal ﬁeld. below, the geological structure of the ﬁeld is presented followed by an introduction to the modeling approach. detailed investigation of subsurface permeability distribution is a crucial step for site selection and smart drilling strategies. the numerical simulations presented will provide insight into understanding the subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow considering the hydraulic conductivity of faults. it ensures productive as well as sustainable operation of geothermal ﬁelds avoiding risks, such as drilling into non-fractured or cold zones, and targeting highly corroding waters. although the target area is lahendong, the general workﬂow is applicable for other geothermal sites consisting of similar constraints. reservoir characterization hydrogeology the overall driving force for the ﬂuid ﬂow is the sw–ne oriented natural hydraulic gradient in the lahendong geothermal system. the direction of ﬂuid ﬂow varies through the geothermal site due to horizontal partitioning of the reservoir by relatively less permeable fault zones ( 2014). the basic sections are located in the fig. 1 topographic map of the study area with geological features, water and rock sample locations, and model cross section 123\\x0cenviron earth sci (2016) 75:1088 page 3 of 11 1088 south, in the east, and beneath lake linau. beneath lake linau, the direction of ﬂuid ﬂow is slightly rotated to wsw–ene (fig. 1). also, types of ﬂuid change from one section to another, e.g., an acidic highly saline-type beneath lake linau and a neutral low saline-type south and east of lake linau (fig. 1). the impermeable structure across faults prevent the ﬂuids from diluting each other ( 2016). however, faults are rather permeable along the vertical axis, which allows recharge of the system through the faults. rainwater inﬁltrates at a fault in the sw, at mt. lengkoan, and creek water inﬁltrates into the normal faults at lake linau (fig. 2). the hydrothermal system discharges into lake linau and toward the ne, as driven by the hydraulic gradient ( 2014). the fracture network along the area is characterized by strike slip faults and normal faults. the sinistral faults strike n 40° and steeply dip toward the se. left step over on the strike slip faults forms an extension basin in the central study area. normal faults at the extension basin strike nw and dip 70°–80° beneath lake linau ( 2014). lithology lahendong area is mainly characterized by pre-, postand tondano formation of plioto pleistocene age ( 2010). the rocks are typically andesite, volcanic breccia, and tuff. those types have been sampled from borehole cores and used to determine porosity, permeability, and thermal conductivity. effective porosity and matrix permeability have been analyzed using a cylindrical-shaped

2.3 9 10-14 2.0 9 10-15 element software feflow is used to model pressuredriven and thermally induced ﬂuid ﬂow including viscosity changes. governing equations for ﬂuid ﬂow and heat transport in saturated porous media are derived from conservation principles of linear momentum, mass, and energy (dhi-wasy 2009). details on the software and the parameterization can be found in diersch (2014). the model geometry is a 2d vertical sw–ne trending cross section extending 6 km in horizontal and 3 km in vertical direction. the direction of the proﬁle has been selected to cover all relevant processes in the lahendong geothermal ﬁeld: it cuts major faults and the production and injection wells, which are used for temperature and pressure calibration. furthermore, to the groundwater ﬂow direction, showing major ﬂuid ﬂow activities. the homogeneous and isotropic geological layers in the model are stratiﬁed nearly horizontally. faults in the middle of the model, striking perpendicular to the cross section, dip with 84° toward a cooling pluton beneath lake linau. details on structural and geological components of the modeled region have been presented in  (2014). is parallel it the numerical the mesh used for simulation in feflow consists of 45,264 nodes and 89,320 elements that are denser surrounding the faults because of expected gradients due to parameter contrasts. material properties of 123 elements are permeability, porosity, and thermal conductivity and set according to laboratory measurements (table 1). however, properties of the faults and lake linau are slightly adapted to speciﬁc conditions. the definitions for the modeled grids along the faults are as follows: porosity is 30 % and thermal conductivity is 1.8 w m-1 k-1. corresponding grids for lake linau are deﬁned by a porosity of 100 % and a thermal conductivity of 0.6 w m-1 k-1. the model simulates ﬂuid ﬂow and thermal transport in saturated media in steady state. initial values and boundary conditions fluid ﬂow boundary conditions in the model describe groundwater heads and recharge amounts (table 2; fig. 2). the hydraulic head at the sw model boundary is 837 m and 500 m at the ne boundary. the sw hydraulic head represents inﬁltration of surface water into a fault, striking perpendicular to the model. hydraulic head at the ne border is adapted to borehole measurements in that area ( 2014). inﬁltration into the fault zones at lake linau is described by ﬂuid ﬂux boundary conditions. the quantity is 3.0 9 10-4 m s-1 the sw and 1.3 9 10-6 m s-1 at the ne fault distributed over 40 m fault width. groundwater recharge is set to 412 mm a-1 at the ne top surface (table 2; fig. 2). fluid movement in for\\x0cthe model domain is constrained by no-ﬂow boundary at the bottom, recharge through the surrounding fault zones, and the low hydraulic heads in the ne model area. discharge of the system in the central study area is mainly toward lake linau and across the ne model boundary. initial hydraulic head for the whole model domain is 500 m. the heat is 116 °c km-1 at transport boundary conditions are time-invariant, ﬁxed temperatures, and heat ﬂux (table 2; fig. 2). thermal gradient the sw model boundary, and the temperature is constant 350 °c at the pluton. temperature of water inﬁltrating into faults and here mixing with shallow warm groundwater is 70 °c, while surface groundwater recharge is at 28 °c. temperature values are obtained from ﬁeld and bore log measurements ( 2014). heat ﬂux is set to 100 mw m-2 at the bottom model boundary (table 2; fig. 2). this value is ﬁxed based on the studies from  (1998), nagao and uyeda (1995), and  (1998). initial temperature for the model domain is set as 116 °c km-1, according to the local thermal gradient. permeability determination initial values for permeability are deﬁned based on laboratory measurements (table 1). after each simulation run, modeled and measured temperature and pressure values have been compared at indicated observation points. in case of poor matching (errors [10 %), permeability has been adjusted until satisfactory results have been achieved. beneath lake linau, simulation results showed locally strong discrepancies between modeled and measured pressure and temperature (errors [45 %). adjustment of permeability in geological inﬁltration rates into faults, or hydraulic heads did not lead to acceptable results. only the implementation of strong permeability anisotropy throughout whole depth, i.e., an additional fault, resulted in minimization of errors (0–7 %). implementation has been accomplished by mesh adaptation to ensure appropriate behavior around the fault. by this procedure, permeability anisotropies have been located and characterized in detail throughout the model. layers, in general, deﬁning a direction-dependent permeability improves the data ﬁt rather than using similar permeabilities in all directions. this is probably due to the fractures increasing the permeability mostly in vertical direction. porosity and thermal conductivity remained constant throughout simulation. variation in porosity is negligible because it would directly be reﬂected in permeability, while thermal conductivity differences would only affect conductive heat transport, which is not dominant in the lahendong area ( 1998;  2014). 123 100c measurementa 500borelog ofmodel

best ﬁt to the measured data changing the absolute and relative permeability in geological elements. relative permeability refers to different permeabilities in horizontal and vertical direction. as a main result, a blind fault has been recognized beneath lake linau, which has not been known from former studies. simulated pressure and temperature are measured at ﬁve selected observation points, which represent boreholes with available bore logs for pressure and temperature. details on data are given in fig. 6. the model with best data ﬁt, out of 370 different models, is considered to generate the ﬁnal model developed for lahendong. permeability distribution and identiﬁcation of a blind fault distribution of permeability patterns in the reservoir has been conceived comparing temperature and pressure data in several wells. especially beneath lake linau, closely located wells show high variations in temperature and pressure. a drop of 100 °c and 18 bar along 300 m distance has been observed between well lhd 24 and lhd 28. models ﬁrst showed high discrepancies between modeled and measured values in this area. however, after implementing another high anisotropic permeable structure between the observation points, models resulted in satisfactory results. the structure has ten times higher vertical environ earth sci (2016) 75:1088 permeability than horizontal permeability. this structure is assumed to be another fault zone located between two known faults with vertical dip and nw strike. this fault shows no trace at surface, because it is covered by lake linau. generally, modeled permeability distribution in the lahendong reservoir is direction-dependent and overprints the lithology. modeled permeability is generally higher than measured ones in the order of up to four magnitudes. this is due to fracture patterns, which are not detectable at core-sample scale. permeability patterns directly affect subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow and temperature and pressure distribution. permeability in the faulted zones and surroundings is lowest in the study area. especially the middle and ne fault, the shallow area beneath sw lake linau and the deep ne section of the ne fault show low permeabilities between 10-13 and 10-14 m2 (fig. 3). the area between the middle and ne fault, the deep section ne of the sw fault, the sw fault itself and the whole model area toward the sw and ne boundary show higher permeabilities of 10-10 and 10-12 m2 (fig. 3). permeability varies not only within the modeled area, but also in vertical and horizontal direction. in faults and the deep reservoir section in the ne, permeability is by a factor of 10 higher in the vertical direction than in the horizontal direction (fig. 3). in the areas between faults, permeability is in some parts by a factor of 10–100 lower in the vertical direction. in the rest of the model, vertical and horizontal permeability do not differ (fig. 3). fig. 3 final adapted permeability and anisotropy

high permeable fault zones. isobars drop following the natural hydraulic gradient from sw to ne. the sw section of the system shows higher pressures, which is caused by inﬁltration from higher elevations in the sw. some wells existing in this region are of artesian-type. overpressure releases through high permeable zones beneath lake linau and discharges toward surface. the pressure drop is up to 20 bars across the faults (fig. 4). temperature distribution temperature distribution along the lahendong geothermal reservoir suggests that convective heat transport is the dominating process in the reservoir rocks. isotherms generally follow the sw–ne oriented ﬂow pattern, the rise and the inﬁltration of ﬂuids. upwelling of isotherms between the faults veriﬁes water rise toward lake linau. inﬁltration of cold water causes down welling of isotherms particularly on the northeast section of the model. temperature is locally increased at the bottom of the model surrounding the pluton (fig. 4). subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow the absolute and horizontal/vertical permeability distribution controls local ﬂuid ﬂow in the lahendong reservoir. the general ﬂuid ﬂow, driven by the natural pressure gradient, is oriented from sw to ne. vertical inﬁltration occurs at faults at lake linau and at the sw boundary. discharge is across the ne model boundary (fig. 5). the more detailed ﬂow patterns can be observed with streamlines, which show a ﬂuid ﬂow along highly permeable areas. calculated streamlines describe particle ﬂow within the model domain. a forward calculation shows how inﬁltrating water at the sw model boundary distributes through the reservoir. the backward calculation shows the source of ﬂuid particles arriving at the ne model boundary (fig. 5). patterns show that hot groundwater ﬂows toward the faults beneath lake linau, where the ﬂuid ﬂow is disturbed by a rise in temperature and vertically high permeable layers. this causes a rise of groundwater in this model area (red forward streamlines in fig. 5). at the same time, cold water inﬁltrates into high permeable areas and distributes over the ne model domain (blue backward streamlines in fig. 5). it is clearly seen that the composition of the ne reservoir domain is dominated by coldwater inﬁltration into faults, while the production areas are characterized by hot water ﬂow (fig. 5). discussion investigation of subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow in geothermal reservoirs is crucial for sustainable exploitation avoiding drilling into less productive areas. subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow might be locally inﬂuenced by fault zones or physical 123\\x0c1088 page 8 of 11 environ earth sci (2016) 75:1088 fig. 5 model domain with calculated streamlines, in red: forward streamlines follow hydraulic gradient from sw model boundary towards ne, in blue: backward streamlines representing inﬁltrating cold water ﬂowing towards ne model boundary properties of water (i.e. viscosity). the inﬂuence of these parameters on the ﬂuid ﬂow has been investigated in lahendong geothermal reservoir using hydraulic–thermal simulations. simulation results show the detailed permeability distribution in the reservoir including location of an additional fault zone. matching of measured and simulated temperature and pressure has been used as a tool for resolving the permeability distribution. temperature and pressure have been iteratively determined at several observation points (fig. 2). generally, modeled values are in good agreement with observed ones (fig. 6). nevertheless, some observation points give slightly different values for both pressure and temperature (lhd 4 and lhd 7) or only temperature (lhd 24). this is probably due to the complicated ﬂow processes or strong small-scale structural variation in fractured and faulted areas. furthermore, density variations, which could have not been included into simulation due to high temperatures, could cause variation of ﬂuid pressure. however, the average deviation of simulated pressure and temperature is 1 %. implemented model parameters are porosity, permeability, and heat conductivity. from those parameters, only permeability has been tested in a speciﬁc range during simulation. the inﬂuence of porosity and heat conductivity on ﬂuid ﬂow is negligible due to dominating convective heat ﬂow ( 1998). values implemented in the model are based on measured permeabilities, which represent matrix permeability of rocks. the measured matrix permeability, representing permeability in horizontal direction, is 1.5 9 10-14 m2 on 123 average, which remains within typical permeability range for fractured igneous rocks (schoen 2004). permeability for volcanic breccias ranges typically between 3 9 10-15 and 5 9 10-12 m2 and tuff permeabilities range between 7 9 10-17 and 7 9 10-12 m2 (klavetter and peters 1987). in the wairakei geothermal ﬁeld, simulating the impermeable layers resulted in permeabilities of 10-18 and 10-14 m2, in horizontal and vertical axis, respectively (mercer and faust 1979). however, permeability in reservoir rocks might be locally increased due to fracture formation. it might also be decreased due to alteration and sealing in faults. in lahendong, modeled permeability can be up to four magnitudes higher than measured ones in faulted areas. this is caused by fractures, which are not detectable in core scale. moreover, in fault cores, it is by a factor of 10 higher in vertical direction than in horizontal direction. however, in areas between faults (fault gauge), permeability is in some parts by a factor of 10–100 lower in the vertical direction. adaptation of permeability ensures a ﬁt to measured temperature and pressure data. permeability in fractured areas is the main factor inﬂuencing subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow and temperature distribution in the lahendong reservoir area. subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow is driven by local hydraulic heads, which show high variations at different sections of the study area. consequently, convective heat distribution leads to high temperature variation along the reservoir. these phenomena are observed in lahendong as well as comparable ﬁelds. in new mexico, water level drops of 30–100 m are observed across (haneberg 1995). high several fault zones\\x0c123 environ earth sci (2016) 75:1088 page 9 of 11 1088 7 24 4 28 5 well name lhd 4 lhd 5 lhd 7 lhd 24 lhd 28

temperature drops and upwelling of isotherms indicate that fault zones control the ﬂuid ﬂow in the lake long and valentine ﬁelds, usa (hooper 1991). the analysis of ﬂuid pressure differences at the alpine fault, new zealand, allowed to characterize the change in permeability between hanging and footwall blocks ( 2012). in summary, high pressure or temperature gradients are indicators for ﬂuid barriers between observation points. in other words, reservoir sections of different properties are separated by horizontally less permeable faults. in lahendong, most signiﬁcant ﬂuid barriers are faults to the sw and to the ne of lake linau. across these barriers, the pressure drops up to 20 bars. a similar pattern has been measured in bore logs beneath lake linau, where no surface trace of a fault had been observed in former studies. however, only by implementing another fault, modeled and measured values could have been adapted. the recently identiﬁed fault zone beneath lake linau remains under lake water and therefore is only traceable by this kind of reservoir modeling. additionally to fault identiﬁcation, the internal structure of known fault zones has been understood in detail. the ne fault, i.e., shows a displacement at 2 km depth. the detailed trend has been understood by permeability adaptation in this area. due to low permeability in horizontal direction in the faults, ﬂuids propagate mostly vertically toward the hot springs at surface. it also allows surface water to inﬁltrate into the reservoir in case the pressure within the fault zone is low enough (fig. 5). this vertical ﬂuid movement eventually controls the temperature distribution in the reservoir. upward migration of deep hot water increases the temperature, while inﬁltration of cold surface water causes local drop of temperature. in summary, the most important factors inﬂuencing the reliability of numerical reservoir models are absolute and different horizontal and vertical permeability. however, a permeability adaptation has been done for each geological layer; the vertical permeability anomalies are overprinting those layers and are constraining the regional groundwater ﬂow. those permeabilities of fractures directly inﬂuence the productivity of the reservoir ( 2013). therefore, their permeability characteristics should be investigated in detail. in a previous study, a numerical model for the lahendong site has been set up in tough2 and aimed at forecasting the reservoir behavior during exploitation until the year 2036. with a production of 60 mwe, it predicts a pressure drop of 10 bars. however, the forecast results are uncertain due to lack of measured pressure draw down data (yani 2006). accordingly, the next steps of the presented study should include a realistic production and injection scenario in order reservoir exploitation. furthermore, chemical characteristics could be considered to achieve reliable production setups, because hydrochemical processes play an important role in the lahendong reservoir ( 2016). presented models from this study provide important information on ﬂuid ﬂow in the water-dominated lahendong reservoir. however, additional the two-phase ﬂow models of to support sustainable\\x0c1088 page 10 of 11 environ earth sci (2016) 75:1088 lahendong area are in progress to understand the inﬂuence of steam driven ﬂuid ﬂow in this high-temperature system. conclusion the primary focus of this study is to understand the inﬂuence of fault zones and permeability patterns on subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow in geothermal reservoirs. the ﬂuid ﬂow mainly depends on rock and fault zone permeability. these processes have been considered in numerical models, which simulate local temperature and pressure conditions. the initial reservoir conditions, which refers to the case before production starts. models are developed based on the conceptual models of the study area, which explain reservoir geometry, geological structures, temperature, and hydraulic conditions. temperature and pressure well-logs have been used for model calibration. the numerical models represent vertical and horizontal ﬂuid ﬂow is mainly controlled by fault permeability. this characteristic is used to simulate different reservoir sections, and vertical ﬂuid rise toward the surface. by stepwise adaptation of permeability ﬁelds, based on observed temperature and pressure gradients, an additional blind fault zone can be identiﬁed beneath lake linau. temperature and pressure signiﬁcantly drop across that ﬂuid barrier. this behavior has been observed in comparable ﬁelds in the usa as well. the overall shape of ﬂuid ﬂow direction trends in a sw–ne direction. main recharge occurs by inﬁltration of surface water into the faults, especially in the southwest and near to lake linau. discharge is enhanced in highly fractured areas toward lake linau. vertical permeability of faults allows ﬂuids rising toward the hot springs at surface. results show that permeability has to be considered for simulation of a geothermal system. the geothermal system is mainly controlled by ﬂuid ﬂow in fractures/faults depending on temperature and pressure conditions. the locally modiﬁed ﬂuid ﬂow can considerably inﬂuence the productivity of a geothermal ﬁeld. results also guide reservoir management in case of a potential for ﬁeld extension, as performed in lahendong. acknowledgments the authors acknowledge the continuous support within the team of the international center for geothermal research under the direction of e. huenges. thanks to

july 2016 ó springer-verlag berlin heidelberg 2016 abstract subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow of reservoirs in active tectonic regions is mainly controlled by permeability of fault zones. therefore, the characterization of fault zones is an important step toward performance assessment of a reservoir. the ﬂuid ﬂow is controlled also by pressure and temperature conditions. in this context, we simulated pressure and temperature fields to elaborate on the inﬂuence of permeability on subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow in the lahendong geothermal reservoir. thermal–hydraulic simulation is performed using a finite element approach. adjusting the permeability through 370 different cases, modeling results converged to the observed data within a misfit range of 0–7 %. the best fitting models identified a deep-seated fault that has previously not been traced at the surface. simulated temperature distribution suggests a prominent convective heat ﬂow, driven by an upward migrating and sw–ne oriented ﬂuid ﬂow. this hydraulic gradient causes a pressure drop along the reservoir. highpressure patterns are used to constrain recharge areas, in addition to infiltration measurements. discharge ﬂow occurs from sw to ne migrating also upward toward the hot springs. in that frame, thermal–hydraulic simulations identified previously unresolved subsurface faults, which & maren brehme brehme@gfz-potsdam.de 1

permeable faults \\x01 hydrogeology \\x01 fluid ﬂow \\x01 geothermal field management \\x01 reservoir engineering \\x01 pressure drop introduction it geothermal energy is an essential component to supply future energy demands. requires developing new geothermal sites and improving the performance of existing systems to satisfy continuously growing demand. the productivity of a geothermal field mainly depends on subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow, which in active tectonic regions is controlled by permeability of fault zones (moeck 2014). in that frame, the primary focus is on locating and characterizing faulted areas in geothermal fields. this study employs numerical modeling to allocate and quantify permeability anisotropies and discontinuities, e.g., faults, in order to understand their inﬂuence on subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow in geothermal reservoirs. numerical models have been increasingly used to understand the setup and productivity of geothermal systems. a general overview of geothermal models has been given by o’ (2001). additionally, there are several sites exemplifying similar characteristics as in lahendong. the underground movement of hot and cold ﬂuids has been modeled for geothermal fields in new zealand ( 2014). the kakkonda geothermal site, e.g., consists of two reservoirs at various depths with different ﬂuid properties. there, results from ﬂuid ﬂow analysis show the importance of fractures for ﬂuid transport enhancing the recharge or discharge in the reservoir 123\\x0c1088 page 2 of 11 environ earth sci (2016) 75:1088 ( 1995). generally, faults acting as preferential ﬂuid path ways significantly change the pressure and temperature field in the reservoir ( 2013). models for the seferihisar–balc¸ova field focus on the ﬂuid ﬂow inside of faults. results show an enhanced upward heat transport through ﬂuids from bottom of the geothermal system ( 2011). our test ground is the lahendong geothermal field located in sulawesi, indonesia. the field is owned and operated by p.t. pertamina geothermal energy and hosts a power plant with a production capacity of 80 mwe. there, geothermal exploration started in the early 1970s including geophysical and geohydrochemical approaches. it is a water-dominated magmatic structurally controlled system. faults generally act as across-fault ﬂuid barriers and alongfault ﬂuid conductors ( 2014). as a result, hot springs mainly appear on the top of vertically permeable faults at the surface. available numerous drilling and surface measurements allowed a detailed characterization of the geological and hydrogeological setting of the area (;  2011, 2013, 2014, 2016;  2013). the model presented here is developed for investigating subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow and the permeability distribution including the fault zones in the lahendong geothermal field. below, the geological structure of the field is presented followed by an introduction to the modeling approach. detailed investigation of subsurface permeability distribution is a crucial step for site selection and smart drilling strategies. the numerical simulations presented will provide insight into understanding the subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow considering the hydraulic conductivity of faults. it ensures productive as well as sustainable operation of geothermal fields avoiding risks, such as drilling into non-fractured or cold zones, and targeting highly corroding waters. although the target area is lahendong, the general workﬂow is applicable for other geothermal sites consisting of similar constraints. reservoir characterization hydrogeology the overall driving force for the ﬂuid ﬂow is the sw–ne oriented natural hydraulic gradient in the lahendong geothermal system. the direction of ﬂuid ﬂow varies through the geothermal site due to horizontal partitioning of the reservoir by relatively less permeable fault zones ( 2014). the basic sections are located in the  topographic map of the study area with geological features, water and rock sample locations, and model cross section 123\\x0cenviron earth sci (2016) 75:1088 page 3 of 11 1088 south, in the east, and beneath lake linau. beneath lake linau, the direction of ﬂuid ﬂow is slightly rotated to wsw–ene (). also, types of ﬂuid change from one section to another, e.g., an acidic highly saline-type beneath lake linau and a neutral low saline-type south and east of lake linau (). the impermeable structure across faults prevent the ﬂuids from diluting each other ( 2016). however, faults are rather permeable along the vertical axis, which allows recharge of the system through the faults. rainwater infiltrates at a fault in the sw, at mt. lengkoan, and creek water infiltrates into the normal faults at lake linau (). the hydrothermal system discharges into lake linau and toward the ne, as driven by the hydraulic gradient ( 2014). the fracture network along the area is characterized by strike slip faults and normal faults. the sinistral faults strike n 40° and steeply dip toward the se. left step over on the strike slip faults forms an extension basin in the central study area. normal faults at the extension basin strike nw and dip 70°–80° beneath lake linau ( 2014). lithology lahendong area is mainly characterized by pre-, postand tondano formation of plioto pleistocene age ( 2010). the rocks are typically andesite, volcanic breccia, and tuff. those types have been sampled from borehole cores and used to determine porosity, permeability, and thermal conductivity. effective porosity and matrix permeability have been analyzed using a cylindrical-shaped specimen with a dimension of 5 cm x 5 cm 9 2.5 cm oriented parallel to the coring ( 2016). thermal conductivity has been measured on plain sections of dried cores. the experimental setup consists of a gas permeameter for determining matrix permeability ( 2011), of an helium pycnometry for effective porosity measurements (johnson- 1994) and of an optical scanner for thermal conductivity measurements ( 1999). these parameters have been measured and averaged for the three rock types ( 2016; ). andesite has an effective porosity of 3.7 %, a permeability of 2.1 9 10-14 m2, and a thermal conductivity of 1.8 w m-1 k-1 (dry) or 2.2 w m-1 k-1 (saturated). tuff has a porosity of 7.7 % but the lowest permeability of 2.0 9 10-15 m2 of 1.6 w m-1 k-1 (saturated). volcanic breccia is a permeable layer with an effective porosity of 10.5 %, a permeability of 2.3 9 10-14 m2, and a thermal conductivity of 1.6 w m-1 k-1 (dry) or 2.5 w m-1 k-1 (saturated). reservoir

transport in saturated porous media are derived from conservation principles of linear momentum, mass, and energy (dhi-wasy 2009). details on the software and the parameterization can be found in diersch (2014). the model geometry is a 2d vertical sw–ne trending cross section extending 6 km in horizontal and 3 km in vertical direction. the direction of the profile has been selected to cover all relevant processes in the lahendong geothermal field: it cuts major faults and the production and injection wells, which are used for temperature and pressure calibration. furthermore, to the groundwater ﬂow direction, showing major ﬂuid ﬂow activities. the homogeneous and isotropic geological layers in the model are stratified nearly horizontally. faults in the middle of the model, striking perpendicular to the cross section, dip with 84° toward a cooling pluton beneath lake linau. details on structural and geological components of the modeled region have been presented in  (2014). is parallel it the numerical the mesh used for simulation in feflow consists of 45,264 nodes and 89,320 elements that are denser surrounding the faults because of expected gradients due to parameter contrasts. material properties of 123 elements are permeability, porosity, and thermal conductivity and set according to laboratory measurements (). however, properties of the faults and lake linau are slightly adapted to specific conditions. the definitions for the modeled grids along the faults are as follows: porosity is 30 % and thermal conductivity is 1.8 w m-1 k-1. corresponding grids for lake linau are defined by a porosity of 100 % and a thermal conductivity of 0.6 w m-1 k-1. the model simulates ﬂuid ﬂow and thermal transport in saturated media in steady state. initial values and boundary conditions fluid ﬂow boundary conditions in the model describe groundwater heads and recharge amounts (; ). the hydraulic head at the sw model boundary is 837 m and 500 m at the ne boundary. the sw hydraulic head represents infiltration of surface water into a fault, striking perpendicular to the model. hydraulic head at the ne border is adapted to borehole measurements in that area ( 2014). infiltration into the fault zones at lake linau is described by ﬂuid ﬂux boundary conditions. the quantity is 3.0 9 10-4 m s-1 the sw and 1.3 9 10-6 m s-1 at the ne fault distributed over 40 m fault width. groundwater recharge is set to 412 mm a-1 at the ne top surface (; ). fluid movement in for\\x0cthe model domain is constrained by no-ﬂow boundary at the bottom, recharge through the surrounding fault zones, and the low hydraulic heads in the ne model area. discharge of the system in the central study area is mainly toward lake linau and across the ne model boundary. initial hydraulic head for the whole model domain is 500 m. the heat is 116 °c km-1 at transport boundary conditions are time-invariant, fixed temperatures, and heat ﬂux (; ). thermal gradient the sw model boundary, and the temperature is constant 350 °c at the pluton. temperature of water infiltrating into faults and here mixing with shallow warm groundwater is 70 °c, while surface groundwater recharge is at 28 °c. temperature values are obtained from field and bore log measurements ( 2014). heat ﬂux is set to 100 mw m-2 at the bottom model boundary (; ). this value is fixed based on the studies from  (1998), nagao and uyeda (1995), and  (1998). initial temperature for the model domain is set as 116 °c km-1, according to the local thermal gradient. permeability determination initial values for permeability are defined based on laboratory measurements (). after each simulation run, modeled and measured temperature and pressure values have been compared at indicated observation points. in case of poor matching (errors [10 %), permeability has been adjusted until satisfactory results have been achieved. beneath lake linau, simulation results showed locally strong discrepancies between modeled and measured pressure and temperature (errors [45 %). adjustment of permeability in geological infiltration rates into faults, or hydraulic heads did not lead to acceptable results. only the implementation of strong permeability anisotropy throughout whole depth, i.e., an additional fault, resulted in minimization of errors (0–7 %). implementation has been accomplished by mesh adaptation to ensure appropriate behavior around the fault. by this procedure, permeability anisotropies have been located and characterized in detail throughout the model. layers, in general, defining a direction-dependent permeability improves the data fit rather than using similar permeabilities in all directions. this is probably due to the fractures increasing the permeability mostly in vertical direction. porosity and thermal conductivity remained constant throughout simulation. variation in porosity is negligible because it would directly be reﬂected in permeability, while thermal conductivity differences would only affect conductive heat transport, which is not dominant in the lahendong area ( 1998;  2014). 123 100c measurementa 500borelog ofmodel

to obtain the best fit to the measured data changing the absolute and relative permeability in geological elements. relative permeability refers to different permeabilities in horizontal and vertical direction. as a main result, a blind fault has been recognized beneath lake linau, which has not been known from former studies. simulated pressure and temperature are measured at five selected observation points, which represent boreholes with available bore logs for pressure and temperature. details on data are given in . the model with best data fit, out of 370 different models, is considered to generate the final model developed for lahendong. permeability distribution and identification of a blind fault distribution of permeability patterns in the reservoir has been conceived comparing temperature and pressure data in several wells. especially beneath lake linau, closely located wells show high variations in temperature and pressure. a drop of 100 °c and 18 bar along 300 m distance has been observed between well lhd 24 and lhd 28. models first showed high discrepancies between modeled and measured values in this area. however, after implementing another high anisotropic permeable structure between the observation points, models resulted in satisfactory results. the structure has ten times higher vertical environ earth sci (2016) 75:1088 permeability than horizontal permeability. this structure is assumed to be another fault zone located between two known faults with vertical dip and nw strike. this fault shows no trace at surface, because it is covered by lake linau. generally, modeled permeability distribution in the lahendong reservoir is direction-dependent and overprints the lithology. modeled permeability is generally higher than measured ones in the order of up to four magnitudes. this is due to fracture patterns, which are not detectable at core-sample scale. permeability patterns directly affect subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow and temperature and pressure distribution. permeability in the faulted zones and surroundings is lowest in the study area. especially the middle and ne fault, the shallow area beneath sw lake linau and the deep ne section of the ne fault show low permeabilities between 10-13 and 10-14 m2 (). the area between the middle and ne fault, the deep section ne of the sw fault, the sw fault itself and the whole model area toward the sw and ne boundary show higher permeabilities of 10-10 and 10-12 m2 (). permeability varies not only within the modeled area, but also in vertical and horizontal direction. in faults and the deep reservoir section in the ne, permeability is by a factor of 10 higher in the vertical direction than in the horizontal direction (). in the areas between faults, permeability is in some parts by a factor of 10–100 lower in the vertical direction. in the rest of the model, vertical and horizontal permeability do not differ ().  final adapted permeability and anisotropy distribution throughout

some wells existing in this region are of artesian-type. overpressure releases through high permeable zones beneath lake linau and discharges toward surface. the pressure drop is up to 20 bars across the faults (). temperature distribution temperature distribution along the lahendong geothermal reservoir suggests that convective heat transport is the dominating process in the reservoir rocks. isotherms generally follow the sw–ne oriented ﬂow pattern, the rise and the infiltration of ﬂuids. upwelling of isotherms between the faults verifies water rise toward lake linau. infiltration of cold water causes down welling of isotherms particularly on the northeast section of the model. temperature is locally increased at the bottom of the model surrounding the pluton (). subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow the absolute and horizontal/vertical permeability distribution controls local ﬂuid ﬂow in the lahendong reservoir. the general ﬂuid ﬂow, driven by the natural pressure gradient, is oriented from sw to ne. vertical infiltration occurs at faults at lake linau and at the sw boundary. discharge is across the ne model boundary (). the more detailed ﬂow patterns can be observed with streamlines, which show a ﬂuid ﬂow along highly permeable areas. calculated streamlines describe particle ﬂow within the model domain. a forward calculation shows how infiltrating water at the sw model boundary distributes through the reservoir. the backward calculation shows the source of ﬂuid particles arriving at the ne model boundary (). patterns show that hot groundwater ﬂows toward the faults beneath lake linau, where the ﬂuid ﬂow is disturbed by a rise in temperature and vertically high permeable layers. this causes a rise of groundwater in this model area (red forward streamlines in ). at the same time, cold water infiltrates into high permeable areas and distributes over the ne model domain (blue backward streamlines in ). it is clearly seen that the composition of the ne reservoir domain is dominated by coldwater infiltration into faults, while the production areas are characterized by hot water ﬂow (). discussion investigation of subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow in geothermal reservoirs is crucial for sustainable exploitation avoiding drilling into less productive areas. subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow might be locally inﬂuenced by fault zones or physical 123\\x0c1088 page 8 of 11 environ earth sci

infiltrating cold water ﬂowing towards ne model boundary properties of water (i.e. viscosity). the inﬂuence of these parameters on the ﬂuid ﬂow has been investigated in lahendong geothermal reservoir using hydraulic–thermal simulations. simulation results show the detailed permeability distribution in the reservoir including location of an additional fault zone. matching of measured and simulated temperature and pressure has been used as a tool for resolving the permeability distribution. temperature and pressure have been iteratively determined at several observation points (). generally, modeled values are in good agreement with observed ones (). nevertheless, some observation points give slightly different values for both pressure and temperature (lhd 4 and lhd 7) or only temperature (lhd 24). this is probably due to the complicated ﬂow processes or strong small-scale structural variation in fractured and faulted areas. furthermore, density variations, which could have not been included into simulation due to high temperatures, could cause variation of ﬂuid pressure. however, the average deviation of simulated pressure and temperature is 1 %. implemented model parameters are porosity, permeability, and heat conductivity. from those parameters, only permeability has been tested in a specific range during simulation. the inﬂuence of porosity and heat conductivity on ﬂuid ﬂow is negligible due to dominating convective heat ﬂow ( 1998). values implemented in the model are based on measured permeabilities, which represent matrix permeability of rocks. the measured matrix permeability, representing permeability in horizontal direction, is 1.5 9 10-14 m2 on 123 average, which remains within typical permeability range for fractured igneous rocks (schoen 2004). permeability for volcanic breccias ranges typically between 3 9 10-15 and 5 9 10-12 m2 and tuff permeabilities range between 7 9 10-17 and 7 9 10-12 m2 (klavetter and peters 1987). in the wairakei geothermal field, simulating the impermeable layers resulted in permeabilities of 10-18 and 10-14 m2, in horizontal and vertical axis, respectively (mercer and faust 1979). however, permeability in reservoir rocks might be locally increased due to fracture formation. it might also be decreased due to alteration and sealing in faults. in lahendong, modeled permeability can be up to four magnitudes higher than measured ones in faulted areas. this is caused by fractures, which are not detectable in core scale. moreover, in fault cores, it is by a factor of 10 higher in vertical direction than in horizontal direction. however, in areas between faults (fault gauge), permeability is in some parts by a factor of 10–100 lower in the vertical direction. adaptation of permeability ensures a fit to measured temperature and pressure data. permeability in fractured areas is the main factor inﬂuencing subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow and temperature distribution in the lahendong reservoir area. subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow is driven by local hydraulic heads, which show high variations at different sections of the study area. consequently, convective heat distribution leads to high temperature variation along the reservoir. these phenomena are observed in lahendong as well as comparable fields. in new mexico, water level drops of 30–100 m are observed across (haneberg 1995). high several

measured temperature and pressure at selected observation points. well specifications and measured data from  (2014) temperature drops and upwelling of isotherms indicate that fault zones control the ﬂuid ﬂow in the lake long and valentine fields, usa (hooper 1991). the analysis of ﬂuid pressure differences at the alpine fault, new zealand, allowed to characterize the change in permeability between hanging and footwall blocks ( 2012). in summary, high pressure or temperature gradients are indicators for ﬂuid barriers between observation points. in other words, reservoir sections of different properties are separated by horizontally less permeable faults. in lahendong, most significant ﬂuid barriers are faults to the sw and to the ne of lake linau. across these barriers, the pressure drops up to 20 bars. a similar pattern has been measured in bore logs beneath lake linau, where no surface trace of a fault had been observed in former studies. however, only by implementing another fault, modeled and measured values could have been adapted. the recently identified fault zone beneath lake linau remains under lake water and therefore is only traceable by this kind of reservoir modeling. additionally to fault identification, the internal structure of known fault zones has been understood in detail. the ne fault, i.e., shows a displacement at 2 km depth. the detailed trend has been understood by permeability adaptation in this area. due to low permeability in horizontal direction in the faults, ﬂuids propagate mostly vertically toward the hot springs at surface. it also allows surface water to infiltrate into the reservoir in case the pressure within the fault zone is low enough (). this vertical ﬂuid movement eventually controls the temperature distribution in the reservoir. upward migration of deep hot water increases the temperature, while infiltration of cold surface water causes local drop of temperature. in summary, the most important factors inﬂuencing the reliability of numerical reservoir models are absolute and different horizontal and vertical permeability. however, a permeability adaptation has been done for each geological layer; the vertical permeability anomalies are overprinting those layers and are constraining the regional groundwater ﬂow. those permeabilities of fractures directly inﬂuence the productivity of the reservoir ( 2013). therefore, their permeability characteristics should be investigated in detail. in a previous study, a numerical model for the lahendong site has been set up in tough2 and aimed at forecasting the reservoir behavior during exploitation until the year 2036. with a production of 60 mwe, it predicts a pressure drop of 10 bars. however, the forecast results are uncertain due to lack of measured pressure draw down data (yani 2006). accordingly, the next steps of the presented study should include a realistic production and injection scenario in order reservoir exploitation. furthermore, chemical characteristics could be considered to achieve reliable production setups, because hydrochemical processes play an important role in the lahendong reservoir ( 2016). presented models from this study provide important information on ﬂuid ﬂow in the water-dominated lahendong reservoir. however, additional the two-phase ﬂow models of to support sustainable\\x0c1088 page 10 of 11 environ earth sci (2016) 75:1088 lahendong area are in progress to understand the inﬂuence of steam driven ﬂuid ﬂow in this high-temperature system. conclusion the primary focus of this study is to understand the inﬂuence of fault zones and permeability patterns on subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow in geothermal reservoirs. the ﬂuid ﬂow mainly depends on rock and fault zone permeability. these processes have been considered in numerical models, which simulate local temperature and pressure conditions. the initial reservoir conditions, which refers to the case before production starts. models are developed based on the conceptual models of the study area, which explain reservoir geometry, geological structures, temperature, and hydraulic conditions. temperature and pressure well-logs have been used for model calibration. the numerical models represent vertical and horizontal ﬂuid ﬂow is mainly controlled by fault permeability. this characteristic is used to simulate different reservoir sections, and vertical ﬂuid rise toward the surface. by stepwise adaptation of permeability fields, based on observed temperature and pressure gradients, an additional blind fault zone can be identified beneath lake linau. temperature and pressure significantly drop across that ﬂuid barrier. this behavior has been observed in comparable fields in the usa as well. the overall shape of ﬂuid ﬂow direction trends in a sw–ne direction. main recharge occurs by infiltration of surface water into the faults, especially in the southwest and near to lake linau. discharge is enhanced in highly fractured areas toward lake linau. vertical permeability of faults allows ﬂuids rising toward the hot springs at surface. results show that permeability has to be considered for simulation of a geothermal system. the geothermal system is mainly controlled by ﬂuid ﬂow in fractures/faults depending on temperature and pressure conditions. the locally modified ﬂuid ﬂow can considerably inﬂuence the productivity of a geothermal field. results also guide reservoir management in case of a potential for field extension, as performed in lahendong. acknowledgments the authors acknowledge the continuous support within

july 2016 ó springer-verlag berlin heidelberg 2016 abstract subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow of reservoirs in active tectonic regions is mainly controlled by permeability of fault zones. therefore, the characterization of fault zones is an important step toward performance assessment of a reservoir. the ﬂuid ﬂow is controlled also by pressure and temperature conditions. in this context, we simulated pressure and temperature fields to elaborate on the inﬂuence of permeability on subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow in the lahendong geothermal reservoir. thermal–hydraulic simulation is performed using a finite element approach. adjusting the permeability through 370 different cases, modeling results converged to the observed data within a misfit range of 0–7 %. the best fitting models identified a deep-seated fault that has previously not been traced at the surface. simulated temperature distribution suggests a prominent convective heat ﬂow, driven by an upward migrating and sw–ne oriented ﬂuid ﬂow. this hydraulic gradient causes a pressure drop along the reservoir. highpressure patterns are used to constrain recharge areas, in addition to infiltration measurements. discharge ﬂow occurs from sw to ne migrating also upward toward the hot springs. in that frame, thermal–hydraulic simulations identified previously unresolved subsurface faults, which & maren brehme  1 helmholtz centre potsdam

demands. requires developing new geothermal sites and improving the performance of existing systems to satisfy continuously growing demand. the productivity of a geothermal field mainly depends on subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow, which in active tectonic regions is controlled by permeability of fault zones (moeck 2014). in that frame, the primary focus is on locating and characterizing faulted areas in geothermal fields. this study employs numerical modeling to allocate and quantify permeability anisotropies and discontinuities, e.g., faults, in order to understand their inﬂuence on subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow in geothermal reservoirs. numerical models have been increasingly used to understand the setup and productivity of geothermal systems. a general overview of geothermal models has been given by o’ (2001). additionally, there are several sites exemplifying similar characteristics as in lahendong. the underground movement of hot and cold ﬂuids has been modeled for geothermal fields in new zealand ( 2014). the kakkonda geothermal site, e.g., consists of two reservoirs at various depths with different ﬂuid properties. there, results from ﬂuid ﬂow analysis show the importance of fractures for ﬂuid transport enhancing the recharge or discharge in the reservoir 123\\x0c1088 page 2 of 11 environ earth sci (2016) 75:1088 ( 1995). generally, faults acting as preferential ﬂuid path ways significantly change the pressure and temperature field in the reservoir ( 2013). models for the seferihisar–balc¸ova field focus on the ﬂuid ﬂow inside of faults. results show an enhanced upward heat transport through ﬂuids from bottom of the geothermal system ( 2011). our test ground is the lahendong geothermal field located in sulawesi, indonesia. the field is owned and operated by p.t. pertamina geothermal energy and hosts a power plant with a production capacity of 80 mwe. there, geothermal exploration started in the early 1970s including geophysical and geohydrochemical approaches. it is a water-dominated magmatic structurally controlled system. faults generally act as across-fault ﬂuid barriers and alongfault ﬂuid conductors ( 2014). as a result, hot springs mainly appear on the top of vertically permeable faults at the surface. available numerous drilling and surface measurements allowed a detailed characterization of the geological and hydrogeological setting of the area (;  2011, 2013, 2014, 2016;  2013). the model presented here is developed for investigating subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow and the permeability distribution including the fault zones in the lahendong geothermal field. below, the geological structure of the field is presented followed by an introduction to the modeling approach. detailed investigation of subsurface permeability distribution is a crucial step for site selection and smart drilling strategies. the numerical simulations presented will provide insight into understanding the subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow considering the hydraulic conductivity of faults. it ensures productive as well as sustainable operation of geothermal fields avoiding risks, such as drilling into non-fractured or cold zones, and targeting highly corroding waters. although the target area is lahendong, the general workﬂow is applicable for other geothermal sites consisting of similar constraints. reservoir characterization hydrogeology the overall driving force for the ﬂuid ﬂow is the sw–ne oriented natural hydraulic gradient in the lahendong geothermal system. the direction of ﬂuid ﬂow varies through the geothermal site due to horizontal partitioning of the reservoir by relatively less permeable fault zones ( 2014). the basic sections are located in the  topographic map of the study area with geological features, water and rock sample locations, and model cross section 123\\x0cenviron earth sci (2016) 75:1088 page 3 of 11 1088 south, in the east, and beneath lake linau. beneath lake linau, the direction of ﬂuid ﬂow is slightly rotated to wsw–ene (). also, types of ﬂuid change from one section to another, e.g., an acidic highly saline-type beneath lake linau and a neutral low saline-type south and east of lake linau (). the impermeable structure across faults prevent the ﬂuids from diluting each other ( 2016). however, faults are rather permeable along the vertical axis, which allows recharge of the system through the faults. rainwater infiltrates at a fault in the sw, at mt. lengkoan, and creek water infiltrates into the normal faults at lake linau (). the hydrothermal system discharges into lake linau and toward the ne, as driven by the hydraulic gradient ( 2014). the fracture network along the area is characterized by strike slip faults and normal faults. the sinistral faults strike n 40° and steeply dip toward the se. left step over on the strike slip faults forms an extension basin in the central study area. normal faults at the extension basin strike nw and dip 70°–80° beneath lake linau ( 2014). lithology lahendong area is mainly characterized by pre-, postand tondano formation of plioto pleistocene age ( 2010). the rocks are typically andesite, volcanic breccia, and tuff. those types have been sampled from borehole cores and used to determine porosity, permeability, and thermal conductivity. effective porosity and matrix permeability have been analyzed using a cylindrical-shaped specimen with a dimension of 5 cm x 5 cm 9 2.5 cm oriented parallel to the coring ( 2016). thermal conductivity has been measured on plain sections of dried cores. the experimental setup consists of a gas permeameter for determining matrix permeability ( 2011), of an helium pycnometry for effective porosity measurements (johnson- 1994) and of an optical scanner for thermal conductivity measurements ( 1999). these parameters have been measured and averaged for the three rock types ( 2016; ). andesite has an effective porosity of 3.7 %, a permeability of 2.1 9 10-14 m2, and a thermal conductivity of 1.8 w m-1 k-1 (dry) or 2.2 w m-1 k-1 (saturated). tuff has a porosity of 7.7 % but the lowest permeability of 2.0 9 10-15 m2 of 1.6 w m-1 k-1 (saturated). volcanic breccia is a permeable layer with an effective porosity of 10.5 %, a permeability of 2.3 9 10-14 m2, and a thermal conductivity of 1.6 w m-1 k-1 (dry) or 2.5 w m-1 k-1 (saturated). reservoir rocks reﬂect generally low matrix

2.0 9 10-15 element software feflow is used to model pressuredriven and thermally induced ﬂuid ﬂow including viscosity changes. governing equations for ﬂuid ﬂow and heat transport in saturated porous media are derived from conservation principles of linear momentum, mass, and energy (dhi-wasy 2009). details on the software and the parameterization can be found in diersch (2014). the model geometry is a 2d vertical sw–ne trending cross section extending 6 km in horizontal and 3 km in vertical direction. the direction of the profile has been selected to cover all relevant processes in the lahendong geothermal field: it cuts major faults and the production and injection wells, which are used for temperature and pressure calibration. furthermore, to the groundwater ﬂow direction, showing major ﬂuid ﬂow activities. the homogeneous and isotropic geological layers in the model are stratified nearly horizontally. faults in the middle of the model, striking perpendicular to the cross section, dip with 84° toward a cooling pluton beneath lake linau. details on structural and geological components of the modeled region have been presented in  (2014). is parallel it the numerical the mesh used for simulation in feflow consists of 45,264 nodes and 89,320 elements that are denser surrounding the faults because of expected gradients due to parameter contrasts. material properties of 123 elements are permeability, porosity, and thermal conductivity and set according to laboratory measurements (). however, properties of the faults and lake linau are slightly adapted to specific conditions. the definitions for the modeled grids along the faults are as follows: porosity is 30 % and thermal conductivity is 1.8 w m-1 k-1. corresponding grids for lake linau are defined by a porosity of 100 % and a thermal conductivity of 0.6 w m-1 k-1. the model simulates ﬂuid ﬂow and thermal transport in saturated media in steady state. initial values and boundary conditions fluid ﬂow boundary conditions in the model describe groundwater heads and recharge amounts (; ). the hydraulic head at the sw model boundary is 837 m and 500 m at the ne boundary. the sw hydraulic head represents infiltration of surface water into a fault, striking perpendicular to the model. hydraulic head at the ne border is adapted to borehole measurements in that area ( 2014). infiltration into the fault zones at lake linau is described by ﬂuid ﬂux boundary conditions. the quantity is 3.0 9 10-4 m s-1 the sw and 1.3 9 10-6 m s-1 at the ne fault distributed over 40 m fault width. groundwater recharge is set to 412 mm a-1 at the ne top surface (; ). fluid movement in for\\x0cthe model domain is constrained by no-ﬂow boundary at the bottom, recharge through the surrounding fault zones, and the low hydraulic heads in the ne model area. discharge of the system in the central study area is mainly toward lake linau and across the ne model boundary. initial hydraulic head for the whole model domain is 500 m. the heat is 116 °c km-1 at transport boundary conditions are time-invariant, fixed temperatures, and heat ﬂux (; ). thermal gradient the sw model boundary, and the temperature is constant 350 °c at the pluton. temperature of water infiltrating into faults and here mixing with shallow warm groundwater is 70 °c, while surface groundwater recharge is at 28 °c. temperature values are obtained from field and bore log measurements ( 2014). heat ﬂux is set to 100 mw m-2 at the bottom model boundary (; ). this value is fixed based on the studies from  (1998), nagao and uyeda (1995), and  (1998). initial temperature for the model domain is set as 116 °c km-1, according to the local thermal gradient. permeability determination initial values for permeability are defined based on laboratory measurements (). after each simulation run, modeled and measured temperature and pressure values have been compared at indicated observation points. in case of poor matching (errors [10 %), permeability has been adjusted until satisfactory results have been achieved. beneath lake linau, simulation results showed locally strong discrepancies between modeled and measured pressure and temperature (errors [45 %). adjustment of permeability in geological infiltration rates into faults, or hydraulic heads did not lead to acceptable results. only the implementation of strong permeability anisotropy throughout whole depth, i.e., an additional fault, resulted in minimization of errors (0–7 %). implementation has been accomplished by mesh adaptation to ensure appropriate behavior around the fault. by this procedure, permeability anisotropies have been located and characterized in detail throughout the model. layers, in general, defining a direction-dependent permeability improves the data fit rather than using similar permeabilities in all directions. this is probably due to the fractures increasing the permeability mostly in vertical direction. porosity and thermal conductivity remained constant throughout simulation. variation in porosity is negligible because it would directly be reﬂected in permeability, while thermal conductivity differences would only affect conductive heat transport, which is not dominant in the lahendong area ( 1998;  2014). 123 100c measurementa 500borelog ofmodel bottom boundary nemodel

a main result, a blind fault has been recognized beneath lake linau, which has not been known from former studies. simulated pressure and temperature are measured at five selected observation points, which represent boreholes with available bore logs for pressure and temperature. details on data are given in . the model with best data fit, out of 370 different models, is considered to generate the final model developed for lahendong. permeability distribution and identification of a blind fault distribution of permeability patterns in the reservoir has been conceived comparing temperature and pressure data in several wells. especially beneath lake linau, closely located wells show high variations in temperature and pressure. a drop of 100 °c and 18 bar along 300 m distance has been observed between well lhd 24 and lhd 28. models first showed high discrepancies between modeled and measured values in this area. however, after implementing another high anisotropic permeable structure between the observation points, models resulted in satisfactory results. the structure has ten times higher vertical environ earth sci (2016) 75:1088 permeability than horizontal permeability. this structure is assumed to be another fault zone located between two known faults with vertical dip and nw strike. this fault shows no trace at surface, because it is covered by lake linau. generally, modeled permeability distribution in the lahendong reservoir is direction-dependent and overprints the lithology. modeled permeability is generally higher than measured ones in the order of up to four magnitudes. this is due to fracture patterns, which are not detectable at core-sample scale. permeability patterns directly affect subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow and temperature and pressure distribution. permeability in the faulted zones and surroundings is lowest in the study area. especially the middle and ne fault, the shallow area beneath sw lake linau and the deep ne section of the ne fault show low permeabilities between 10-13 and 10-14 m2 (). the area between the middle and ne fault, the deep section ne of the sw fault, the sw fault itself and the whole model area toward the sw and ne boundary show higher permeabilities of 10-10 and 10-12 m2 (). permeability varies not only within the modeled area, but also in vertical and horizontal direction. in faults and the deep reservoir section in the ne, permeability is by a factor of 10 higher in the vertical direction than in the horizontal direction (). in the areas between faults, permeability is in some parts by a factor of 10–100 lower in the vertical direction. in the rest of the model, vertical and horizontal permeability do not differ ().  final adapted permeability and anisotropy distribution throughout

some wells existing in this region are of artesian-type. overpressure releases through high permeable zones beneath lake linau and discharges toward surface. the pressure drop is up to 20 bars across the faults (). temperature distribution temperature distribution along the lahendong geothermal reservoir suggests that convective heat transport is the dominating process in the reservoir rocks. isotherms generally follow the sw–ne oriented ﬂow pattern, the rise and the infiltration of ﬂuids. upwelling of isotherms between the faults verifies water rise toward lake linau. infiltration of cold water causes down welling of isotherms particularly on the northeast section of the model. temperature is locally increased at the bottom of the model surrounding the pluton (). subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow the absolute and horizontal/vertical permeability distribution controls local ﬂuid ﬂow in the lahendong reservoir. the general ﬂuid ﬂow, driven by the natural pressure gradient, is oriented from sw to ne. vertical infiltration occurs at faults at lake linau and at the sw boundary. discharge is across the ne model boundary (). the more detailed ﬂow patterns can be observed with streamlines, which show a ﬂuid ﬂow along highly permeable areas. calculated streamlines describe particle ﬂow within the model domain. a forward calculation shows how infiltrating water at the sw model boundary distributes through the reservoir. the backward calculation shows the source of ﬂuid particles arriving at the ne model boundary (). patterns show that hot groundwater ﬂows toward the faults beneath lake linau, where the ﬂuid ﬂow is disturbed by a rise in temperature and vertically high permeable layers. this causes a rise of groundwater in this model area (red forward streamlines in ). at the same time, cold water infiltrates into high permeable areas and distributes over the ne model domain (blue backward streamlines in ). it is clearly seen that the composition of the ne reservoir domain is dominated by coldwater infiltration into faults, while the production areas are characterized by hot water ﬂow (). discussion investigation of subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow in geothermal reservoirs is crucial for sustainable exploitation avoiding drilling into less productive areas. subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow might be locally inﬂuenced by fault zones or physical 123\\x0c1088 page 8 of 11 environ earth sci

infiltrating cold water ﬂowing towards ne model boundary properties of water (i.e. viscosity). the inﬂuence of these parameters on the ﬂuid ﬂow has been investigated in lahendong geothermal reservoir using hydraulic–thermal simulations. simulation results show the detailed permeability distribution in the reservoir including location of an additional fault zone. matching of measured and simulated temperature and pressure has been used as a tool for resolving the permeability distribution. temperature and pressure have been iteratively determined at several observation points (). generally, modeled values are in good agreement with observed ones (). nevertheless, some observation points give slightly different values for both pressure and temperature (lhd 4 and lhd 7) or only temperature (lhd 24). this is probably due to the complicated ﬂow processes or strong small-scale structural variation in fractured and faulted areas. furthermore, density variations, which could have not been included into simulation due to high temperatures, could cause variation of ﬂuid pressure. however, the average deviation of simulated pressure and temperature is 1 %. implemented model parameters are porosity, permeability, and heat conductivity. from those parameters, only permeability has been tested in a specific range during simulation. the inﬂuence of porosity and heat conductivity on ﬂuid ﬂow is negligible due to dominating convective heat ﬂow ( 1998). values implemented in the model are based on measured permeabilities, which represent matrix permeability of rocks. the measured matrix permeability, representing permeability in horizontal direction, is 1.5 9 10-14 m2 on 123 average, which remains within typical permeability range for fractured igneous rocks (schoen 2004). permeability for volcanic breccias ranges typically between 3 9 10-15 and 5 9 10-12 m2 and tuff permeabilities range between 7 9 10-17 and 7 9 10-12 m2 (klavetter and peters 1987). in the wairakei geothermal field, simulating the impermeable layers resulted in permeabilities of 10-18 and 10-14 m2, in horizontal and vertical axis, respectively (mercer and faust 1979). however, permeability in reservoir rocks might be locally increased due to fracture formation. it might also be decreased due to alteration and sealing in faults. in lahendong, modeled permeability can be up to four magnitudes higher than measured ones in faulted areas. this is caused by fractures, which are not detectable in core scale. moreover, in fault cores, it is by a factor of 10 higher in vertical direction than in horizontal direction. however, in areas between faults (fault gauge), permeability is in some parts by a factor of 10–100 lower in the vertical direction. adaptation of permeability ensures a fit to measured temperature and pressure data. permeability in fractured areas is the main factor inﬂuencing subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow and temperature distribution in the lahendong reservoir area. subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow is driven by local hydraulic heads, which show high variations at different sections of the study area. consequently, convective heat distribution leads to high temperature variation along the reservoir. these phenomena are observed in lahendong as well as comparable fields. in new mexico, water level drops of 30–100 m are observed across (haneberg 1995). high several

measured temperature and pressure at selected observation points. well specifications and measured data from  (2014) temperature drops and upwelling of isotherms indicate that fault zones control the ﬂuid ﬂow in the lake long and valentine fields, usa (hooper 1991). the analysis of ﬂuid pressure differences at the alpine fault, new zealand, allowed to characterize the change in permeability between hanging and footwall blocks ( 2012). in summary, high pressure or temperature gradients are indicators for ﬂuid barriers between observation points. in other words, reservoir sections of different properties are separated by horizontally less permeable faults. in lahendong, most significant ﬂuid barriers are faults to the sw and to the ne of lake linau. across these barriers, the pressure drops up to 20 bars. a similar pattern has been measured in bore logs beneath lake linau, where no surface trace of a fault had been observed in former studies. however, only by implementing another fault, modeled and measured values could have been adapted. the recently identified fault zone beneath lake linau remains under lake water and therefore is only traceable by this kind of reservoir modeling. additionally to fault identification, the internal structure of known fault zones has been understood in detail. the ne fault, i.e., shows a displacement at 2 km depth. the detailed trend has been understood by permeability adaptation in this area. due to low permeability in horizontal direction in the faults, ﬂuids propagate mostly vertically toward the hot springs at surface. it also allows surface water to infiltrate into the reservoir in case the pressure within the fault zone is low enough (). this vertical ﬂuid movement eventually controls the temperature distribution in the reservoir. upward migration of deep hot water increases the temperature, while infiltration of cold surface water causes local drop of temperature. in summary, the most important factors inﬂuencing the reliability of numerical reservoir models are absolute and different horizontal and vertical permeability. however, a permeability adaptation has been done for each geological layer; the vertical permeability anomalies are overprinting those layers and are constraining the regional groundwater ﬂow. those permeabilities of fractures directly inﬂuence the productivity of the reservoir ( 2013). therefore, their permeability characteristics should be investigated in detail. in a previous study, a numerical model for the lahendong site has been set up in tough2 and aimed at forecasting the reservoir behavior during exploitation until the year 2036. with a production of 60 mwe, it predicts a pressure drop of 10 bars. however, the forecast results are uncertain due to lack of measured pressure draw down data (yani 2006). accordingly, the next steps of the presented study should include a realistic production and injection scenario in order reservoir exploitation. furthermore, chemical characteristics could be considered to achieve reliable production setups, because hydrochemical processes play an important role in the lahendong reservoir ( 2016). presented models from this study provide important information on ﬂuid ﬂow in the water-dominated lahendong reservoir. however, additional the two-phase ﬂow models of to support sustainable\\x0c1088 page 10 of 11 environ earth sci (2016) 75:1088 lahendong area are in progress to understand the inﬂuence of steam driven ﬂuid ﬂow in this high-temperature system. conclusion the primary focus of this study is to understand the inﬂuence of fault zones and permeability patterns on subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow in geothermal reservoirs. the ﬂuid ﬂow mainly depends on rock and fault zone permeability. these processes have been considered in numerical models, which simulate local temperature and pressure conditions. the initial reservoir conditions, which refers to the case before production starts. models are developed based on the conceptual models of the study area, which explain reservoir geometry, geological structures, temperature, and hydraulic conditions. temperature and pressure well-logs have been used for model calibration. the numerical models represent vertical and horizontal ﬂuid ﬂow is mainly controlled by fault permeability. this characteristic is used to simulate different reservoir sections, and vertical ﬂuid rise toward the surface. by stepwise adaptation of permeability fields, based on observed temperature and pressure gradients, an additional blind fault zone can be identified beneath lake linau. temperature and pressure significantly drop across that ﬂuid barrier. this behavior has been observed in comparable fields in the usa as well. the overall shape of ﬂuid ﬂow direction trends in a sw–ne direction. main recharge occurs by infiltration of surface water into the faults, especially in the southwest and near to lake linau. discharge is enhanced in highly fractured areas toward lake linau. vertical permeability of faults allows ﬂuids rising toward the hot springs at surface. results show that permeability has to be considered for simulation of a geothermal system. the geothermal system is mainly controlled by ﬂuid ﬂow in fractures/faults depending on temperature and pressure conditions. the locally modified ﬂuid ﬂow can considerably inﬂuence the productivity of a geothermal field. results also guide reservoir management in case of a potential for field extension, as performed in lahendong. acknowledgments the authors acknowledge the continuous support within

july 2016 ó springer-verlag berlin heidelberg 2016 abstract subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow of reservoirs in active tectonic regions is mainly controlled by permeability of fault zones. therefore, the characterization of fault zones is an important step toward performance assessment of a reservoir. the ﬂuid ﬂow is controlled also by pressure and temperature conditions. in this context, we simulated pressure and temperature fields to elaborate on the inﬂuence of permeability on subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow in the lahendong geothermal reservoir. thermal–hydraulic simulation is performed using a finite element approach. adjusting the permeability through 370 different cases, modeling results converged to the observed data within a misfit range of 0–7 %. the best fitting models identified a deep-seated fault that has previously not been traced at the surface. simulated temperature distribution suggests a prominent convective heat ﬂow, driven by an upward migrating and sw–ne oriented ﬂuid ﬂow. this hydraulic gradient causes a pressure drop along the reservoir. highpressure patterns are used to constrain recharge areas, in addition to infiltration measurements. discharge ﬂow occurs from sw to ne migrating also upward toward the hot springs. in that frame, thermal–hydraulic simulations identified previously unresolved subsurface faults, which & maren brehme  1 helmholtz centre potsdam

demands. requires developing new geothermal sites and improving the performance of existing systems to satisfy continuously growing demand. the productivity of a geothermal field mainly depends on subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow, which in active tectonic regions is controlled by permeability of fault zones (moeck 2014). in that frame, the primary focus is on locating and characterizing faulted areas in geothermal fields. this study employs numerical modeling to allocate and quantify permeability anisotropies and discontinuities, e.g., faults, in order to understand their inﬂuence on subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow in geothermal reservoirs. numerical models have been increasingly used to understand the setup and productivity of geothermal systems. a general overview of geothermal models has been given by o’ (2001). additionally, there are several sites exemplifying similar characteristics as in lahendong. the underground movement of hot and cold ﬂuids has been modeled for geothermal fields in new zealand ( 2014). the kakkonda geothermal site, e.g., consists of two reservoirs at various depths with different ﬂuid properties. there, results from ﬂuid ﬂow analysis show the importance of fractures for ﬂuid transport enhancing the recharge or discharge in the reservoir 123\\x0c1088 page 2 of 11 environ earth sci (2016) 75:1088 ( 1995). generally, faults acting as preferential ﬂuid path ways significantly change the pressure and temperature field in the reservoir ( 2013). models for the seferihisar–balc¸ova field focus on the ﬂuid ﬂow inside of faults. results show an enhanced upward heat transport through ﬂuids from bottom of the geothermal system ( 2011). our test ground is the lahendong geothermal field located in sulawesi, indonesia. the field is owned and operated by p.t. pertamina geothermal energy and hosts a power plant with a production capacity of 80 mwe. there, geothermal exploration started in the early 1970s including geophysical and geohydrochemical approaches. it is a water-dominated magmatic structurally controlled system. faults generally act as across-fault ﬂuid barriers and alongfault ﬂuid conductors ( 2014). as a result, hot springs mainly appear on the top of vertically permeable faults at the surface. available numerous drilling and surface measurements allowed a detailed characterization of the geological and hydrogeological setting of the area (;  2011, 2013, 2014, 2016;  2013). the model presented here is developed for investigating subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow and the permeability distribution including the fault zones in the lahendong geothermal field. below, the geological structure of the field is presented followed by an introduction to the modeling approach. detailed investigation of subsurface permeability distribution is a crucial step for site selection and smart drilling strategies. the numerical simulations presented will provide insight into understanding the subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow considering the hydraulic conductivity of faults. it ensures productive as well as sustainable operation of geothermal fields avoiding risks, such as drilling into non-fractured or cold zones, and targeting highly corroding waters. although the target area is lahendong, the general workﬂow is applicable for other geothermal sites consisting of similar constraints. reservoir characterization hydrogeology the overall driving force for the ﬂuid ﬂow is the sw–ne oriented natural hydraulic gradient in the lahendong geothermal system. the direction of ﬂuid ﬂow varies through the geothermal site due to horizontal partitioning of the reservoir by relatively less permeable fault zones ( 2014). the basic sections are located in the  topographic map of the study area with geological features, water and rock sample locations, and model cross section 123\\x0cenviron earth sci (2016) 75:1088 page 3 of 11 1088 south, in the east, and beneath lake linau. beneath lake linau, the direction of ﬂuid ﬂow is slightly rotated to wsw–ene (). also, types of ﬂuid change from one section to another, e.g., an acidic highly saline-type beneath lake linau and a neutral low saline-type south and east of lake linau (). the impermeable structure across faults prevent the ﬂuids from diluting each other ( 2016). however, faults are rather permeable along the vertical axis, which allows recharge of the system through the faults. rainwater infiltrates at a fault in the sw, at mt. lengkoan, and creek water infiltrates into the normal faults at lake linau (). the hydrothermal system discharges into lake linau and toward the ne, as driven by the hydraulic gradient ( 2014). the fracture network along the area is characterized by strike slip faults and normal faults. the sinistral faults strike n 40° and steeply dip toward the se. left step over on the strike slip faults forms an extension basin in the central study area. normal faults at the extension basin strike nw and dip 70°–80° beneath lake linau ( 2014). lithology lahendong area is mainly characterized by pre-, postand tondano formation of plioto pleistocene age ( 2010). the rocks are typically andesite, volcanic breccia, and tuff. those types have been sampled from borehole cores and used to determine porosity, permeability, and thermal conductivity. effective porosity and matrix permeability have been analyzed using a cylindrical-shaped specimen with a dimension of 5 cm x 5 cm 9 2.5 cm oriented parallel to the coring ( 2016). thermal conductivity has been measured on plain sections of dried cores. the experimental setup consists of a gas permeameter for determining matrix permeability ( 2011), of an helium pycnometry for effective porosity measurements (johnson- 1994) and of an optical scanner for thermal conductivity measurements ( 1999). these parameters have been measured and averaged for the three rock types ( 2016; ). andesite has an effective porosity of 3.7 %, a permeability of 2.1 9 10-14 m2, and a thermal conductivity of 1.8 w m-1 k-1 (dry) or 2.2 w m-1 k-1 (saturated). tuff has a porosity of 7.7 % but the lowest permeability of 2.0 9 10-15 m2 of 1.6 w m-1 k-1 (saturated). volcanic breccia is a permeable layer with an effective porosity of 10.5 %, a permeability of 2.3 9 10-14 m2, and a thermal conductivity of 1.6 w m-1 k-1 (dry) or 2.5 w m-1 k-1 (saturated). reservoir rocks reﬂect generally low matrix

2.0 9 10-15 element software feflow is used to model pressuredriven and thermally induced ﬂuid ﬂow including viscosity changes. governing equations for ﬂuid ﬂow and heat transport in saturated porous media are derived from conservation principles of linear momentum, mass, and energy (dhi-wasy 2009). details on the software and the parameterization can be found in diersch (2014). the model geometry is a 2d vertical sw–ne trending cross section extending 6 km in horizontal and 3 km in vertical direction. the direction of the profile has been selected to cover all relevant processes in the lahendong geothermal field: it cuts major faults and the production and injection wells, which are used for temperature and pressure calibration. furthermore, to the groundwater ﬂow direction, showing major ﬂuid ﬂow activities. the homogeneous and isotropic geological layers in the model are stratified nearly horizontally. faults in the middle of the model, striking perpendicular to the cross section, dip with 84° toward a cooling pluton beneath lake linau. details on structural and geological components of the modeled region have been presented in  (2014). is parallel it the numerical the mesh used for simulation in feflow consists of 45,264 nodes and 89,320 elements that are denser surrounding the faults because of expected gradients due to parameter contrasts. material properties of 123 elements are permeability, porosity, and thermal conductivity and set according to laboratory measurements (). however, properties of the faults and lake linau are slightly adapted to specific conditions. the definitions for the modeled grids along the faults are as follows: porosity is 30 % and thermal conductivity is 1.8 w m-1 k-1. corresponding grids for lake linau are defined by a porosity of 100 % and a thermal conductivity of 0.6 w m-1 k-1. the model simulates ﬂuid ﬂow and thermal transport in saturated media in steady state. initial values and boundary conditions fluid ﬂow boundary conditions in the model describe groundwater heads and recharge amounts (; ). the hydraulic head at the sw model boundary is 837 m and 500 m at the ne boundary. the sw hydraulic head represents infiltration of surface water into a fault, striking perpendicular to the model. hydraulic head at the ne border is adapted to borehole measurements in that area ( 2014). infiltration into the fault zones at lake linau is described by ﬂuid ﬂux boundary conditions. the quantity is 3.0 9 10-4 m s-1 the sw and 1.3 9 10-6 m s-1 at the ne fault distributed over 40 m fault width. groundwater recharge is set to 412 mm a-1 at the ne top surface (; ). fluid movement in for\\x0cthe model domain is constrained by no-ﬂow boundary at the bottom, recharge through the surrounding fault zones, and the low hydraulic heads in the ne model area. discharge of the system in the central study area is mainly toward lake linau and across the ne model boundary. initial hydraulic head for the whole model domain is 500 m. the heat is 116 °c km-1 at transport boundary conditions are time-invariant, fixed temperatures, and heat ﬂux (; ). thermal gradient the sw model boundary, and the temperature is constant 350 °c at the pluton. temperature of water infiltrating into faults and here mixing with shallow warm groundwater is 70 °c, while surface groundwater recharge is at 28 °c. temperature values are obtained from field and bore log measurements ( 2014). heat ﬂux is set to 100 mw m-2 at the bottom model boundary (; ). this value is fixed based on the studies from  (1998), nagao and uyeda (1995), and  (1998). initial temperature for the model domain is set as 116 °c km-1, according to the local thermal gradient. permeability determination initial values for permeability are defined based on laboratory measurements (). after each simulation run, modeled and measured temperature and pressure values have been compared at indicated observation points. in case of poor matching (errors [10 %), permeability has been adjusted until satisfactory results have been achieved. beneath lake linau, simulation results showed locally strong discrepancies between modeled and measured pressure and temperature (errors [45 %). adjustment of permeability in geological infiltration rates into faults, or hydraulic heads did not lead to acceptable results. only the implementation of strong permeability anisotropy throughout whole depth, i.e., an additional fault, resulted in minimization of errors (0–7 %). implementation has been accomplished by mesh adaptation to ensure appropriate behavior around the fault. by this procedure, permeability anisotropies have been located and characterized in detail throughout the model. layers, in general, defining a direction-dependent permeability improves the data fit rather than using similar permeabilities in all directions. this is probably due to the fractures increasing the permeability mostly in vertical direction. porosity and thermal conductivity remained constant throughout simulation. variation in porosity is negligible because it would directly be reﬂected in permeability, while thermal conductivity differences would only affect conductive heat transport, which is not dominant in the lahendong area ( 1998;  2014). 123 100c measurementa 500borelog ofmodel bottom boundary nemodel

best fit to the measured data changing the absolute and relative permeability in geological elements. relative permeability refers to different permeabilities in horizontal and vertical direction. as a main result, a blind fault has been recognized beneath lake linau, which has not been known from former studies. simulated pressure and temperature are measured at five selected observation points, which represent boreholes with available bore logs for pressure and temperature. details on data are given in . the model with best data fit, out of 370 different models, is considered to generate the final model developed for lahendong. permeability distribution and identification of a blind fault distribution of permeability patterns in the reservoir has been conceived comparing temperature and pressure data in several wells. especially beneath lake linau, closely located wells show high variations in temperature and pressure. a drop of 100 °c and 18 bar along 300 m distance has been observed between well lhd 24 and lhd 28. models first showed high discrepancies between modeled and measured values in this area. however, after implementing another high anisotropic permeable structure between the observation points, models resulted in satisfactory results. the structure has ten times higher vertical environ earth sci (2016) 75:1088 permeability than horizontal permeability. this structure is assumed to be another fault zone located between two known faults with vertical dip and nw strike. this fault shows no trace at surface, because it is covered by lake linau. generally, modeled permeability distribution in the lahendong reservoir is direction-dependent and overprints the lithology. modeled permeability is generally higher than measured ones in the order of up to four magnitudes. this is due to fracture patterns, which are not detectable at core-sample scale. permeability patterns directly affect subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow and temperature and pressure distribution. permeability in the faulted zones and surroundings is lowest in the study area. especially the middle and ne fault, the shallow area beneath sw lake linau and the deep ne section of the ne fault show low permeabilities between 10-13 and 10-14 m2 (). the area between the middle and ne fault, the deep section ne of the sw fault, the sw fault itself and the whole model area toward the sw and ne boundary show higher permeabilities of 10-10 and 10-12 m2 (). permeability varies not only within the modeled area, but also in vertical and horizontal direction. in faults and the deep reservoir section in the ne, permeability is by a factor of 10 higher in the vertical direction than in the horizontal direction (). in the areas between faults, permeability is in some parts by a factor of 10–100 lower in the vertical direction. in the rest of the model, vertical and horizontal permeability do not differ ().  final adapted permeability and anisotropy distribution throughout

some wells existing in this region are of artesian-type. overpressure releases through high permeable zones beneath lake linau and discharges toward surface. the pressure drop is up to 20 bars across the faults (). temperature distribution temperature distribution along the lahendong geothermal reservoir suggests that convective heat transport is the dominating process in the reservoir rocks. isotherms generally follow the sw–ne oriented ﬂow pattern, the rise and the infiltration of ﬂuids. upwelling of isotherms between the faults verifies water rise toward lake linau. infiltration of cold water causes down welling of isotherms particularly on the northeast section of the model. temperature is locally increased at the bottom of the model surrounding the pluton (). subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow the absolute and horizontal/vertical permeability distribution controls local ﬂuid ﬂow in the lahendong reservoir. the general ﬂuid ﬂow, driven by the natural pressure gradient, is oriented from sw to ne. vertical infiltration occurs at faults at lake linau and at the sw boundary. discharge is across the ne model boundary (). the more detailed ﬂow patterns can be observed with streamlines, which show a ﬂuid ﬂow along highly permeable areas. calculated streamlines describe particle ﬂow within the model domain. a forward calculation shows how infiltrating water at the sw model boundary distributes through the reservoir. the backward calculation shows the source of ﬂuid particles arriving at the ne model boundary (). patterns show that hot groundwater ﬂows toward the faults beneath lake linau, where the ﬂuid ﬂow is disturbed by a rise in temperature and vertically high permeable layers. this causes a rise of groundwater in this model area (red forward streamlines in ). at the same time, cold water infiltrates into high permeable areas and distributes over the ne model domain (blue backward streamlines in ). it is clearly seen that the composition of the ne reservoir domain is dominated by coldwater infiltration into faults, while the production areas are characterized by hot water ﬂow (). discussion investigation of subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow in geothermal reservoirs is crucial for sustainable exploitation avoiding drilling into less productive areas. subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow might be locally inﬂuenced by fault zones or physical 123\\x0c1088 page 8 of 11 environ earth sci (2016) 75:1088  model domain with calculated streamlines, in red: forward streamlines follow hydraulic gradient from sw model boundary towards ne, in blue: backward streamlines representing infiltrating cold water ﬂowing towards ne model boundary properties of water (i.e. viscosity). the inﬂuence of these parameters on the ﬂuid ﬂow has been investigated in lahendong geothermal reservoir using hydraulic–thermal simulations. simulation results show the detailed permeability distribution in the reservoir including location of an additional fault zone. matching of measured and simulated temperature and pressure has been used as a tool for resolving the permeability distribution. temperature and pressure have been iteratively determined at several observation points (). generally, modeled values are in good agreement with observed ones (). nevertheless, some observation points give slightly different values for both pressure and temperature (lhd 4 and lhd 7) or only temperature (lhd 24). this is probably due to the complicated ﬂow processes or strong small-scale structural variation in fractured and faulted areas. furthermore, density variations, which could have not been included into simulation due to high temperatures, could cause variation of ﬂuid pressure. however, the average deviation of simulated pressure and temperature is 1 %. implemented model parameters are porosity, permeability, and heat conductivity. from those parameters, only permeability has been tested in a specific range during simulation. the inﬂuence of porosity and heat conductivity on ﬂuid ﬂow is negligible due to dominating convective heat ﬂow ( 1998). values implemented in the model are based on measured permeabilities, which represent matrix permeability of rocks. the measured matrix permeability, representing permeability in horizontal direction, is 1.5 9 10-14 m2 on 123 average, which remains within typical permeability range for fractured igneous rocks (schoen 2004). permeability for volcanic breccias ranges typically between 3 9 10-15 and 5 9 10-12 m2 and tuff permeabilities range between 7 9 10-17 and 7 9 10-12 m2 (klavetter and peters 1987). in the wairakei geothermal field, simulating the impermeable layers resulted in permeabilities of 10-18 and 10-14 m2, in horizontal and vertical axis, respectively (mercer and faust 1979). however, permeability in reservoir rocks might be locally increased due to fracture formation. it might also be decreased due to alteration and sealing in faults. in lahendong, modeled permeability can be up to four magnitudes higher than measured ones in faulted areas. this is caused by fractures, which are not detectable in core scale. moreover, in fault cores, it is by a factor of 10 higher in vertical direction than in horizontal direction. however, in areas between faults (fault gauge), permeability is in some parts by a factor of 10–100 lower in the vertical direction. adaptation of permeability ensures a fit to measured temperature and pressure data. permeability in fractured areas is the main factor inﬂuencing subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow and temperature distribution in the lahendong reservoir area. subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow is driven by local hydraulic heads, which show high variations at different sections of the study area. consequently, convective heat distribution leads to high temperature variation along the reservoir. these phenomena are observed in lahendong as well as comparable fields. in new mexico, water level drops of 30–100 m are observed across (haneberg 1995). high several

measured temperature and pressure at selected observation points. well specifications and measured data from  (2014) temperature drops and upwelling of isotherms indicate that fault zones control the ﬂuid ﬂow in the lake long and valentine fields, usa (hooper 1991). the analysis of ﬂuid pressure differences at the alpine fault, new zealand, allowed to characterize the change in permeability between hanging and footwall blocks ( 2012). in summary, high pressure or temperature gradients are indicators for ﬂuid barriers between observation points. in other words, reservoir sections of different properties are separated by horizontally less permeable faults. in lahendong, most significant ﬂuid barriers are faults to the sw and to the ne of lake linau. across these barriers, the pressure drops up to 20 bars. a similar pattern has been measured in bore logs beneath lake linau, where no surface trace of a fault had been observed in former studies. however, only by implementing another fault, modeled and measured values could have been adapted. the recently identified fault zone beneath lake linau remains under lake water and therefore is only traceable by this kind of reservoir modeling. additionally to fault identification, the internal structure of known fault zones has been understood in detail. the ne fault, i.e., shows a displacement at 2 km depth. the detailed trend has been understood by permeability adaptation in this area. due to low permeability in horizontal direction in the faults, ﬂuids propagate mostly vertically toward the hot springs at surface. it also allows surface water to infiltrate into the reservoir in case the pressure within the fault zone is low enough (). this vertical ﬂuid movement eventually controls the temperature distribution in the reservoir. upward migration of deep hot water increases the temperature, while infiltration of cold surface water causes local drop of temperature. in summary, the most important factors inﬂuencing the reliability of numerical reservoir models are absolute and different horizontal and vertical permeability. however, a permeability adaptation has been done for each geological layer; the vertical permeability anomalies are overprinting those layers and are constraining the regional groundwater ﬂow. those permeabilities of fractures directly inﬂuence the productivity of the reservoir ( 2013). therefore, their permeability characteristics should be investigated in detail. in a previous study, a numerical model for the lahendong site has been set up in tough2 and aimed at forecasting the reservoir behavior during exploitation until the year 2036. with a production of 60 mwe, it predicts a pressure drop of 10 bars. however, the forecast results are uncertain due to lack of measured pressure draw down data (yani 2006). accordingly, the next steps of the presented study should include a realistic production and injection scenario in order reservoir exploitation. furthermore, chemical characteristics could be considered to achieve reliable production setups, because hydrochemical processes play an important role in the lahendong reservoir ( 2016). presented models from this study provide important information on ﬂuid ﬂow in the water-dominated lahendong reservoir. however, additional the two-phase ﬂow models of to support sustainable\\x0c1088 page 10 of 11 environ earth sci (2016) 75:1088 lahendong area are in progress to understand the inﬂuence of steam driven ﬂuid ﬂow in this high-temperature system. conclusion the primary focus of this study is to understand the inﬂuence of fault zones and permeability patterns on subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow in geothermal reservoirs. the ﬂuid ﬂow mainly depends on rock and fault zone permeability. these processes have been considered in numerical models, which simulate local temperature and pressure conditions. the initial reservoir conditions, which refers to the case before production starts. models are developed based on the conceptual models of the study area, which explain reservoir geometry, geological structures, temperature, and hydraulic conditions. temperature and pressure well-logs have been used for model calibration. the numerical models represent vertical and horizontal ﬂuid ﬂow is mainly controlled by fault permeability. this characteristic is used to simulate different reservoir sections, and vertical ﬂuid rise toward the surface. by stepwise adaptation of permeability fields, based on observed temperature and pressure gradients, an additional blind fault zone can be identified beneath lake linau. temperature and pressure significantly drop across that ﬂuid barrier. this behavior has been observed in comparable fields in the usa as well. the overall shape of ﬂuid ﬂow direction trends in a sw–ne direction. main recharge occurs by infiltration of surface water into the faults, especially in the southwest and near to lake linau. discharge is enhanced in highly fractured areas toward lake linau. vertical permeability of faults allows ﬂuids rising toward the hot springs at surface. results show that permeability has to be considered for simulation of a geothermal system. the geothermal system is mainly controlled by ﬂuid ﬂow in fractures/faults depending on temperature and pressure conditions. the locally modified ﬂuid ﬂow can considerably inﬂuence the productivity of a geothermal field. results also guide reservoir management in case of a potential for field extension, as performed in lahendong. acknowledgments the authors acknowledge the continuous support within
