       "'THE\\n\\nAMERICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE\\n[FIFTH SERIES.]\\n\\n———_#oe\\n\\nArt, VI.—The Thermal Conductivity and Compressi-\\nbility of several Rocks under High Pressures; by\\nP. W. Brineman.\\n\\nINTRODUCTION.\\n\\nThe effect of pressure on the thermal conductivity of\\nrocks has apparently never been determined, although a\\nknowledge of it is important in calculating the thermal\\nequilibrium of the earth’s crust. The only measure-\\nments we have that can give any idea of the possible\\ninfluence of hydrostatic pressure are on the effect of one-\\nsided compression on the thermal conductivity of granite\\nand marble.t It1is of course well known that a one-sided\\ncompression need not be at all like a hydrostatic pres-\\nsure in its effects, and the only conclusion that we can\\ndraw from the experiments of Lees as applied to condi-\\ntions within the crust of the earth is that the effect of\\npressure is probably not very large. .\\n\\nIn connection with my work on the effect of high pres-\\nsures on general physical properties of various sub-\\nstances, I have recently been engaged in measuring the\\nthermal conductivity of-a number of liquids up to 12000\\nke/em?. Since the apparatus could be adapted without\\nmuch trouble to measure the effect of pressure on the\\nthermal conductivity of those solids whose conductivity\\nis not too high, such as the rocks, I thought it of interest\\nto make a few measurements from which at least the\\ngeneral trend of the effects to be expected could be\\ninferred. I have been encouraged in this attempt by\\nthe interest and advice of Professor R. A. Daly, who also\\nwas so kind as to obtain several of the materials for me.\\nI also have to thank my assistant, Mr. H. B. Curry, for\\nmaking many of the readings.\\n\\n1For references see the end of this article.\\n\\nAm. Jour. Scr.— Firtx Sreriss, Vou. VII, No. 388.—Frpsrvuary, 1924.\\n6\\n 82 P., W. Bridgman—Thermal Conductivity and\\n\\nIn addition to the thermal conductivity I have deter-\\nmined the compressibility of the materials used. It was\\ncomparatively easy to do this as the apparatus had\\nalready been developed for another purpose. When I\\nbegan these measurements the important paper of Adams\\nand Williamson? on the compressibility of rocks had not\\nappeared, and such questions as that of the change with\\npressure of the compressibility of a rock had not received\\nan answer. Since the appearance of that paper, my\\ncompressibility results lose some of their novel interest,\\nbut there are still a number of points in connection with\\nthem which I think may suggest new lines of thought.\\nIn the first place, I have measured the compressibility\\nof several of my materials at two temperatures, neither\\nvery high it is true, 30° and 75°, but nevertheless suffi-\\nciently far apart to give an idea of the variation of\\ncompressibility with temperature. This of course is\\nimportant when applying results obtained in the labora-\\ntory at room temperatures to actual conditions. The\\nnecessary information can not be obtained from the\\nresults of Adams and Williamson because their compres-\\nsibilities were measured at only one temperature. In\\nthe second place, my method, which measures the linear\\nas opposed to the cubical compressibility, brings out the\\nimportance of non-isotropy, as the measurements of\\nAdams and Williamson on cubical compressibility can-\\nnot do. I have found surprisingly large differences of\\ncompressibility in different directions, and also entirelv\\nunexpected and abnormal hysteresis relations. Both\\nthese factors are of importance in calculating the velocity\\nof propagation of earthquake waves or other deforma-\\ntional effects in the earth’s crust.\\n\\nThermal Conductivity.\\n\\nThe Method.—The method used for measuring thermal\\nconductivity is essentially the same as that used for\\nliquids, and is deseribed in detail elsewhere;? a brief\\nsummary here will suffice. The material whose conduc-\\ntivity is to be measured is worked to the form of a cylin-\\ndrical shell, which is slipped between an outer and an\\ninner cylinder of copper, each of which it fits accurately.\\nAn insulated wire stretched along the axis of the inner\\ncopper evlinder carries an electric current, so that the\\n Compressibility of Rocks under Pressure. 91\\n\\nentertain the possibility of the conductivity being several\\nfold greater than the accepted value.\\n\\nPyrex glass does not depart from the average crys-\\ntalline rock in the effect of pressure on conductivity,\\nalthough the absolute conductivity is lower, as is usually\\nthe case for a glass.\\n\\nCompressibility.\\n\\nThe normal behavior of compressibility is as follows.\\nWhen a homogeneous isotropic solid is subjected to\\nhydrostatic pressure it experiences a uniform change of\\ndimensions in all directions, so that the geometrical\\nshape of any part of the solid is unaltered; this change\\nof dimensions is a function of the pressure and tempera-\\nture only and does not depend in any way on the past\\npressure history of the specimen. In other words, there\\nare no hysteresis, elastic-after-effects, or allied phenom-\\nena, but the strain is a single valued function of the\\npressure. The percentage change of volume for a given\\nincrement of pressure in all cases hitherto examined\\nbecomes less at the higher pressures (that is, the com-\\npressibility decreases at high pressures), and in nearly\\nall cases, although not universally, the compressibility\\nis greater at higher temperatures.\\n\\nFor the materials of this paper, this simple type of\\nbehavior is not always followed, but there are significant\\ndepartures. To exhibit these, it will be best to describe\\nthe results in detail.\\n\\nPipestone.—The first sample of this which I measured\\nbehaved in a way which was in one respect the most sig-\\nnificant and striking of any of this series. The experi-\\nmetal results are plotted in fig. 3, which shows the\\nobserved fractional changes of length against the corre-\\nsponding pressures. In the first place the change of\\nleneth is not a single valued function of the pressure but\\nthere is a very marked loop, in shape like the well known\\nhysteresis loops of magnetism or the stress-strain loops\\nof a substance stressed beyond the elastic limit. The\\ngreatest width of this loop was 18.2% of the maximum\\nchange of length. This loop is not a temporary phenom-\\nenon obtained only on the first application of pressure,\\nsuch as I have sometimes found, and which may be\\nexplained by flaws or crevices which are squeezed tight\\n 92 P. W. Bridgman—Thermal Conductivity and\\n\\nby a high pressure, but it is a legitimate and permanent\\neffect, which may be repeated, as this specimen had been\\nsubjected to a previous pressure seasoning. The two-\\npoints in fig. 3 which appear to be off the curve, at 1000\\n\\nand 10000 kg., were obtained by a slightly different pro-\\ncedure than the others, the 1000 point after a release of\\n\\nFie. 3.\\n\\nerrprepryport :\\none BESET ALE oa\\nsee cen he ETT |\\neecuaetel tadpi AP.\\n\\nTH fas\\nseated\\n\\n, iam\\nt rh E\\n\\n{ ET\\nac ene\\nSphere\\n\\nTt\\nttt\\n\\nomen ie .

Experi-\\nence with other lag effects would lead one to expect these\\npoints to lie off the curve in exactly the way found, and\\nthe fact that they were so found is confirmation of the\\nlegitimateness of the effect.\\n Compressibility of Rocks wnder Pressure. 93\\n\\nApart from the existence of the loop, the second sur-\\nprising feature is the direction in which it is described.\\n‘‘Hysteresis’’? means a lagging behind, and this suggests\\nin general the physical reason for the effect. Normal\\nhysteresis would demand that when pressure is released,\\ncoming from a higher value, for example, the change of\\nvolume does not assume the value appropriate to that\\npressure, but lags behind, assuming a value to be found\\nat some higher pressure on the ascending branch of\\ncurve. The physical reason is usually sought in internal\\nfriction or in some inherent small-scale instability except\\nwhen in one of two extreme configurations, as is best\\nuUlustrated in Ewing’s theory of ferro-magnetism.\\n\\nThe phenomena found here are the exact reverse of\\nnormal. On the descending branch of the curve the\\nchange of volume is that to be found at a lower instead of\\nat a higher pressure on the ascending branch. In other\\nwords, instead of this being a lag phenomenon, it 1s a\\nphenomenon of advance, and the loop is a reverse loop.\\nI have sometimes found effects like this, but only in com-\\nplicated systems in which the explanation can be found\\nin the interaction of a number of unlike phenomena, and\\nnever in such a marked degree as here. It is probable,\\nJ think, that there must be a complicated state of internal\\nstrains to account for such a state of affairs. An arti-\\nficial mechanism may be imagined, which may have some\\nrelation to the actual mechanism, which will give effects\\nof this kind. Suppose the solid contains a number of\\nlenticular cavities provided with a valve mechanism such\\nthat liquid can get from the outside into the interior only\\nwhen the pressure outside is in excess of that inside by a\\ndefinite amount, and similarly liquid can pass from the\\ninside out only when the pressure inside rises a definite\\namount above that outside. When fluid pressure\\nis applied to such a cavity, the first effect is to\\nsqueeze it flat, but when pressure rises high enough,\\nliquid penetrates to the inside and the cavity swells,\\ntending to resume its natural lenticular shape. When\\nthe external pressure 1s now removed, the eavity first\\nswells because of the volume expansion of the liquid\\ninside, but when pressure outside has decreased to a\\ncertain value, liquid comes out from the interior and the\\ncavity shrinks. That is, such a mechanism has an abnor-\\n 94 P. W. Bridgman—Thermal Conductivity and\\n\\nmally large compressibility during the initial stage and\\nan abnormally small compressibility during the final\\nstage of a pressure increase, with the reversed behavior\\nduring decrease, which is exactly the behavior of the\\nrever sed loop found above.\\n\\nThe importance of this effect in speculation is evident,\\nfor it is a consequence of it that the initial elastic con-\\nstants for small stress differences of a substance like\\npipestone may vary by a factor of more than two-fold,\\ndepending on the past stress history of the material.\\nFurthermore, the mean elastic constant will vary greatly\\nwith the magnitude of the deforming stress or the defor-\\nmation, so that it may be quite differ ent for the strains\\nwhich we have in tidal deformation and those found in\\nmountain building, for example.\\n\\nThe effect is so important that it seemed worth while\\nto verify it on other samples. Accordingly another\\nspecimen was tried in another apparatus, in order to\\neliminate any possibility of instrumental error. This\\nsecond specimen was measured at 30° and 75°. The\\neffect was again found, but much less in amount, the\\nwidth of the reverse loop being at 30° only 3.1% of the\\nmaximum effect, and at 75° 2.3%. The sample used with\\nthe second apparatus was a short rod about 2.5 cm. long,\\nwhereas that used with the first was 15 ecm. long. To\\nfurther make certain freedom from instrumental error,\\na piece 2.5 em. long was now cut from the first sample\\nand measured in the second apparatus at 30°. This\\nendeavor to ensure freedom from instrumental error was\\nreally quite superfluous because the identical apparatus\\nhad been used in measuring the compressibility of\\nmetals,’ whose changes of dimensions are much smaller,\\nwith no hysteresis or similar effects of as much as 0.1%.\\nThe effect was again found; the loop was again reverse,\\nand the width was 11.4% of the maximum. The shape\\nof the loop was not as regular as that found before, but\\nwas as indicated in fig. 4.\\n\\nIt is evident that the pipestone is not at all a homo-\\ngeneous material but that different parts differ greatly\\nin hysteresis effects, and presumably in internal strain.\\nAlong with differences in hysteresis goes a difference in\\nthe absolute compressibility ; the compressibility was\\nconsiderably less for the piece that showed large reverse\\nhysteresis. The following results were found:\\n Compressibility of Rocks under Pressure. 95\\n\\nFor the long rod with 18% reverse hysteresis the aver-\\nage linear compressibility between 0 and 12000 kg/cm?\\nwas at the rate of 4.34 X 107 per kg. For the short piece cut\\nfrom one end of the long rod the average change of length\\nbetween 0 and 12000 was at the rate of 3.87 X 10%. The\\nreverse loop of the other specimen was so narrow that it\\n\\nFia. 4.\\n\\nFic. 4.—The compressibility cycle of another sample of pipestone, change\\nof length against pressure. Again the direction of the loop is abnormal.\\n\\nwas possible to draw an average line half way between\\nthe ascending and descending branches of the curve.\\nThe change of length as a function of, pressure on this\\naverage line is given by the formulas:\\n\\nAZ\\nT = 6.50 x 10~\" 9 — 6.81 x 10-”* p? at 30°,\\n\\nGQ\\n\\nAl :\\nT= 6.89 KX 107 p — 5.81 X 107\" p’ at 75°.\\n\\nThe average linear compressibility of the specimen with\\nhttle reverse hysteresis is thus 50% greater than that of\\nthe other. Itis not to be expected that the compressibil-\\nity of material of this kind is the same in every direction,\\nand therefore the volume compressibility cannot be com-\\nputed from the linear compressibility in a_ single\\ndirection.\\n\\nIt is to be emphasized that the abnormal behavior of\\n 96 P. W. Bridgman—Thermal Conductivity and\\n\\npipestone may be expected to represent a lower rather\\nthan an upper limit to the abnormalities of the materials\\nof the earth’s crust in situ. For this piece of pipestone,\\nmeasured in a laboratory, was a small piece whose\\nexternal surfaces were free from stress, and in which\\nany internal strains must have been fairly small, because\\ndue to the differential strains in a small mass. The\\nrocks in the crust, however, are subjected to shearing\\nstresses up to the limit of their strength, and the stresses\\nvary greatly from place to place, so that the internal\\nstrains, and therefore probably elastic abnormalities,\\nmust be high.\\n\\nSolenhofen Iimestone.—This material was in the form\\nof a rod 10 em. long and roughly 6 mm. in diameter, cut\\nwith the diamond saw from the same piece as the thermal\\nconductivity cylinder. Its compressibility was measured\\nat 30° and 75°. At both these temperatures the same\\nreverse hysteresis was found as for pipestone, but much\\nless in amount. At 30° the width of the loop was 6.4%\\nof the maximum effect, and at 75° 2.4%. The effect\\ndecreases with rising temperature, as it did also for pipe-\\nstone, but by a much larger factor. A decrease with\\nrising temperature is what would be expected if it is an\\nInternal strain effect.\\n\\nAt 30° the average volume compressibility between 0\\nand 12000 kg/cm? is 0.0,1838 per kg., and at 75° 0.0,1392,\\nassuming equal compressibility in all directions. If the\\nmean compressihjlity is taken from a curve drawn half-\\nway between the ascending and descending branches of\\nthe hysteresis loop, then it will be found that the mean\\ncompressibility decreases with rising pressure, as is nor-\\nmal. The departure from linearity, which is about the\\nsame at both temperatures, is such that at 6000 kg. the\\nactual change of volume is about 4% greater than would\\nbe calculated by using the average compressibility\\nbetween 0 and 12000.\\n. Adams, Williamson, and Johnston’ found for the mean\\ncompressibility of CaCO, between 2000 and 10000 kg.\\n13.6 X 107, and found no variation with pressure. Their\\naverage figure agrees surprisingly well with the mean\\nvalue found above for limestone. :\\n\\nBasalt.—The sample used was about 2.5 em. long, and\\nwas the core of the thermal conductivity cylinder. It\\n Compressibility of Rocks under Pressure. 97\\n\\nwas measured at 30° and 75°. Again reverse hysteresis\\nwas found, but this time the greatest width of the loop\\nwas only 1.5% of the maximum effect. Within the limits\\nof error (not over 0.07%) the compressibility was the\\nsame at the two temperatures. If the mean of the\\nascending and descending branches of the loop is taken,\\nand the compressibility is assumed equal in all directions,\\nthen the relation between pressure and change of volume\\nis given by the formula: |\\n\\n.~ = 15.60 X 107’ p — 13.4 K 107\" pp’.\\n\\nAdams and Williamson? found for two diabases of\\ndensities 3.002 and 2.975, 12.4 *107 and 14.1 x 107\\nrespectively for the average compressibility between\\n2000 and 10000, with no perceptible variation with pres-\\nsure. My basalt, which is diabasic in character, was not\\nas dense; the agreement is as good as to be expected.\\n\\nTalc—Measurements were made on four samples.\\nThe first sample was a rod 10 em. long, not from the\\nidentical piece as the thermal conductivity sample, but\\nfrom the same lot. It was without evident schistosity\\nor other structure. It was measured at 30° and 75°.\\nThe smoothed results at these two temperatures were\\nsensibly the same, although at 75° there were perfectly\\nconsistent small departures from the usual course con-\\nsisting of a somewhat accelerated volume change at low\\npressures followed by a retardation, such that the total\\nvolume change at 12000 was the same as at 30°. There\\nwas no reverse hysteresis in perceptible amount. The rela-\\ntion between volume change and pressure for this\\nsample, assuming equal compressibility in all directions,\\nis given by the formula:\\n\\nAV\\nV\\n\\n— 10.4 X 10 \"p— 6.38 X 107\" p’.\\n\\n0\\n\\nThis compressibility is so much less than I expected\\nfrom the general softness of the substance, that the\\nquestion arose whether it was really equally compressible\\nin all directions. Professor Palache informed me that a\\nstructure would be expected from the manner of. depost-\\n\\nAm. Jour. Scr.—Firts Sreriss, Vou. VII, No. 38.—FrEsruary, 1924.\\n 98 iP. W.

He was so kind\\nas to select for me a sample from the same lot‘as the other\\nsamples which did show schistosity, the material evi-\\ndently having been laid down on a series of planes.\\nFrom this block three short rods were cut in directions\\nmutually at right angles, and the compressibility of each\\nof these rods was measured at 30°.\\n\\nThe results obtained for these three samples were all\\nperfectly regular, and without hysteresis, direct or\\nreverse. The relation between change of length and\\npressure could in each case be represented by an expres-\\nsion of the second degree in the pressure. The following\\nvalues were found:\\n\\nSample # I\\n\\nA\\nae 8.76 X 107\" p — 16.6 & 107\" p?\\n\\nSample # IT\\n\\nA\\nT= 5.69 X 107\" p — 5.49 K 107\" p”\\n\\nSample # ITI\\n\\nA ;\\nAl _ 3.84 x L077 p — 4.93 X-107\"? p?,\\n\\n0\\n\\nSamples I and III were cut parallel to the plane of\\nschistosity, while II was perpendicular to it. The results\\nshow in the first place a variation with direction of 2.3\\nfold, which is greater than I had expected in material of\\nthis character. In the second place, there is no immedi-\\nate connection evident with the plane of schistosity, the\\nlinear compressibility of II being intermediate between\\nthe other two.\\n\\nThe average initial volume compressibility, obtained\\nby adding the three initial linear compressibilities, 1s\\n18.3 x 107. The sample first measured was evidently\\n Compressibility of Rocks under Pressure. 99\\n\\ncut by accident along a direction of very low compressi-\\nbility. © ,\\n\\nIt is evident enough that a distortional wave through\\nmaterial of this character will not be propagated as\\nthrough a homogeneous isotropic substance.\\n\\nThe great variation found in the linear compressibility\\nof pipestone and tale probably has an important bearing\\non a suggestion in the recent paper of L. H. Adams and\\nWilliamson.!® These authors measured the cubic com-\\npressibility of rocks between 2000 and 12000 kg. by a\\ndirect method, but did not carry their results below\\n2000. EF. D. Adams and E. G. Coker,\" on the other hand,\\nhad measured the compressibility at low stresses by an\\nindirect method which involved the assumption of the\\nhomogeneity and isotropy of the material. They found\\ncompressibilities which in some cases were twice as high\\nas those found by L. H. Adams and Williamson. Adams\\nand Williamson reconcile the two sets of results by sup-\\nposing below 2000 kg. a very rapid increase of compressi-\\nbility, which is perhaps connected in some way with a\\nlooseness of structure of the rocks which disappears at\\nhigh pressures. Of course it is possible that this may\\nbe the correct explanation, and in any event the ultimate\\nanswer can only be obtained by a direct measurement of\\nthe comvressibility at low pressures, but in view of my\\nresults above it seems to me that a much more likely\\nexplanation is that the values of F.

Adams and Coker\\nare in error because of failure of the necessary isotropy.\\nDifferences of elastic properties with direction of the\\nmagnitude which I have found above would be more than\\nsufficient to explain the divergent results. ,\\n\\nPyrex Glass.—This material was in the form of a rod\\nabout 15 cm. long and 6 mm. in diameter. It was from\\nthe same length of tubing as the thermal conductivity\\nsample, and was made from it by working in the fire into\\na solid rod and drawing down. It was not perfectly\\nhomogeneous, but there were a few minute bubbles in it.\\n\\nThe compressibility was measured at 30° and 75°.\\nThe results were very regular and self-consistent. The\\nmaximum. departure of any point from a smooth curve\\nwas 0.36% of the maximum effect. There was no\\nhysteresis of any kind. Within the limits of error there\\nwas no difference between the compressibility at the two\\ntemperatures. Assuming equal compressibility in all\\n 100) PP. W. Bridgman—Thermal Conductivity and\\n\\ndirections, the relation between pressure and change of\\nvolume is given by the formula:\\n\\nAV\\nv\\n\\n0\\n\\n= 80.27 & LO p+ 9.9 x 107? p?,\\n\\nThis glass shows the abnormal feature, the first time\\nthat I have found it, of a compressibility which increases\\nat high pressures. The effect is comparatively large,\\nand much beyond the possibility of any experimental\\nerror, As I have already said elsewhere in discussing\\nthe possibility of such an effect,!? there seems to be no\\nfundamental reason why the effect should not -exist, but\\nit certainly is not what we expect. One might be inclined\\nto search for a connection between the effect and the\\nminute bubbles in the glass, but the effect of bubbles\\nwould be expected to be in the opposite direction, giving\\ntoo high a compressibility at low pressures before the\\nbubbles close up, and furthermore if the bubbles are\\nnumerous enough to have a perceptible effect on com-\\npressibility, one would look for hysteresis arising from\\nnon-hydrostatie internal strains in the neighborhood of\\nthe bubbles.*\\n\\nEvidence confirming the reality of this effect may be\\ndrawn from the work of Adams, Williamson,’? and\\nJohnston on compressibility. They found for all their\\nmaterials whose compressibility was as high as this a\\ndecrease of compressibility with rising pressure with the\\nexception of silica glass, which was constant between\\n2000 and 8000 kg.,in spite of the comparatively high\\nvalue of its compressibility, 3.1 x 10*. Now the experi-\\nments of Adams, Williamson and Johnston are not as\\nsensitive as these to changes of compressibility with\\npressure, and it may well be that if they did not find the\\neffect it is really negative. At any rate it is abnormally\\nsmall.\\n\\nThe compressibility of the pyrex found above,\\n3.03 & 10°, is unusually high for a glass which for ordi-\\nnary compositions is in the neighborhood of 2.3. The\\n\\n* Note added on reading proof. The abnormal change of compressibility\\nwith pressure has now been verified on a sample of pyrex glass free from\\nflaws and thoroughly annealed, prepared for me by the Corning Glass Works\\nfor this express purpose.\\n Compressibility of Rocks under Pressure. 83\\n\\naxis is a source of heat. This heat flows out radially\\nthrough the inner copper cylinder, through the shell of\\nrock, through the outer copper cylinder, and into the\\nsurrounding temperature bath through the walls of the\\npressure eylinder into which the outer copper cylinder\\nclosely fits. The difference of temperature between the\\ninner and outer copper cylinders is measured with\\nthermo-couples. From a- knowledge of the heat input,\\nthe temperature difference and the geometrical config-\\nuration, the thermal conductivity may be computed.\\n\\nThe interior of the pressure cylinder, in which the\\nthermal conductivity apparatus is contained, is entirely\\nfilled with an electrically insulating liquid (petroleum\\nether for 30° and kerosene for 75°) in which the conduc-\\ntivity cylinders are completely bathed. Pressure may be\\napplied to this liquid by means of the intensifier which I\\nhave often described.t| The pressure is transmitted by\\nthe liquid equally to all parts of the conductivity appa-\\nratus. The thermal conductivity may now be determined\\nas a function of the pressure in the liquid.\\n\\nThe most important correction to be applied to the\\nreadings directly obtained is that due to the lack\\nof perfect fit between the cylinder of rock and the inner.\\nand outer copper cylinders. It was of course not possi-\\nble to make the fit perfect, so that in addition to the rock\\nin which we are interested there was always a film of\\nliquid between the two copper cylinders. What was\\nactually measured was the resultant conductivity of\\nlayers of rock and liquid in series. Since the thermal\\nconductivity of the liquid is much less than that of the\\nrock, it is necessary to know the geometrical dimensions\\naccurately. The cylinders were formed by machining\\nor grinding, and were of a gratifying geometrical reg-\\nularity. The outside diameter was uniform within a few\\nten-thousandths of an inch, as was also the length. The\\noutside measurements could be made with sufficient\\naccuracy with ordinary micrometers, and mean dimen-\\nsions obtained from a large number of readings. The\\ninside diameter could not be measured directly. This\\nwas obtained from the total weight of the specimen, its\\ndensity (which was determined by weighing in water in\\nthe regular way), and the outside dimensions. The cop-\\nper cylinders could be measured directly with sufficient\\n Compressibility of Rocks under Pressure. 101\\n\\nvalue for pyrex is close to the value of Adams, William-\\nson, and Johnston for silica glass, suggesting a similarity\\nof effect.\\n\\nThis increase of compressibility at high pressures\\ndeserves to be more extensively investigated with other\\nmaterials.\\n\\nSummary.\\n\\nThermal Conductivity—The thermal conductivity of\\npipestone, tale, Solenhofen limestone, basalt, pyrex glass\\nand rock salt has been measured up to 12000 kg/cm? at\\n30° and in most cases at 75° also. The conductivity\\nincreases with rising pressure by an amount which may\\nvary from 0.1% per 1000 kg. at 30° for Solenhofen lime-\\nstone to 3.6% for rock salt. Probably for the ordinary\\nrock of the earth’s crust the effect is not over 0.5% at\\nordinary temperatures. The absolute conductivity and\\nits pressure coefficient may either increase or decrease\\nwith rising temperature.\\n\\nCompressibility—A simple hydrostatic pressure\\napplied to substances of the character of those measured\\nhere does not in general produce a uniform change of\\nvolume, but the effects are complicated. The relation\\nbetween pressure and deformation may be affected by\\nhvsteresis in a direction the reverse of normal; I have\\nfound this in pipestone, Solenhofen- limestone, and\\nbasalt in amounts varying from a few per cent to 18 per\\ncent of the whole deformation. Tale and pipestone show\\nlarge differences of linear compressibility in different\\ndirections; this effect was not investigated for the other\\nmaterials. Pyrex glass has an abnormal increase of\\ncompressibility at high pressures.\\n\\nGeological Consequences.—As far as the results on\\nthermal conductivity go, only rough conclusions can be\\ndrawn, but it would seem that in view of the possible\\nvariations found with pressure and temperature one\\nshould be prepared in geological speculations to con-\\nsider that thermal conductivity at a depth of several\\nhundred miles may be several fold greater than the value\\nnow accepted.\\n\\nThat the compressibility is different in different direc-\\ntions suggests that deep in the earth’s crust where there\\nare large differential stresses, with the probability of\\n 102.

From the dimensions of the solid parts, the\\ndimensions of the liquid layer could be determined. The\\ndimensions of the rock cylinders were approximately\\n0.5000 inches (1.27 em.) outside diameter and 0.4000\\n(1.02 em.) inside diameter and 1 inch (2.5 em.) long.\\n\\nFig. 1.—Cross section of the thermal conductivity measuring apparatus.\\n\\' Horizontal shading represents copper, diagonal shading the rock under\\nmeasurement, and the unshaded part the pressure transmitting liquid.\\n\\nIn fig. 1 is shown a cross section of the thermal con-\\nductivity apparatus, in which the cylinder of rock is\\nshown shaded diagonally between the outer and inner\\neylinders of copper (horizontally shaded) separated\\nfrom them by the unshaded layers of liquid.

There is, however, a geometrical\\ncorrection due to the change with pressure of the length\\nof the axis of the cylinder, but this correction is so small\\nthat it was neglected in the present work.\\n\\nThe formula gives at once the means of calculating the\\nconductivity of the rock if that of the surrounding liquid\\nis known. This was determined as a function of pressure\\nby the experiments on liquids, and the numerical values\\nmay be found in the paper describing those experiments.\\nThe correction for the liquid was of the order of one-\\nthird or one-quarter of the total effect at atmospheric\\npressure. Under the maximum pressure the conductiv-\\nity of the liquid increases by a factor of 2.7, so that the\\ncorrection is correspondingly reduced at the high pres-\\nsures. ‘T\\'he results are, therefore, better at the high than\\nat the low pressures.\\n\\nChoice of Materials ——The chief restriction on the\\nchoice of materials was the necessity of being able to\\nwork them into accurate cylindrical shells.

The other materials\\n\\n_@7i\\n6,—8.= | log\\n 86 =P. W. Bridgman—Thermal Conductivity and\\n\\nI chose after conference with Professor Daly, the object\\nbeing to obtain a few materials which could be worked\\nwith some degree of ease, and which at the same time.\\nin conjunction with the tale and pipestone already\\nselected, should fairly represent the range of material\\nto be encountered in the earth’s crust. It was at his sug-\\ngestion that Solenhofen limestone and a diabasic basalt\\nwere selected. Both of these were too hard to machine,\\nand had to be worked to shape by grinding. I am\\nindebted to Mr. David Mann for devising a method of\\ndoing this, and to my mechanic Mr. T. R. Richardson for\\nskillfully preparing the specimens. In addition to these,\\npyrex glass was also measured at the suggestion of Pro-\\nfessor Daly, who recognized the importance of an\\nexample of a glassy non-crystalline material. This was\\nnot prepared by grinding, but was cut into the proper\\nlength from a piece of commercial tubing of such size as\\nto fit closely the copper cylinders both inside and outside.\\nThis specimen was selected personally by Professor Daly\\nafter detailed examination of an extensive commercial\\nstock. HEven with this care, the glass was not as perfect\\ngeometrically as the ground specimens, but showed\\neccentricities of 1.5%. Mean dimensions of the glass\\nwere used in the ealenlations.\\n\\nIn addition to the rocks I have measured the thermal\\neonduetivity of rock salt under pressure, chiefly for its\\nphysical interest, as we are now becoming able to explain\\na good many of the physical properties of simple\\nerystals, and of rock salt in particular, in terms of the\\nfine structure, and the thermal conductivity of no simple\\nerystal has been measured under pressure.\\n\\nAnalysis of the Materials.—The pipestone was obtained\\nfrom the Ward Natural History Establishment at\\nRochester, N. Y., and is the material described by Dana\\nas ‘‘eatlinite.’’ It is an iron-rich clay stone; a typical\\nanalysis gives: SiO, 57.4, Al.O, 25.9, Fe.O, 8.7, H.O 7.4,\\nMgO and CaO trace. It is without ovitty inclusions of\\nany kind, and may be turned in the lathe without damage\\nto the keen edge of a steel tool. The material was not per-\\nfectly homogeneous in appearance, but the color varied\\nfrom a deep red to a much paler and yellowish hue. The\\nthermal conductivity sample was a deep red throughout.\\nIts density at 20° was 2.840 (corrected for vacunm, as\\nare all the densities given in the following).\\n land\\n\\nCompressibility of Rocks under Pressure. 8\\n\\nThe tale was from the Hewitt mine, Hewitt, N. C. and\\nwas very soft without any gritty inclusions. The analy-\\nsis is given as follows in Heconomic Paper No. 3, 1900, of\\nthe N. C. Geological Survey: Water 5.10; Silica (Si0,)\\n61.35; Al,O, 4.42; FeO 1.68; CaO 0.82; MgO 26.03;\\nNa,.O 0.62; and K,O trace.\\n\\nThe material is not perfectly homogeneous, but there\\nis a certain amount of schistosity evident, the material\\nhaving apparently been laid down im layers. The den-\\nsity at 20° 1s 2.701. ,\\n\\nThe Solenhofen limestone is very nearly pure CaCO...\\nIt is of a light brownish color, and was deposited in\\nlayers from one-half to three-quarters of an inch thick.\\nThe thermal conductivity and the compressibility samples\\nwere cut from the same layer. The density at 20° is\\n2.602.\\n\\nThe diabasic basalt is described as follows by Profes-\\nsor K. S. Larsen of the University Museum; I am much\\nindebted to him for procuring the analysis.\\n\\n‘“‘The sample is made up in large part of labradorite laths\\nand augite grains, the latter moulding about and between the\\nformer. There is about 10% of interstitial brown matrix that\\nwas originally mostly glass but is now partly devitrified and car-\\nries microlites of augite and is clouded with magnetite grains.\\nOlivine in grains now altered to a serpentine-like mineral makes\\nup nearly 10% of the rock. The feldspars are partly altered\\nto a mineral that resembles sericite.\\n\\nThe plagioclase laths average about 0.1 mm. in length, the\\nolivine grains about 0.1 mm. in diameter and the augite grains\\na little larger. The serpentine and sericite are hydrous minerals\\nand might lose some of their water even below 100° C.’’\\n\\nThe density at room temperature was 2.924.\\n\\nThe pyrex glass was approximately: S10, 81.35, B.O,\\n11.50, Na,O 4.00; Al,O, 2.1, CaO 0.2, MgO 0.28. The\\ndensity at room temperature was 2.234.\\n\\nThe rock salt was a natural crystal, perfectly clear and\\nflawless. It was machined to shape in the lathe with\\ncutting tools, and I owe it to the skill of Mr. David Mann.\\n\\nResults—The regularity of the readings was not as\\ngreat as that possible to obtain with the liquids. The\\nreason is that the apparatus is best adapted to materials\\nwith low conductivity, and the conductivity of liquids is\\nlower than that of those solids measured here. Never-\\ntheless a degree of accuracy was obtained amply sufficient\\nfor the purpose in hand, and doubtless the accuracy of\\n 88 P. W.

Therefore, the characterization of fault zones is\\nan important step toward performance assessment of a\\nreservoir. The ﬂuid ﬂow is controlled also by pressure and\\ntemperature conditions.\\nIn this context, we simulated\\npressure and temperature ﬁelds to elaborate on the inﬂu-\\nence of permeability on subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow in the\\nLahendong geothermal reservoir. Thermal–hydraulic sim-\\nulation is performed using a ﬁnite element approach.\\nAdjusting the permeability through 370 different cases,\\nmodeling results converged to the observed data within a\\nmisﬁt range of 0–7 %. The best ﬁtting models identiﬁed a\\ndeep-seated fault that has previously not been traced at the\\nsurface. Simulated temperature distribution suggests a\\nprominent convective heat ﬂow, driven by an upward\\nmigrating and SW–NE oriented ﬂuid ﬂow. This hydraulic\\ngradient causes a pressure drop along the reservoir. High-\\npressure patterns are used to constrain recharge areas, in\\naddition to inﬁltration measurements.

The\\nproductivity of a geothermal ﬁeld mainly depends on\\nsubsurface ﬂuid ﬂow, which in active tectonic regions is\\ncontrolled by permeability of fault zones (Moeck 2014). In\\nthat frame, the primary focus is on locating and charac-\\nterizing faulted areas in geothermal ﬁelds. This study\\nemploys numerical modeling to allocate and quantify\\npermeability anisotropies and discontinuities, e.g., faults, in\\norder to understand their inﬂuence on subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow\\nin geothermal reservoirs.\\n\\nNumerical models have been increasingly used to\\nunderstand the setup and productivity of geothermal sys-\\ntems. A general overview of geothermal models has been\\ngiven by O’Sullivan et al. (2001). Additionally, there are\\nseveral sites exemplifying similar characteristics as in\\nLahendong. The underground movement of hot and cold\\nﬂuids has been modeled for geothermal ﬁelds in New\\nZealand (Kaya et al. 2014). The Kakkonda geothermal site,\\ne.g., consists of two reservoirs at various depths with dif-\\nferent ﬂuid properties. There,\\nresults from ﬂuid ﬂow\\nanalysis show the importance of fractures for ﬂuid transport\\nenhancing the recharge or discharge in the reservoir\\n\\n123\\n\\n\\x0c1088 Page 2 of 11\\n\\nEnviron Earth Sci (2016) 75:1088\\n\\n(McGuinness et al. 1995). Generally, faults acting as\\npreferential ﬂuid path ways signiﬁcantly change the pres-\\nsure and temperature ﬁeld in the reservoir (Cherubini et al.\\n2013). Models for the Seferihisar–Balc¸ova ﬁeld focus on\\nthe ﬂuid ﬂow inside of faults. Results show an enhanced\\nupward heat transport through ﬂuids from bottom of the\\ngeothermal system (Magri et al. 2011).\\n\\nOur test ground is the Lahendong geothermal ﬁeld\\nlocated in Sulawesi, Indonesia. The ﬁeld is owned and\\noperated by P.T. Pertamina Geothermal Energy and hosts a\\npower plant with a production capacity of 80 MWe. There,\\ngeothermal exploration started in the early 1970s including\\ngeophysical and geohydrochemical approaches. It\\nis a\\nwater-dominated magmatic structurally controlled system.\\nFaults generally act as across-fault ﬂuid barriers and along-\\nfault ﬂuid conductors (Brehme et al. 2014). As a result, hot\\nsprings mainly appear on the top of vertically permeable\\nfaults at the surface. Available numerous drilling and sur-\\nface measurements allowed a detailed characterization of\\nthe geological and hydrogeological setting of the area\\n(Fig. 1; Brehme et al. 2011, 2013, 2014, 2016; Wiegand\\net al. 2013). The model presented here is developed for\\ninvestigating subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow and the permeability\\ndistribution including the fault zones in the Lahendong\\ngeothermal ﬁeld. Below, the geological structure of the\\n\\nﬁeld is presented followed by an introduction to the mod-\\neling approach.\\n\\nDetailed investigation of subsurface permeability dis-\\ntribution is a crucial step for site selection and smart dril-\\nling strategies. The numerical simulations presented will\\nprovide insight into understanding the subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow\\nconsidering the hydraulic conductivity of faults. It ensures\\nproductive as well as sustainable operation of geothermal\\nﬁelds avoiding risks, such as drilling into non-fractured or\\ncold zones, and targeting highly corroding waters.\\nAlthough the target area is Lahendong, the general work-\\nﬂow is applicable for other geothermal sites consisting of\\nsimilar constraints.\\n\\nReservoir characterization\\n\\nHydrogeology\\n\\nThe overall driving force for the ﬂuid ﬂow is the SW–NE\\noriented natural hydraulic gradient\\nin the Lahendong\\ngeothermal system. The direction of ﬂuid ﬂow varies\\nthrough the geothermal site due to horizontal partitioning\\nof the reservoir by relatively less permeable fault zones\\n(Brehme et al. 2014). The basic sections are located in the\\n\\nFig. 1 Topographic map of the study area with geological features, water and rock sample locations, and model cross section\\n\\n123\\n\\n\\x0cEnviron Earth Sci (2016) 75:1088\\n\\nPage 3 of 11\\n\\n1088\\n\\nsouth, in the east, and beneath Lake Linau. Beneath Lake\\nLinau, the direction of ﬂuid ﬂow is slightly rotated to\\nWSW–ENE (Fig. 1). Also, types of ﬂuid change from one\\nsection to another, e.g., an acidic highly saline-type\\nbeneath Lake Linau and a neutral low saline-type south and\\neast of Lake Linau (Fig. 1). The impermeable structure\\nacross faults prevent the ﬂuids from diluting each other\\n(Brehme et al. 2016). However, faults are rather permeable\\nalong the vertical axis, which allows recharge of the system\\nthrough the faults. Rainwater inﬁltrates at a fault in the SW,\\nat Mt. Lengkoan, and creek water inﬁltrates into the normal\\nfaults at Lake Linau (Fig. 2). The hydrothermal system\\ndischarges into Lake Linau and toward the NE, as driven\\nby the hydraulic gradient (Brehme et al. 2014).\\n\\nThe fracture network along the area is characterized by\\nstrike slip faults and normal faults. The sinistral faults\\nstrike N 40° and steeply dip toward the SE. Left step over\\non the strike slip faults forms an extension basin in the\\ncentral study area. Normal faults at the extension basin\\nstrike NW and dip 70°–80° beneath Lake Linau (Brehme\\net al. 2014).\\n\\nLithology\\n\\nLahendong area is mainly characterized by Pre-, Post- and\\nTondano formation of Plio- to Pleistocene age (Koestono\\net al. 2010). The rocks are typically andesite, volcanic\\nbreccia, and tuff. Those types have been sampled from\\nborehole cores and used to determine porosity, permeabil-\\nity, and thermal conductivity. Effective porosity and matrix\\npermeability have been analyzed using a cylindrical-shaped\\n\\nspecimen with a dimension of 5 cm x 5 cm 9 2.5 cm ori-\\nented parallel to the coring (Brehme et al. 2016). Thermal\\nconductivity has been measured on plain sections of dried\\ncores. The experimental setup consists of a gas perme-\\nameter for determining matrix permeability (Milsch et al.\\n2011), of an helium pycnometry for effective porosity\\nmeasurements (Johnson-Maynard et al. 1994) and of an\\noptical scanner for thermal conductivity measurements\\n(Popov et al. 1999). These parameters have been measured\\nand averaged for the three rock types (Brehme et al. 2016;\\nTable 1). Andesite has an effective porosity of 3.7 %, a\\npermeability of 2.1 9 10-14 m2, and a thermal conductiv-\\nity of 1.8 W m-1 K-1 (dry) or 2.2 W m-1 K-1 (saturated).\\nTuff has a porosity of 7.7 % but the lowest permeability of\\n2.0 9 10-15 m2\\nof\\n1.6 W m-1 K-1\\n(saturated).\\nVolcanic breccia is a permeable layer with an effective\\nporosity of 10.5 %, a permeability of 2.3 9 10-14 m2, and\\na thermal conductivity of 1.6 W m-1 K-1\\n(dry) or\\n2.5 W m-1 K-1 (saturated).

Details on the software and the\\nparameterization can be found in Diersch (2014).\\n\\nThe model geometry is a 2D vertical SW–NE trending\\ncross section extending 6 km in horizontal and 3 km in\\nvertical direction.

Material properties of\\n\\n123\\n\\nelements are permeability, porosity, and thermal conduc-\\ntivity and set according to laboratory measurements\\n(Table 1). However, properties of the faults and Lake\\nLinau are slightly adapted to speciﬁc conditions. The def-\\ninitions for the modeled grids along the faults are as fol-\\nlows: porosity is 30 % and thermal conductivity is\\n1.8 W m-1 K-1. Corresponding grids for Lake Linau are\\ndeﬁned by a porosity of 100 % and a thermal conductivity\\nof 0.6 W m-1 K-1. The model simulates ﬂuid ﬂow and\\nthermal transport in saturated media in steady state.\\n\\nInitial values and boundary conditions\\n\\nFluid ﬂow boundary conditions in the model describe\\ngroundwater heads and recharge amounts (Table 2; Fig. 2).\\nThe hydraulic head at the SW model boundary is 837 m\\nand 500 m at the NE boundary. The SW hydraulic head\\nrepresents inﬁltration of surface water into a fault, striking\\nperpendicular to the model. Hydraulic head at the NE\\nborder is adapted to borehole measurements in that area\\n(Brehme et al. 2014). Inﬁltration into the fault zones at\\nLake Linau is described by ﬂuid ﬂux boundary conditions.\\nThe quantity is 3.0 9 10-4 m s-1\\nthe SW and\\n1.3 9 10-6 m s-1 at the NE fault distributed over 40 m\\nfault width. Groundwater recharge is set to 412 mm a-1 at\\nthe NE top surface (Table 2; Fig. 2). Fluid movement in\\n\\nfor\\n\\n\\x0cthe model domain is constrained by no-ﬂow boundary at\\nthe bottom, recharge through the surrounding fault zones,\\nand the low hydraulic heads in the NE model area. Dis-\\ncharge of the system in the central study area is mainly\\ntoward Lake Linau and across the NE model boundary.\\nInitial hydraulic head for the whole model domain is\\n500 m.\\n\\nThe heat\\n\\nis 116 °C km-1 at\\n\\ntransport boundary conditions are time-in-\\nvariant, ﬁxed temperatures, and heat ﬂux (Table 2; Fig. 2).\\nThermal gradient\\nthe SW model\\nboundary, and the temperature is constant 350 °C at the\\npluton. Temperature of water inﬁltrating into faults and\\nhere mixing with shallow warm groundwater is 70 °C,\\nwhile surface groundwater recharge is at 28 °C. Temper-\\nature values are obtained from ﬁeld and bore log mea-\\nsurements (Brehme et al. 2014). Heat ﬂux is set\\nto\\n100 mW m-2 at\\nthe bottom model boundary (Table 2;\\nFig. 2). This value is ﬁxed based on the studies from\\nDelisle et al. (1998), Nagao and Uyeda (1995), and Neben\\net al. (1998). Initial temperature for the model domain is\\nset as 116 °C km-1, according to the local\\nthermal\\ngradient.\\n\\nPermeability determination\\n\\nInitial values for permeability are deﬁned based on labo-\\nratory measurements (Table 1). After each simulation run,\\nmodeled and measured temperature and pressure values\\nhave been compared at indicated observation points. In\\ncase of poor matching (errors [10 %), permeability has\\nbeen adjusted until satisfactory results have been achieved.\\nBeneath lake Linau, simulation results showed locally\\nstrong discrepancies between modeled and measured\\npressure and temperature (errors [45 %). Adjustment of\\npermeability in geological\\ninﬁltration rates into\\nfaults, or hydraulic heads did not lead to acceptable results.\\nOnly the implementation of strong permeability anisotropy\\nthroughout whole depth, i.e., an additional fault, resulted in\\nminimization of errors (0–7 %). Implementation has been\\naccomplished by mesh adaptation to ensure appropriate\\nbehavior around the fault. By this procedure, permeability\\nanisotropies have been located and characterized in detail\\nthroughout the model.\\n\\nlayers,\\n\\nIn general, deﬁning a direction-dependent permeability\\nimproves the data ﬁt rather than using similar permeabili-\\nties in all directions. This is probably due to the fractures\\nincreasing the permeability mostly in vertical direction.\\n\\nPorosity and thermal conductivity remained constant\\nthroughout simulation. Variation in porosity is negligible\\nbecause it would directly be reﬂected in permeability,\\nwhile thermal conductivity differences would only affect\\nconductive heat transport, which is not dominant in the\\nLahendong area (Ondrak et al. 1998; Brehme et al. 2014).\\n\\n123\\n\\n100c\\n\\nmeasurementa\\n\\n500borelog\\n\\nofmodel\\nBottom\\n\\nboundary\\nNEmodel\\n\\ncDelisleetal.(1998),NagaoandUyeda(1995),Nebenetal.(1998)\\nbDWD(2007),Ho¨ltingandColdewey(2005),Saghravanietal.(2013)\\naBrehmeetal.(2014)\\n\\nSeeTable1\\n\\nMaterialproperties\\n\\nHeatﬂux(mWm-2)\\n\\n28ﬁeldmeasurementa\\n\\n70estimationa\\n\\nmeasurementa\\n\\n350borelog\\n\\n1.3x10-8calculationb\\n\\nmeasurementa\\n1.3x10-4ﬁeld\\n\\nlogmeasurementa\\n116°Ckm-1bore\\n\\n70estimationa\\n\\nmeasurementa\\n3.0x10-4ﬁeld\\n\\nelevationa\\n767surface\\n\\nmeasurementa\\n\\n837borelog\\n\\nNEmodelsurface\\n\\nNEfault\\n\\nCoolingpluton\\n\\nLake\\n\\nSWfault\\n\\nSWmodelboundary\\n\\nTemperature(°C)\\n\\nHeattransport\\n\\nFluidﬂux(ms-1)\\n\\nHydraulichead(m)\\n\\nFluidﬂow\\n\\ncondition\\nTypeofBoundary\\n\\nTable2Boundaryconditionspeciﬁcationsandrespectivereferencesofdatabase\\n\\nEnviron Earth Sci (2016) 75:1088\\n\\nPage 5 of 11\\n\\n1088\\n\\n\\x0c1088 Page 6 of 11\\n\\nResults\\n\\nNumerical simulation is performed to obtain the best ﬁt to\\nthe measured data changing the absolute and relative\\npermeability in geological elements. Relative permeability\\nrefers to different permeabilities in horizontal and vertical\\ndirection. As a main result, a blind fault has been rec-\\nognized beneath Lake Linau, which has not been known\\nfrom former studies. Simulated pressure and temperature\\nare measured at ﬁve selected observation points, which\\nrepresent boreholes with available bore logs for pressure\\nand temperature. Details on data are given in Fig. 6. The\\nmodel with best data ﬁt, out of 370 different models, is\\nconsidered to generate the ﬁnal model developed for\\nLahendong.\\n\\nPermeability distribution and identiﬁcation\\nof a blind fault\\n\\nDistribution of permeability patterns in the reservoir has\\nbeen conceived comparing temperature and pressure data\\nin several wells. Especially beneath Lake Linau, closely\\nlocated wells show high variations in temperature and\\npressure. A drop of 100 °C and 18 bar along 300 m dis-\\ntance has been observed between well LHD 24 and\\nLHD 28. Models ﬁrst showed high discrepancies between\\nmodeled and measured values in this area. However, after\\nimplementing another high anisotropic permeable structure\\nbetween the observation points, models resulted in satis-\\nfactory results. The structure has ten times higher vertical\\n\\nEnviron Earth Sci (2016) 75:1088\\n\\npermeability than horizontal permeability. This structure is\\nassumed to be another fault zone located between two\\nknown faults with vertical dip and NW strike. This fault\\nshows no trace at surface, because it is covered by Lake\\nLinau.\\n\\nGenerally, modeled permeability distribution in the\\nLahendong reservoir is direction-dependent and overprints\\nthe lithology. Modeled permeability is generally higher\\nthan measured ones in the order of up to four magnitudes.\\nThis is due to fracture patterns, which are not detectable at\\ncore-sample scale. Permeability patterns directly affect\\nsubsurface ﬂuid ﬂow and temperature and pressure\\ndistribution.\\n\\nPermeability in the faulted zones and surroundings is\\nlowest in the study area. Especially the middle and NE\\nfault, the shallow area beneath SW Lake Linau and the\\ndeep NE section of the NE fault show low permeabilities\\nbetween 10-13 and 10-14 m2 (Fig. 3). The area between\\nthe middle and NE fault, the deep section NE of the SW\\nfault, the SW fault itself and the whole model area toward\\nthe SW and NE boundary show higher permeabilities of\\n10-10 and 10-12 m2 (Fig. 3).\\n\\nPermeability varies not only within the modeled area,\\nbut also in vertical and horizontal direction. In faults and\\nthe deep reservoir section in the NE, permeability is by a\\nfactor of 10 higher in the vertical direction than in the\\nhorizontal direction (Fig. 3). In the areas between faults,\\npermeability is in some parts by a factor of 10–100 lower in\\nthe vertical direction. In the rest of the model, vertical and\\nhorizontal permeability do not differ (Fig. 3).\\n\\nFig. 3 Final adapted permeability and anisotropy distribution throughout the model domain.

Isobars drop following the\\nnatural hydraulic gradient from SW to NE. The SW section\\nof the system shows higher pressures, which is caused by\\ninﬁltration from higher elevations in the SW. Some wells\\nexisting in this region are of artesian-type. Overpressure\\nreleases through high permeable zones beneath Lake Linau\\nand discharges toward surface. The pressure drop is up to\\n20 bars across the faults (Fig. 4).\\n\\nTemperature distribution\\n\\nTemperature distribution along the Lahendong geothermal\\nreservoir suggests that convective heat transport\\nis the\\ndominating process in the reservoir rocks. Isotherms gen-\\nerally follow the SW–NE oriented ﬂow pattern, the rise and\\nthe inﬁltration of ﬂuids. Upwelling of isotherms between\\nthe faults veriﬁes water rise toward Lake Linau. Inﬁltration\\nof cold water causes down welling of isotherms particu-\\nlarly on the northeast section of the model. Temperature is\\nlocally increased at the bottom of the model surrounding\\nthe pluton (Fig. 4).\\n\\nSubsurface ﬂuid ﬂow\\n\\nThe absolute and horizontal/vertical permeability distri-\\nbution controls local ﬂuid ﬂow in the Lahendong reservoir.\\n\\nThe general ﬂuid ﬂow, driven by the natural pressure\\ngradient, is oriented from SW to NE. Vertical inﬁltration\\noccurs at faults at Lake Linau and at the SW boundary.\\nDischarge is across the NE model boundary (Fig. 5). The\\nmore detailed ﬂow patterns can be observed with stream-\\nlines, which show a ﬂuid ﬂow along highly permeable\\nareas. Calculated streamlines describe particle ﬂow within\\nthe model domain. A forward calculation shows how\\ninﬁltrating water at the SW model boundary distributes\\nthrough the reservoir. The backward calculation shows the\\nsource of ﬂuid particles arriving at the NE model boundary\\n(Fig. 5). Patterns show that hot groundwater ﬂows toward\\nthe faults beneath Lake Linau, where the ﬂuid ﬂow is\\ndisturbed by a rise in temperature and vertically high per-\\nmeable layers. This causes a rise of groundwater in this\\nmodel area (red forward streamlines in Fig. 5). At the same\\ntime, cold water inﬁltrates into high permeable areas and\\ndistributes over the NE model domain (blue backward\\nstreamlines in Fig. 5). It is clearly seen that the composi-\\ntion of the NE reservoir domain is dominated by coldwater\\ninﬁltration into faults, while the production areas are\\ncharacterized by hot water ﬂow (Fig. 5).\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\nInvestigation of\\nsubsurface ﬂuid ﬂow in geothermal\\nreservoirs is crucial for sustainable exploitation avoiding\\ndrilling into less productive areas.

The inﬂuence of these\\nparameters on the ﬂuid ﬂow has been investigated in\\nLahendong geothermal reservoir using hydraulic–thermal\\nsimulations. Simulation results show the detailed perme-\\nability distribution in the reservoir including location of an\\nadditional fault zone.\\n\\nMatching of measured and simulated temperature and\\npressure has been used as a tool for resolving the perme-\\nability distribution. Temperature and pressure have been\\niteratively determined at\\nseveral observation points\\n(Fig. 2). Generally, modeled values are in good agreement\\nwith observed ones (Fig. 6). Nevertheless, some observa-\\ntion points give slightly different values for both pressure\\nand temperature (LHD 4 and LHD 7) or only temperature\\n(LHD 24). This is probably due to the complicated ﬂow\\nprocesses or strong small-scale structural variation in\\nfractured and faulted areas. Furthermore, density varia-\\ntions, which could have not been included into simulation\\ndue to high temperatures, could cause variation of ﬂuid\\npressure. However,\\nthe average deviation of simulated\\npressure and temperature is 1 %.\\n\\nImplemented model parameters are porosity, perme-\\nability, and heat conductivity. From those parameters, only\\npermeability has been tested in a speciﬁc range during\\nsimulation. The inﬂuence of porosity and heat conductivity\\non ﬂuid ﬂow is negligible due to dominating convective\\nheat ﬂow (Ondrak et al. 1998). Values implemented in the\\nmodel are based on measured permeabilities, which rep-\\nresent matrix permeability of rocks.\\n\\nThe measured matrix permeability, representing per-\\nmeability in horizontal direction, is 1.5 9 10-14 m2 on\\n\\n123\\n\\naverage, which remains within typical permeability range\\nfor fractured igneous rocks (Scho¨n 2004). Permeability for\\nvolcanic breccias ranges typically between 3 9 10-15 and\\n5 9 10-12 m2 and tuff permeabilities\\nrange between\\n7 9 10-17 and 7 9 10-12 m2 (Klavetter and Peters 1987).\\nIn the Wairakei geothermal ﬁeld, simulating the imper-\\nmeable layers resulted in permeabilities of 10-18 and\\n10-14 m2,\\nin horizontal and vertical axis, respectively\\n(Mercer and Faust 1979).\\n\\nHowever, permeability in reservoir rocks might be\\nlocally increased due to fracture formation. It might also be\\ndecreased due to alteration and sealing in faults.\\nIn\\nLahendong, modeled permeability can be up to four mag-\\nnitudes higher than measured ones in faulted areas. This is\\ncaused by fractures, which are not detectable in core scale.\\nMoreover, in fault cores, it is by a factor of 10 higher in\\nvertical direction than in horizontal direction. However, in\\nareas between faults (fault gauge), permeability is in some\\nparts by a factor of 10–100 lower in the vertical direction.\\nAdaptation of permeability ensures a ﬁt to measured tem-\\nperature and pressure data.\\n\\nPermeability in fractured areas is the main factor inﬂu-\\nencing subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow and temperature distribution in\\nthe Lahendong reservoir area. Subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow is\\ndriven by local hydraulic heads, which show high varia-\\ntions at different sections of the study area. Consequently,\\nconvective heat distribution leads to high temperature\\nvariation along the reservoir. These phenomena are\\nobserved in Lahendong as well as comparable ﬁelds.

Well speciﬁcations and measured data from Brehme\\net al. (2014)\\n\\ntemperature drops and upwelling of isotherms indicate that\\nfault zones control the ﬂuid ﬂow in the Lake Long and\\nValentine ﬁelds, USA (Hooper 1991). The analysis of ﬂuid\\npressure differences at\\nthe Alpine fault, New Zealand,\\nallowed to characterize the change in permeability between\\nhanging and footwall blocks (Sutherland et al. 2012).\\n\\nIn summary, high pressure or temperature gradients are\\nindicators for ﬂuid barriers between observation points. In\\nother words, reservoir sections of different properties are\\nseparated by horizontally less permeable faults. In Lahen-\\ndong, most signiﬁcant ﬂuid barriers are faults to the SW\\nand to the NE of Lake Linau. Across these barriers, the\\npressure drops up to 20 bars. A similar pattern has been\\nmeasured in bore logs beneath Lake Linau, where no sur-\\nface trace of a fault had been observed in former studies.\\nHowever, only by implementing another fault, modeled\\nand measured values could have been adapted. The\\nrecently identiﬁed fault zone beneath Lake Linau remains\\nunder lake water and therefore is only traceable by this\\nkind of reservoir modeling.\\n\\nAdditionally to fault identiﬁcation, the internal structure\\nof known fault zones has been understood in detail. The NE\\nfault,\\ni.e., shows a displacement at 2 km depth. The\\ndetailed trend has been understood by permeability adap-\\ntation in this area.\\n\\nDue to low permeability in horizontal direction in the\\nfaults, ﬂuids propagate mostly vertically toward the hot\\nsprings at surface. It also allows surface water to inﬁltrate\\ninto the reservoir in case the pressure within the fault zone\\nis low enough (Fig. 5). This vertical ﬂuid movement\\n\\neventually controls the temperature distribution in the\\nreservoir. Upward migration of deep hot water increases\\nthe temperature, while inﬁltration of cold surface water\\ncauses local drop of temperature.\\n\\nIn summary, the most important factors inﬂuencing the\\nreliability of numerical reservoir models are absolute and\\ndifferent horizontal and vertical permeability. However, a\\npermeability adaptation has been done for each geological\\nlayer; the vertical permeability anomalies are overprinting\\nthose layers and are constraining the regional groundwater\\nﬂow. Those permeabilities of fractures directly inﬂuence\\nthe productivity of the reservoir (Cherubini et al. 2013).\\nTherefore,\\ntheir permeability characteristics should be\\ninvestigated in detail.\\n\\nIn a previous study, a numerical model for the Lahen-\\ndong site has been set up in TOUGH2 and aimed at fore-\\ncasting the reservoir behavior during exploitation until the\\nyear 2036. With a production of 60 MWe, it predicts a\\npressure drop of 10 bars. However, the forecast results are\\nuncertain due to lack of measured pressure draw down data\\n(Yani 2006). Accordingly, the next steps of the presented\\nstudy should include a realistic production and injection\\nscenario in order\\nreservoir\\nexploitation. Furthermore, chemical characteristics could\\nbe considered to achieve reliable production setups,\\nbecause hydrochemical processes play an important role in\\nthe Lahendong reservoir (Brehme et al. 2016).

This characteristic is used to simu-\\nlate different reservoir sections, and vertical ﬂuid rise\\ntoward the surface. By stepwise adaptation of permeability\\nﬁelds, based on observed temperature and pressure gradi-\\nents, an additional blind fault zone can be identiﬁed\\nbeneath Lake Linau. Temperature and pressure signiﬁ-\\ncantly drop across that ﬂuid barrier. This behavior has been\\nobserved in comparable ﬁelds in the USA as well. The\\noverall shape of ﬂuid ﬂow direction trends in a SW–NE\\ndirection. Main recharge occurs by inﬁltration of surface\\nwater into the faults, especially in the southwest and near to\\nLake Linau.

conductivity of rocks is essential to safe evaluation and engineer-\\ning optimization of a hlw disposal system in the rock at depth. in the present study, experimental investigations\\non the thermal conductivity characteristics of 47 pairs of granitic rock specimens were conducted using the\\ntransient plane source (tps) method. the specimens were collected from borehole cores in the beishan area,\\nwhich is being considered as the most potential candidate area for china's hlw repository. to evaluate geological\\nnature of the rocks, mineralogical compositions of the rocks were identiﬁed, and porosity of the specimens was\\nmeasured. the thermal conductivities of the specimens under dry and water-saturated conditions were\\ndetermined, and the effect of water saturation on the thermal conductivity was investigated. in addition, the\\ninﬂuence of temperature and axial compression stress on the thermal conductivity of dry specimens was studied.\\nthe results revealed that the thermal conductivity of tested rocks was dependent on water saturation, tempera-\\nture and compression stress. based on the obtained data, some models considering porosity were established for\\ndescribing the thermal conductivity characteristics of the tested rocks. furthermore, when the rocks have a\\nsimilar porosity, the quartz content dominates the thermal conductivity, and there exists an obvious increase\\nof the thermal conductivity with increasing quartz content. the test results constitute the ﬁrst systematic\\nmeasurements on the beishan granitic rocks and can further be used for the development of thermal models\\nfor predicting thermal response near the underground excavations for hlw disposal.\\n\\n© 2016 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.\\n\\n1. introduction\\n\\ndeep geological disposal has been the internationally accepted\\napproach for the permanent disposal of high level radioactive waste\\n(hlw) generated from nuclear power plants and other nuclear facili-\\nties. an hlw repository can be constructed in a host rock at a depth of\\nseveral hundred meters below the ground surface. the design of hlw\\nrepositories often relies on a multi-barrier system, which typically con-\\nsists of the natural geological barrier and an engineered barrier system.\\nas the last defense to the biosphere, the natural geological barrier\\n(i.e., the host rock) plays a critical role in ensuring the long-term safety\\nof the hlw repositories. because crystalline rocks such as granite and\\ndiorite have low permeability, high solidity, and good excavation stabil-\\nity, they have been considered as potential hlw repository formations\\nin some countries (hudson et al., 2011; wang, 2014). site selection for\\nchina's hlw repository started in 1985 (wang, 2010). the efforts\\nhave been focused on potential hlw repository sites located within\\ngranite intrusions in mainland china. since 1999, the beijing research\\n\\n⁎ corresponding

geology (briug) has performed site characteriza-\\ntion studies in the beishan area, china. so far, the beishan area has\\nbeen considered as the most potential candidate area for china's\\nhlw repository.\\n\\namong all the engineering properties of crystalline rocks at a\\npotential hlw repository site, the thermal conductivity is one of\\nthe most important parameters in design consideration because it\\nhas a direct impact on the evaluation of the necessary repository vol-\\nume and the optimization of the repository layout (sundberg and\\nhellström, 2009). for instance, in the swedish kbs-3 concept for\\ngeological disposal of spent fuel, copper canisters with cast iron\\ninserts containing the spent fuel are surrounded by bentonite for iso-\\nlation and mechanical protection (brantberger et al., 2006). the heat\\ngenerated by the spent fuel will increase the temperature of all com-\\nponents of the repository. for the bentonite buffer outside the canis-\\nters, the peak temperature must not exceed 100 °c. this requirement\\nimplies that the canisters cannot be deposited arbitrarily close to\\neach other. on the other hand, unnecessarily large distances\\nbetween the canisters will mean inefﬁcient and costly use of the\\nrepository rock volume (hökmark et al., 2009). to fulﬁll the temper-\\nature requirement, the rocks with low thermal conductivities will\\n\\n\\x0cx.g. zhao et al. / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137\\n\\n125\\n\\nlead to a larger distance between canisters than for a case with\\nhigh thermal conductivities. this is because the rocks with low\\nthermal conductivities will give rise to higher temperatures in the\\nbentonite (sundberg et al., 2008). hence, to design and construct\\nrepositories successfully, it is essential to perform an accurate as-\\nsessment of the thermal conductivity characteristics of the host rock.\\nover the past few decades, various experimental approaches have\\nbeen employed to measure the thermal conductivity of rocks. the re-\\nsults indicate that the thermal conductivity of rocks is closely associated\\nwith mineral composition, porosity, texture, and density, etc. (birch and\\nclark, 1940; clauser and huenges, 1995; hartmann et al., 2005;\\nözkahraman et al., 2004; pasquale et al., 2015; ray et al., 2007;\\nsundberg et al., 2009). for crystalline rocks with relatively homoge-\\nneous texture and low porosity, the mineral composition dominates\\nthe thermal conductivity. in volcanic and sedimentary rocks, the high\\nvariability of porosity in these rocks is a major factor controlling the\\nthermal conductivity (clauser and huenges, 1995; özkahraman et al.,\\n2004). for example, increasing porosity, which acts as barrier to the\\nﬂow of heat, often results in both lower p-wave velocity and lower\\nthermal conductivity values (özkahraman et al., 2004). for a given\\nrock, water content and temperature have an inﬂuence on its thermal\\nconductivity. generally, the thermal conductivity of the rock increases\\nand decreases with increasing water content (cho and kwon, 2010;\\ncho et al., 2009) and temperature (abdulagatova et al., 2009; birch\\nand clark, 1940; heuze, 1983; miao et al., 2014; mottaghy et al., 2008;\\nvosteen and schellschmidt, 2003), respectively. moreover, the effect\\nof water saturation on the thermal conductivity of rocks shows a gener-\\nally increasing trend with increasing porosity (nagaraju and roy, 2014).\\ngiven that the thermal conductivity of surrounding rocks around\\nthe excavations will be changed by the excavation-induced stress,\\nsome researchers studied the inﬂuence of pressure on the thermal\\nconductivity of rocks (abdulagatova et al., 2010; abdulagatova et al.,\\n2009; demırcı et al., 2004; görgülü et al., 2008; sibbitt, 1976; walsh\\nand decker, 1966; zimmerman, 1989). one of the main ﬁndings\\nachieved from these investigations shows that the thermal conductivity\\n\\nvaries with the pressure exerted on the rock. with increasing applied\\npressure, the thermal conductivity starts to increase and subsequently\\nthe increase rate tends to be a constant value due to gradual closure\\nof cracks and pores within the rock (görgülü et al., 2008; walsh and\\ndecker, 1966).\\n\\nwhile the above-mentioned studies provide meaningful insight into\\nthe thermal conductivity of various rocks, the thermal conductivity\\ncharacteristics of low-porosity crystalline rocks subjected to different\\nexternal factors such as water saturation, temperature and compression\\nstress have not been fully understood. on the other hand, the informa-\\ntion on the thermal conductivity of rocks in a potential hlw repository\\nsite must be known with sufﬁcient conﬁdence to provide necessary\\ninput conditions for its long-term safety assessment, which is one of\\nthe motivations for this study. in this work, experimental investigations\\non the thermal conductivity of the beishan granitic rocks are conducted\\nusing the transient plane source (tps) method. in the following\\ndiscussion, rock sampling and basic physical properties of the rock\\nspecimens are introduced ﬁrst. testing facilities and procedures are\\nthen described. subsequently, the water saturation, temperature and\\ncompression stress dependent thermal conductivity characteristics of\\nthe tested rocks are evaluated comprehensively, and ﬁnally some\\ninsights are obtained.\\n\\n2. rock sampling and preparation\\n\\nthe beishan area is situated in gansu province of northwestern\\nchina (see fig. 1). after a long geological evolution and weathering\\nprocess, the topography of this area is characterized by a ﬂat gobi and\\nsmall gentle rolling hills with elevations ranging between 1400 and\\n2000 m above the sea level. the crust in this area possesses a blocky\\nstructure with many granite intrusions (see fig. 2). other surrounding\\nrocks include mainly metamorphic and sedimentary rocks, as well as\\nquaternary cover. rock sampling was carried out in the jijicao and\\nxinchang rock blocks, which are currently considered as two of the\\nkey investigation sub-areas during site selection and characterization.\\n\\nfig. 1. geographical location of the beishan area and a photo showing its typical topography.\\n\\n\\x0c126\\n\\nx.g. zhao et al. / tectonophysics 683 (2016)

approximately 63 mm were taken\\nfrom six sub-vertical boreholes (i.e., boreholes bs05, bs06, bs15, bs16,\\nbs18 and bs19) in these two sub-areas. the borehole locations are\\npresented in fig. 2.\\n\\nfield observations indicated that the collected granitic rocks\\nwere relatively isotropic in texture and mineralogical composition. to\\nevaluate the geological nature of the rocks, a series of thin sections\\nwere prepared and then exposed to cross-polarized light under an\\noptical microscope to identify the dominant minerals in the rocks. the\\npercentages of the dominant minerals were determined by point\\ncounting on thin sections. for each thin section approximately 500\\npoints covering phenocrysts and groundmass were counted. according\\nto the quartz-alkali feldspar-plagioclase (qap) diagram (streckeisen,\\n1976), the rocks can further be classiﬁed. it can be observed from\\nfig. 3 that the rocks contain mainly a moderate to low amount of quartz\\nand alkali feldspar, and a moderate to high amount of plagioclase. this\\nmeans that the collected rocks dominantly range from granodiorite to\\nmonzogranite. for grain size characteristics, the rocks are from ﬁne\\ngrained to, medium to coarse grained. an overview of the basic informa-\\ntion of the rocks is listed in table 1. based on the borehole no. and\\nsampling depth, these rocks have been divided into eight groups.\\n\\na total of 47 pairs of rock specimens, 50 mm in diameter, were\\nprepared from the drill cores with a length to diameter ratio of approx-\\nimately 0.5. in particular,

the ﬁelds of geology and geophysics, laboratory approaches to\\nmeasuring soil and rock thermal conductivity can mainly be divided\\ninto two groups: steady state and transient state. in this work, the\\ntransient plane source (tps) method (gustafsson, 1991; log and\\ngustafsson, 1995) was utilized to measure the thermal conductivity of\\nthe specimens. as one of the transient measurement methods, the tps\\ntechnique is based on the use of a transiently heated plane sensor\\n(i.e., hot disk sensor) and a hot disk thermal constants analyser (see\\nfig. 4a). the used hot disk tps2500s system can measure thermal\\nconductivity of materials ranging from 0.01 to 400 w/mk. the hot\\ndisk sensor consists of a continuous double spiral, which is etched out\\nof a thin nickel foil (fig. 4e). this spiral is sandwiched between two\\nsheets of electrical insulation materials made of kapton. the sensor\\nacts both as a heat source for increasing the temperature of the speci-\\nmens and as a dynamic temperature sensor for recording the tempera-\\nture increase. during the measurement, the temperature in the sensor\\nrises and heat starts to ﬂow to the specimens. the temperature rise in\\nthe sensor provides an indicator of the thermal properties of the speci-\\nmens. if the specimens have good thermal conducting properties, the\\nheat will be transported rapidly inside the specimens. on the contrary,\\nif the specimens have good thermal insulation properties, the sensor\\ntemperature will rise faster and the heat will not be transported\\nas much as in the test of the good thermal conducting specimens.\\ncompared with steady state measurement methods such as the divided\\nbar (beck and beck, 1958; birch, 1950; sass et al., 1971) and the guarded\\nhot plate (abdulagatova et al., 2009; alishaev et al., 2012), one of signif-\\nicant advantages of the tps technique is that the thermal conductivity of\\nmaterials can be measured more quickly, typically from several to tens\\nof seconds. hence, a long wait for thermal gradients to equilibrate is\\nnot required and the moisture migration in response to temperature\\ngradients was minimized (jackson and taylor, 1986). on the other\\nhand, unlike some transient methods such as thermal needle probes\\n(barry-macaulay et al., 2013; von herzen and maxwell, 1959), which\\nare commonly used for soils and soft rocks, the tps method can be\\n\\n\\x0cx.g. zhao et al. / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137\\n\\n127\\n\\ntable 1\\nbasic information and geological description of the tested rocks.\\n\\nrock

tps method behaves, the\\nthermal conductivity equation can be solved assuming that the hot\\ndisk sensor consists of a certain number of concentric ring heat\\nsources located in an inﬁnitely large sample (hot disk, 2007). a con-\\nstant electric power supplied to the sensor results in an increase in\\ntemperature which is directly related to the variation in the sensor\\nresistance (r(t)) by the equation:\\n\\n\\x10\\n\\n\\x11\\nr tð þ ¼ r0 1 þ αδt τð þ\\n\\nð1þ\\n\\nwhere r0 is the nickel electrical resistance in the beginning of the\\nrecording, α is the temperature coefﬁcient of resistance of the nickel\\nfoil, and δtðτþ is the mean value of temperature rise in the sensor due\\nto a constant current pulse given by:\\n\\n\\x10\\n\\nδt τð þ ¼ p0 π3=2ak\\n\\n\\x11−1d τð þ\\n\\nð2þ\\n\\nwhere p0 is the total output of power from the sensor, a is the sensor\\nradius, k is the thermal conductivity of the sample that is being\\ntested and d(τ) is a dimensionless time dependent function with:\\nτ ¼ t=θð\\nð3þ\\n\\nþ1=2; θ ¼ a2=d\\n\\nwhere t is the time measured from the start of the transient\\nrecording, θ is the characteristic time, which depends both on\\nparameters of the sensor and the sample, and d is the thermal\\ndiffusivity of the sample.\\n\\naccording to eq. (2), and δtðτþ and d(τ) plotted as a function of τ\\nprovides a linear relationship with a slope that is a function of p0, a,\\nand k. thermal conductivity k can be obtained by ﬁtting the experimen-\\ntal data to the straight line given by eq. (2); thermal diffusivity d is cal-\\nculated from eq. (3) taking into account the τ value determined in the\\nprevious ﬁt.\\n\\nas mentioned above, the solution of the thermal conductivity\\nequation is based on the assumption that the hot disk sensor is located\\nin an inﬁnite material in perfect contact with the sensor surface.\\nthis means that the heat ﬂow generated from each measurement\\nmust not reach the outside boundaries of the specimen (hot disk,\\n2007). meanwhile, a careful preparation of specimen ends is required\\nto minimize thermal contact resistance. an estimation of how far the\\nheat ﬂow has proceeded in the specimen during a recording is the\\nprobing depth δp, which is deﬁned as (hot disk, 2007):\\n\\nﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ\\np\\ndt\\n\\nδp ¼ 2\\n\\nð4þ\\n\\nto determine the thermal conductivity with good accuracy, the\\nshortest distance from any part of the sensor to the nearest outside\\nboundary of the sample should be larger than δp. in our experiments,\\nthe used hot disk sensor has a radius of 6.403 mm. the shortest distance\\nis about 19 mm, and the probing depth is approximately 10 mm. for this\\nprobing depth value, we can consider that we are conducting a bulk\\nmeasurement.\\n\\n3.3. test

approximately constant under vacuum within\\n72 h (see fig. 5), indicating that the specimens were saturated with\\nwater. subsequently, the hot disk sensor was horizontally placed be-\\ntween the two saturated specimen pieces with the double spiral\\ncentered and totally covered, and the two specimen pieces were ﬁrmly\\nclamped together to ensure that there was no air gap between the\\nsensor and the specimen end surfaces, as presented in fig. 4d. in order\\nto remain water saturation, the saturated specimens and the sensor\\nwere kept in a plastic bag during thermal conductivity measurement\\n(adl-zarrabi, 2004). after the test, the used water-saturated specimens\\nwere suffered from dehydration treatment in a thermostatic drying\\noven at 105 °c for a period of 24 h and subsequently cooled in a\\ndesiccator to measure the thermal conductivity under a dry condition.\\nmeanwhile, the mass of the dry specimens (mdry) was measured, and\\nthe porosity (n) of the specimens was calculated using the equations\\n\\nn ¼ 100v p\\n\\nv %\\n\\nv p ¼ msat − mdry\\n\\nρw\\n\\nð5þ\\n\\nð6þ\\n\\nwhere v is the bulk rock volume, vp is the pore volume, and ρw is the\\ndensity of

temperature\\n\\nto investigate the effect of temperature on the thermal conductivity\\nof the tested rocks, measurements were performed on dry specimens\\nfrom 40 °c to 150 °c based on the requirements of the used test\\nequipment. compared with measurements at room temperature, the\\nexperiments under high temperature are time consuming due to a\\nslow stepwise heating process by using a constant temperature oil\\nbath and a temperature control system, as shown in fig. 4c. the thermal\\nconductivity measurement can only be conducted until the two speci-\\nmen pieces in the chamber with a specimen holder within the oil bath\\nhave reached thermal equilibrium and kept a target temperature\\nvalue. during thermal equilibrium of the oil bath, the hot disk sensor\\nmonitors continuously the temperature variation of the specimens.\\nfor our tests, the thermal conductivity of the specimens was measured\\nwhen the recorded temperature variation of the specimens is less

maintained constant for a period of about 15 min to avoid resid-\\nual temperature drifts on the specimens. based on the in-situ stress\\nmeasurement results obtained from the beishan area (zhao et al.,\\n2013), the maximum axial compression stress applied to the\\nspecimens was set to be 45 mpa to approximately simulate the\\nexcavation-induced stress near the vertical hlw disposal element\\nboundary at a depth of 600 m. the axial stress applied to the speci-\\nmens was recorded automatically, and the used stress path through-\\nout the course of testing is presented in fig. 7. the experiments were\\nconducted at room temperature.\\n\\naccording to previous experimental results (zhao et al., 2015a; zhao\\net al., 2015b), the identiﬁed crack initiation stresses of cylindrical spec-\\nimens of beishan granitic rocks under uniaxial compression using the\\ncumulative ae hit (caeh) method range from 45.3 to 109.1 mpa,\\nwhich are larger than the maximum compression stress adopted in\\nthe present study. hence, the stress-induced rock damage might not\\noccur in the tested specimens during loading. it should be mentioned\\nthat in the process of loading, the friction may occur at the interfaces\\nbetween the specimen ends and the sensor. due to limitation of the\\ntps measurement technique, the utilized test method does not consider\\nthe potential inﬂuence of interface friction effect on the experimental\\nresults. to reduce or eliminate the friction effect, further efforts are\\nneeded to produce innovative design for the test equipment. although\\nnot

degree of the\\nspecimens quantitatively.\\n\\n3.3.3. tests on specimens under uniaxial compression\\n\\nthe uniaxial compression tests on dry specimens were conducted\\nusing a hydraulic servo-controlled compression machine. for each\\ntest, two specimen pieces with the hot disk sensor were contained\\nbetween steel platens machined to match their end surfaces, as shown\\nin fig. 4b. the interfaces between the specimens and the steel\\nplatens were daubed with a thin layer of lubricant to reduce the\\nend effect of the platens during loading. when the experimental\\nsetup was

deviation\\n(sd) and coefﬁcient of variation (cov) of the thermal conductivity are\\nall less than 0.06 w/mk and 4%, respectively, indicating that the results\\nbetween specimens in each rock group have a good consistency. for all\\nrock groups, the average thermal conductivity values in the dry state\\n(kdry) range between 2.412 and 2.812 w/mk. the values under water-\\nsaturated condition

data were added to this ﬁgure.\\nit is seen that the thermal conductivity of the specimens shows a\\ndecaying trend with increasing temperature, and the values at 150 °c\\nrange from 5.7% to 8.7% lower than those at room temperature. this\\nmeans that within the used temperature range, the inﬂuence of the\\nincreasing temperature on the decay of thermal conductivity for these\\nrocks is limited. on the other hand, a possible reason for the gradual\\ndecrease in thermal conductivity is the generation of thermally induced\\nmicrocracks in the rocks because of a mismatch between thermal\\nexpansion coefﬁcients of adjacent mineral grains in a homogeneous\\ntemperature ﬁeld (jansen et al., 1993), which has been demonstrat-\\ned from a microcracking perspective based on numerical simulations\\n(zhao, 2016). based on the experimental data, the relationship\\nbetween thermal conductivity and temperature can be described\\nusing the equation:\\nk ¼ kr − at2\\n\\nð8þ\\n\\nwhere kr is the thermal conductivity of the rock at room temperature\\n(25 °c), t is the temperature in celsius, and a is the ﬁt coefﬁcient (see\\ntable 3). the parameter a affects the decaying velocity of the thermal\\nconductivity with the temperature, i.e., the decaying velocity of the\\nthermal conductivity increases as a increases. as shown in table 3,\\na in eq.

(2013), the above-\\nmentioned mixing models were used to predict the thermal conductiv-\\nity values of the tested rocks in the water-saturated state. fig. 9 shows\\nthe comparison between measured and calculated thermal conductivi-\\nties for the four different models. it can be observed from fig. 9a, b, and d\\nthat the geometric mean, the arithmetic mean, and the effective-\\nmedium mean yield similar prediction results and consistently underes-\\ntimate the thermal conductivity of the eight rock groups, especially for\\nthe groups with relatively high porosity values (e.g., groups bs05 and\\nbs15). the hashin–shtrikman mean shows a reasonably good ﬁt for\\nall rock groups, as shown in fig. 9c. the analysis results are basically in\\nline with observations reported by fuchs et al.

(11) reveals that the coefﬁcient b plays a critical role in controlling\\nthe increasing gradient of the thermal conductivity in the initial loading\\nstage (i.e., crack closure stage). the coefﬁcient c dominantly affects the\\nincreasing velocity of the thermal conductivity in the subsequent elastic\\ndeformation stage. based on experimental investigations on the ther-\\nmal conductivity of some rocks subjected to uniaxial stresses using a\\nsteady-state apparatus developed by demırcı et al. (2004), görgülü\\net al. (2008) found that the parameters b and c depended on the mag-\\nnitude of elastic modulus of the rocks, and subsequently established an\\nelastic modulus dependent model to predict the thermal conductivity\\nvalues under pressure. unfortunately, in the present study, the elastic\\nmoduli of the tested rocks have not been available. therefore, the\\nmodel proposed by görgülü et al. (2008) cannot be used to ﬁt our test\\nresults. according to fig. 14, we found that the increasing gradients of\\nthe thermal conductivities in the initial loading stage were generally\\nlarge for the rocks with a high porosity such as rock groups bs05 and\\nbs15. hence, the coefﬁcient b is associated with the rock porosity n,\\ni.e., b increases as n increases, as presented in fig. 15a. an

predictions and underestimated the thermal con-\\nductivity of the rocks under the water-saturated condition. future work\\nis demanded to verify the validity of various mixing models using differ-\\nent rock types with a large porosity range.\\n\\nwith increasing temperature from 25 °c to 150 °c, the thermal con-\\nductivity of the rocks shows a decaying trend and the values at 150 °c\\nrange from 5.7% to 8.7% lower than those at room temperature, reveal-\\ning that the inﬂuence of temperature on the thermal conductivity of the\\ntested rocks is limited. in addition, the thermal conductivity of the rocks\\nincreases with increasing compression stress in a nonlinear behavior,\\nand the increase rate of the thermal conductivity increases with an in-\\ncrease of rock porosity. it is found that the effects of compression stress\\nand water saturation on the magnitude of thermal conductivity of the\\nrocks are basically comparable. based on the experimental data, the\\nempirical models considering the inﬂuence of rock porosity have been\\nestablished for predicting the temperature and compression stress\\ndependent thermal conductivity characteristics of the rocks, and the\\npredictions are found to be in good agreement with experimental re-\\nsults. this study thus emphasizes importance of porosity on thermal\\nconductivity measurements even for low porosity crystalline rocks.\\n\\nwhen the pores and cracks in the rocks tend to close during com-\\npression, quartz content may determine the thermal conductivity, and\\nthere exists an increase of the thermal conductivity with increasing\\nquartz content. this is because the closure of pores and cracks increases\\nthe contact opportunity of quartz grains, and hence improves the trans-\\nportation capability of heat ﬂow in the rocks. while the test results pro-\\nvide insights into the thermal conductivity characteristics of beishan\\ngranitic rocks, one should be aware of the limitation of this study.\\nbecause the thermal conductivity of granitic rocks is inﬂuenced by\\nmany factors. in order to better understand the thermal conductivity\\nof granitic rocks related to rock characteristics such as rock fabric,\\ngrain shape, grain contact and grain size, comprehensive petrographic\\ninvestigations are recommended in the future. in the meantime, studies\\nshould be carried out to understand how the interactions between min-\\neral components affect the thermal conductivity. work is also being\\nconducted to investigate the thermal conductivity of the rocks

and improving the performance of exist-\\ning systems to satisfy continuously growing demand. the\\nproductivity of a geothermal ﬁeld mainly depends on\\nsubsurface ﬂuid ﬂow, which in active tectonic regions is\\ncontrolled by permeability of fault zones (moeck 2014). in\\nthat frame, the primary focus is on locating and charac-\\nterizing faulted areas in geothermal ﬁelds. this study\\nemploys numerical modeling to allocate and quantify\\npermeability anisotropies and discontinuities, e.g., faults, in\\norder to understand their inﬂuence on subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow\\nin geothermal reservoirs.\\n\\nnumerical models have been increasingly used to\\nunderstand the setup and productivity of geothermal sys-\\ntems. a general overview of geothermal models has been\\ngiven by o’sullivan et al. (2001). additionally, there are\\nseveral sites exemplifying similar characteristics as in\\nlahendong. the underground movement of hot and cold\\nﬂuids has been modeled for geothermal ﬁelds in new\\nzealand (kaya et al. 2014). the kakkonda geothermal site,\\ne.g., consists of two reservoirs at various depths with dif-\\nferent ﬂuid properties. there,\\nresults from ﬂuid ﬂow\\nanalysis show

1995). generally, faults acting as\\npreferential ﬂuid path ways signiﬁcantly change the pres-\\nsure and temperature ﬁeld in the reservoir (cherubini et al.\\n2013). models for the seferihisar–balc¸ova ﬁeld focus on\\nthe ﬂuid ﬂow inside of faults. results show an enhanced\\nupward heat transport through ﬂuids from bottom of the\\ngeothermal system (magri et al. 2011).\\n\\nour test ground is the lahendong geothermal ﬁeld\\nlocated in sulawesi, indonesia. the ﬁeld is owned and\\noperated by p.t. pertamina geothermal energy and hosts a\\npower plant with a production capacity of 80 mwe. there,\\ngeothermal exploration started in the early 1970s including\\ngeophysical and geohydrochemical approaches. it\\nis a\\nwater-dominated magmatic structurally controlled system.\\nfaults generally act as across-fault ﬂuid barriers and along-\\nfault ﬂuid conductors (brehme et al. 2014). as a result, hot\\nsprings mainly appear on the top of vertically permeable\\nfaults at the surface. available numerous drilling and sur-\\nface measurements allowed a detailed characterization of\\nthe geological and hydrogeological setting of the area\\n(fig. 1; brehme et al. 2011, 2013, 2014, 2016; wiegand\\net al. 2013). the model presented here is developed for\\ninvestigating subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow and the permeability\\ndistribution including the fault zones in the lahendong\\ngeothermal ﬁeld. below, the geological structure of the\\n\\nﬁeld is presented followed by an introduction to the mod-\\neling approach.\\n\\ndetailed investigation of subsurface permeability dis-\\ntribution is a crucial step for site selection and smart dril-\\nling strategies. the numerical simulations presented will\\nprovide insight into understanding the subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow\\nconsidering the hydraulic conductivity of faults. it ensures\\nproductive as well as sustainable operation of geothermal\\nﬁelds avoiding risks, such as drilling into non-fractured or\\ncold zones, and targeting highly corroding waters.\\nalthough the target area is lahendong, the general work-\\nﬂow is applicable for other geothermal sites consisting of\\nsimilar constraints.\\n\\nreservoir characterization\\n\\nhydrogeology\\n\\nthe overall driving force for the ﬂuid ﬂow is the sw–ne\\noriented natural hydraulic gradient\\nin the lahendong\\ngeothermal system. the direction of ﬂuid ﬂow varies\\nthrough the geothermal site due to horizontal partitioning\\nof the reservoir by relatively less permeable fault zones\\n(brehme et al. 2014). the basic sections are located in the\\n\\nfig. 1 topographic map of the study area with geological features, water and rock sample locations, and model cross section\\n\\n123\\n\\n\\x0cenviron earth sci (2016)

change from one\\nsection to another, e.g., an acidic highly saline-type\\nbeneath lake linau and a neutral low saline-type south and\\neast of lake linau (fig. 1). the impermeable structure\\nacross faults prevent the ﬂuids from diluting each other\\n(brehme et al. 2016). however, faults are rather permeable\\nalong the vertical axis, which allows recharge of the system\\nthrough the faults. rainwater inﬁltrates at a fault in the sw,\\nat mt. lengkoan, and creek water inﬁltrates into the normal\\nfaults at lake linau (fig. 2). the hydrothermal system\\ndischarges into lake linau and toward the ne, as driven\\nby the hydraulic gradient (brehme et al. 2014).\\n\\nthe fracture network along the area is characterized by\\nstrike slip faults and normal faults. the sinistral faults\\nstrike n 40° and steeply dip toward the se. left step over\\non the strike slip faults forms an extension basin in the\\ncentral study area. normal faults at the extension basin\\nstrike nw and dip 70°–80° beneath lake linau (brehme\\net al. 2014).\\n\\nlithology\\n\\nlahendong area is mainly characterized by pre-, post- and\\ntondano formation of plio- to pleistocene age (koestono\\net al. 2010). the rocks are typically andesite, volcanic\\nbreccia, and tuff. those types have been sampled from\\nborehole cores and used to determine porosity, permeabil-\\nity, and thermal conductivity. effective porosity and matrix\\npermeability have been analyzed using a cylindrical-shaped\\n\\nspecimen with a dimension of 5 cm x 5 cm 9 2.5 cm ori-\\nented parallel to the coring (brehme et al. 2016). thermal\\nconductivity has been measured on plain sections of dried\\ncores. the experimental setup consists of a gas perme-\\nameter for determining matrix permeability (milsch et al.\\n2011), of an helium pycnometry for effective porosity\\nmeasurements (johnson-maynard et al. 1994) and of an\\noptical scanner for thermal conductivity measurements\\n(popov et al. 1999). these parameters have been measured\\nand averaged for the three rock types (brehme et al. 2016;\\ntable 1). andesite has an effective porosity of 3.7 %, a\\npermeability of 2.1 9 10-14 m2, and a

than horizontal permeability. this structure is\\nassumed to be another fault zone located between two\\nknown faults with vertical dip and nw strike. this fault\\nshows no trace at surface, because it is covered by lake\\nlinau.\\n\\ngenerally, modeled permeability distribution in the\\nlahendong reservoir is direction-dependent and overprints\\nthe lithology. modeled permeability is generally higher\\nthan measured ones in the order of up to four magnitudes.\\nthis is due to fracture patterns, which are not detectable at\\ncore-sample scale. permeability patterns directly affect\\nsubsurface ﬂuid ﬂow and temperature and pressure\\ndistribution.\\n\\npermeability in the faulted zones and surroundings is\\nlowest in the study area. especially the middle and ne\\nfault, the shallow area beneath sw lake linau and the\\ndeep ne section of the ne fault show low permeabilities\\nbetween 10-13 and 10-14 m2 (fig. 3). the area between\\nthe middle and ne fault, the deep

within\\nthe model domain. a forward calculation shows how\\ninﬁltrating water at the sw model boundary distributes\\nthrough the reservoir. the backward calculation shows the\\nsource of ﬂuid particles arriving at the ne model boundary\\n(fig. 5). patterns show that hot groundwater ﬂows toward\\nthe faults beneath lake linau, where the ﬂuid ﬂow is\\ndisturbed by a rise in temperature and vertically high per-\\nmeable layers. this causes a rise of groundwater in this\\nmodel area (red forward streamlines in fig. 5). at the same\\ntime, cold water inﬁltrates into high permeable areas and\\ndistributes over the ne model domain (blue backward\\nstreamlines in fig. 5). it is clearly seen that the composi-\\ntion of the ne reservoir domain is dominated by coldwater\\ninﬁltration into

determined at\\nseveral observation points\\n(fig. 2). generally, modeled values are in good agreement\\nwith observed ones (fig. 6). nevertheless, some observa-\\ntion points give slightly different values for both pressure\\nand temperature (lhd 4 and lhd 7) or only temperature\\n(lhd 24). this is probably due to the complicated ﬂow\\nprocesses or strong small-scale structural variation in\\nfractured and faulted areas. furthermore, density varia-\\ntions, which could have not been included into simulation\\ndue to high temperatures, could cause variation of ﬂuid\\npressure. however,\\nthe average deviation of simulated\\npressure and temperature is 1 %.\\n\\nimplemented model parameters are porosity, perme-\\nability, and heat conductivity. from those parameters, only\\npermeability has been tested in a speciﬁc range during\\nsimulation. the inﬂuence of porosity and heat conductivity\\non ﬂuid ﬂow is negligible due to dominating convective\\nheat ﬂow (ondrak

per-\\nmeability in horizontal direction, is 1.5 9 10-14 m2 on\\n\\n123\\n\\naverage, which remains within typical permeability range\\nfor fractured igneous rocks (scho¨n 2004). permeability

permeability in reservoir rocks might be\\nlocally increased due to fracture formation. it might also be\\ndecreased due to alteration and sealing in faults.\\nin\\nlahendong, modeled permeability can be up to four mag-\\nnitudes higher than measured ones in faulted areas. this is\\ncaused by fractures, which are not detectable in core scale.\\nmoreover, in fault cores, it is by a factor of 10 higher in\\nvertical direction than in horizontal direction. however, in\\nareas between faults (fault gauge), permeability is in some\\nparts by a factor of 10–100 lower in the vertical

temperature gradients are\\nindicators for ﬂuid barriers between observation points. in\\nother words, reservoir sections of different properties are\\nseparated by horizontally less permeable faults. in lahen-\\ndong, most signiﬁcant ﬂuid barriers are faults to the sw\\nand to the ne of lake linau. across these barriers, the\\npressure drops up to 20 bars. a similar pattern has been\\nmeasured in bore logs beneath lake linau, where no sur-\\nface trace of a fault had been observed in former studies.\\nhowever, only by implementing another fault, modeled\\nand measured values could have been adapted. the\\nrecently identiﬁed fault zone beneath lake linau remains\\nunder lake water and therefore is only traceable by this\\nkind of reservoir modeling.\\n\\nadditionally to fault identiﬁcation, the internal structure\\nof known fault zones has been understood in detail. the ne\\nfault,\\ni.e., shows a displacement at 2 km depth. the\\ndetailed trend has been understood by permeability adap-\\ntation in this area.\\n\\ndue to low permeability in horizontal direction in the\\nfaults, ﬂuids propagate mostly vertically toward the hot\\nsprings at surface. it also allows surface water to inﬁltrate\\ninto the reservoir in case the pressure within the fault zone\\nis low enough (fig. 5). this vertical ﬂuid movement\\n\\neventually controls the temperature distribution in the\\nreservoir. upward migration of deep hot water increases\\nthe temperature, while inﬁltration of cold surface water\\ncauses local drop of temperature.\\n\\nin summary, the most important factors inﬂuencing the\\nreliability of numerical reservoir models are absolute and\\ndifferent horizontal and vertical permeability. however, a\\npermeability adaptation has been done for each geological\\nlayer; the vertical permeability anomalies are overprinting\\nthose layers and are constraining the regional groundwater\\nﬂow. those permeabilities of fractures directly inﬂuence\\nthe

the\\noverall shape of ﬂuid ﬂow direction trends in a sw–ne\\ndirection. main recharge occurs by inﬁltration of surface\\nwater into the faults, especially in the southwest and near to\\nlake linau.

due   to  severe   envi-\\nronmental   impacts   created   by   conventional   fossil   usage   on  global   climatic   change.   however,   its  wide\\napplication   has   been   limited   due   to   the   lack   of   knowledge,   particularly   of   the   geothermal   conditions   of\\nreservoir   rocks   at   elevated   temperatures   and   pressures.   such   high   temperatures   and   pressures   possibly\\nalter   the  mechanical   properties   of  reservoir   rocks   due   to   the   associated   micro-structural   and   mineralogi-\\ncal  alterations   of   the   rock   mass,   which   are   an   important   attribute   for   wellbore   stability   and   stimulation   of\\ngeothermal   reservoirs   for   safe  and   effective   geothermal   energy   extraction.   this   study   therefore   investi-\\ngates   the   stress-strain   behaviour   under   in-situ   stress   and   temperature   conditions   by   conducting   a  series\\nof  high-pressure,   high-temperature   tri-axial   experiments   on  australian   strathbogie   granite   under   four\\ndifferent  conﬁning   pressures   (10,   30,   60,   90   mpa)   and   four   different   temperatures   (rt,   100,   200,   300 ◦c).\\nthe  effect   of  temperature   on   the   mechanical   behaviour   of   rock   specimens   was   studied   under   tri-axial   con-\\nditions   and   the   corresponding   fracture   propagation   behaviour   was   observed   using   an   advanced   acoustic\\nemission   (ae)   system.   the   corresponding   micro-structure   alteration   in   granite   was   observed   using   sem\\nanalysis.   according   to   the   ﬁndings,   increasing   temperature   leads   to  an   initial   increment   in   reservoir\\nrock   strength   and   shear   parameters   followed   by   reduction,   and   the   trend   is   aligned   with   the   crack  for-\\nmation   pattern   of   the  rock   mass.   this   was   further   conﬁrmed   by   the   sem   analysis,   according   to  which\\nthe   rock   micro-structure   is   subject   to  only   minor   changes   at   relatively   low   temperatures   and  higher\\ntemperatures   cause   micro-cracks   to   develop   along   the   rock   mass   grain   boundaries.   furthermore,   the\\nconventional   mohr-coulomb   criteria   failed   to   model   the  stress-strain   response   of   rock   under   geothermal\\nreservoir   conditions,   and   was   therefore   modiﬁed   for   the   corresponding   in-situ   conditions.\\n\\n©   2016   elsevier   ltd.   all   rights   reserved.\\n\\n1.  introduction\\n\\ngeothermal

temperatures)  and  deep  granite  reser-\\nvoirs  have  been  found  to  have  adequate  temperatures  to  serve  as  a\\ngeothermal  reservoirs  (fox  et  al.,  2013).  such  explorations  involve\\nﬁnding  vast  blocks  of  “hot  rocks”  with  fracture  systems.  such  rocks\\ncan  be  used  to  generate  electricity.  in  this  process,  water  is  ﬁrst\\ninjected  and  circulated  through  the  fractures  in  the  geothermal\\nreservoirs  and  eventually  pumped  back  to  the  surface  as  steam.\\nhowever,  the  exploration  of  geothermal  resources  has  become  a\\nchallenge  to  engineers  and  geologists,  due  to  the  high  temperature\\nand  stress  environments  in  geothermal  reservoirs.  for  this  reason,\\nlaboratory  experiments  conducted  under  high  pressure  and  tem-\\nperature  conditions  (geothermal  conditions)  can  assist  in  providing\\n\\n\\x0cw.g.p.  kumari  et  al.  /  geothermics  65  (2017)  44–59 \\n\\n45\\n\\nbasic  predictions.  a  large  number  of  laboratory  experiments  has\\ntherefore  been  conducted  since  1970  to  investigate  the  inﬂuence\\nof  high  pressure  and  temperature  on  rock  in  relation  to  geothermal\\nheat  extraction  (siratovich  et  al.,  2016),  deep  geological  disposal  of\\nnuclear  waste  (paquet  and  franc¸  ois,  1980),  deep  mining  (wawersik\\nand  hannum,  1980)  and  geological  co2 storage  (dai  et  al.,  2014).\\nthe  mechanical  behaviour  of  reservoir  rocks  is  signiﬁcantly\\ninﬂuenced  by  elevated  temperatures,  because  they  cause  the\\nmicro-structure  of  the  rock  mass  to  be  altered  through  ther-\\nmal   expansion,  the  development  of  new  micro-cracks,  extending\\nand/or  widening  the  existing  micro-  cracks  and  various  min-\\neralogical  alterations.  rock  strength-deformation  criteria  change\\nwith  temperature,  and  some  rock  mechanical  properties,  such  as\\ncompressive  strength,  tensile  strength,  elastic  modulus,  cohesive\\nstrength  and  friction  angle,  decrease  with  increasing  temperature\\n(heuze,  1983;  dwivedi  et  al.,  2008).  however,  such  alterations  are\\nalso  affected  by  the  conﬁnement  applying  on  the  rock  mass,  and\\nconﬁning  pressure  causes  the  suppression  of  thermal  cracks  and\\nthe  extension/widening  of  existing  micro-cracks.  this  results  in\\nfurther  alteration  of  the  rock  mass  mechanical  properties,  result-\\ning  in  changing  failure  modes  (mogi,  1966).  studies  have  identiﬁed\\nthe  transition  of  rock  failure  mode  from  brittle  to  ductile  with\\nincreasing  conﬁnement.  however,  this  transition  is  diverse  due  to\\nthe  different  mineralogical  compositions  and  grain  boundaries  in\\ndifferent  rocks  (klein  et  al.,  2001;  wong,  1982).\\n\\nalthough  many  studies  have  been  conducted  to  investigate  the\\ntemperature-dependent  mechanical  behaviour  of  reservoir  rocks,\\nmost  experiments  have  been  conducted  in  unconﬁned  environ-\\nments  (singh  et  al.,  2015;  shao  et  al.,  2014).  pre-heating  the\\nspecimens  to  the  corresponding  temperature  ranges  and  test-\\ning  at  room  temperatures  has  been  frequently  done  (bauer  and\\njohnson,  1979;  xu  et  al.,  2008),  but  the  method  is  not  reliable,\\nas  geothermal  reservoirs  experience  continuous  thermal  stresses.\\nsuch  limitations  have  occurred  mainly  due  to  the  limited  number  of\\nappropriate  test  facilities  available  to  simulate  the  stress  and  tem-\\nperature  conditions  of  actual  geothermal  reservoirs.  although  some\\nstudies  have  analytically  and  numerically  evaluated  the  mechanical\\nproperties  of  rocks  under  high  temperatures  and  pressures  (chester\\nand  higgs,  1992;  tian  et  al.,  2013;  vásárhelyi  et  al.,  2016),  to  date\\nnone  has  captured  the  stress-strain  behaviour  and  failure  criteria  of\\nrocks  over  a  wide  range  of  conﬁning  pressures  and  temperatures,\\nparticularly  for  australian  granite.  however,  the  thermo-elastic\\nresponse  and  appropriate  failure  criteria  are  essential  inputs  for\\nmany  engineering  applications  under  high  pressures  and  temper-\\natures,  including  geothermal  extraction  applications.  this  study\\ntherefore  intends  to  ﬁll  this  gap,  and  it  is  hoped  it  will  make  an\\nimportant  contribution  to  many  deep  underground  applications.\\n\\n2.  methodology\\n\\n2.1.  tested  material\\n\\ngranite  is  an  abundant  crystalline  rock  in  the  earth  with  medium\\nto  coarse  grains  which  was  formed  as  a  result  of  the  slow  cooling\\nof  magma.  granite  therefore  has  abundant  radioactive  elements\\n(k,  th,  and  u).  such  elements  bring  elevated  geothermal  gradients\\nto  deep  granite  reservoirs,  which  therefore  have  ideal  conditions\\nas  geothermal  reservoirs.  the  mineralogical  composition  of  gran-\\nite  mainly  consists  of  quartz,  feldspar,  plagioclase  and  biotite,  and\\nsmall  amounts  of  muscovite,  amphibole,  hornblende  and  opaque\\n(dwivedi

 mercury  intrusion  testing  (porosity)  and  volume  and\\nweight  measurement  (bulk  density).\\n\\n2.2.  sample  preparation\\n\\nsample  preparation  and  testing  were  carried  out  at  the  deep\\nearth  energy  research  laboratory  (deerl)  in  the  civil  engineer-\\ning  department  of  monash  university,  and  the  sample  preparation\\nwas  conducted  in  accordance  with  the  astm  standard  for  tri-axial\\ncompressive  testing  (astm  d7012-10  (2010)).  in  order  to  maintain\\nconsistency,  all  the  samples  were  cored  to  22.5  mm  in  diameter\\nusing  the  same  block  of  granite  at  the  same  orientation.  during  the\\nsampling  great  care  was  taken  to  obtain  samples  with  the  same\\ncrystalline  orientation,  and  samples  with  different  crystalline  ori-\\nentation,  internal  layers  and  visible  cracks  were  discarded.  it  should\\nbe  noted  that  coring-induced  rock-microstructure  alteration  is  an\\nimportant  aspect  to  consider  in  laboratory  experiments,  although\\nfew  studies  have  considered  this  effect.  to  avoid  such  issues,  a  very\\nsmall  coring  rate  was  adopted  and  water  was  used  as  a  lubricant.\\nthe  cored  specimens  were  then  cut  into  45  mm  high  cylinders  and\\nboth  ends  of  the  specimens  were  ground  to  produce  two  parallel\\nsurfaces  perpendicular  to  the  axes  of  the  cylindrical  specimens.\\n\\n2.3.  experimental  procedure\\n\\ntri-axial  experiments  were  conducted  on  samples  under  four\\ndifferent  conﬁning  pressures  (10,  30,  60  and  90  mpa)  and  four\\ndifferent  temperatures  (rt,  100,  200,  300 ◦c).  these  experimen-\\ntal  conditions  were  selected,  because  the  most  preferable  hot  dry\\nrock  systems  are  generally  located  at  depths  of  2.5–3.5  km  and\\nhave  around  70  mpa–120  mpa   conﬁning  pressures  (assuming  the\\nreservoir  rock  density  is  equal  to  2500  kg/m3)  and  temperatures  of\\n\\n200–350 ◦c  (breede  et  al.,  2013).  the  different  conﬁning  pressures\\nand  temperatures  were  selected  to  simulate  the  reservoir  depth\\neffect  and  to  obtain  a  sufﬁcient  data  set  to  understand  the  failure\\ncriteria  under  different  temperatures.\\n\\nthe  complete  arrangement  of  the  tri-axial  cell  is  shown  in\\nfig.  3.  the  prepared  sample  was  ﬁrst  placed  inside  the  cell  and  the\\nrequired  conﬁning  pressure  was   then  applied  using  a  silicon  oil  sys-\\ntem,  and  an  annealed  copper  sleeve  was  used  to  isolate  the  sample\\nfrom  the  conﬁning  liquid  (refer  to  fig.  3(b).  a  mica-insulated  metal\\nband  heater  was   used  to  heat  the  pressure  cell  and  consequently\\nthe  rock  sample.  the  temperatures  of  the  cell  were  adjusted  using  a\\ncontroller  and  a  constant  small  heating  rate  of  2.5 ◦c/min  was  used\\nto  prevent  micro-structural  damage  due  to  sudden  thermal  shocks.\\ntwo  separate  thermocouples  were  used  to  achieve  precise  temper-\\nature  control,  and  the  reading  of  the  thermocouple  installed  inside\\nthe  cell  (fig.  3(b))  was   recorded  by  the  data  acquisition  system.  the\\nother  thermocouple  that  was   attached  to  the  barrel  (fig.  3(a))  was\\nused  to  control  the  band  heater.  furthermore,  the  barrel  and  the\\ntop  of  the  pressure  cell  were  covered  using  an  insulating  blanket\\nto  reduce  heat  loss  during  the  experiments  and  to  minimise  the\\ninﬂuence  of  air  ﬂows  towards  the  cell.  all  the  tests  were  started\\nonce  the  system  had  achieved  a  steady  state  to  ensure  uniformity\\nin  temperature  and  pressure  across  the  sample.  equilibrium  was\\nensured  by  monitoring  the  conﬁnement  pump  volume  and  the\\nthermocouple  readings  inside  the  cell  (located  very  close  to  the\\nspecimen).  under  steady-state  conditions,  constant  pump  volume\\nand  constant  temperature  were  observed  and  testing  was   initiated.\\na\\n  constant  loading  pump  ﬂow  rate  of  1  ml/min  was  adopted  for\\nall  the  test  specimens  and  the  converted  displacement  rate  was\\n0.05  mm/min.  it  should  be  noted  that  a  small  shaft  resistance  exists\\nas  a  result  of  the  sealing  of  the  hydraulic  cylinder,  and  this  effect\\nwas  considered  in  the  calibration  of  the  loading  cell.  the  sealing\\nresistance  was  obtained  by  measuring  the  pump  pressure  to  initi-\\nate  a  movement  in  the  loading  shaft,  and  this  was   deducted  from\\neach  pressure  reading  to  eliminate  the  resistance  of  the  sealing  dur-\\n\\n\\x0cw.g.p.  kumari  et  al.  /  geothermics

curvilinear  trends  from  initial  loading  to  the  peak  value,\\nbeyond  which  strain  softening  occurred,  causing  a  rapid  stress  drop\\nto  a  residual  value.  increasing  peak  stress  with  increasing  conﬁn-\\ning  pressure  can  be  observed,  which  is  to  be  expected,  according\\nto  typical  mohr-coulomb  type  brittle  failure  (paterson  and  wong,\\n2005).\\n\\ntraditionally,  rock  failure  in  compression  can  occur  in  two\\nmain  ways;  (a)  dilatancy  and  failure  by  strain  softening  under\\nrelatively  low  conﬁning  pressures  and  (b)  failure  by  strain  harden-\\ning  under  elevated  conﬁning  pressures,  and  a  transitional  regime\\nmay   be  observed  at  intermediate  pressures.  these  transitional  fail-\\nure  modes  have  been  referred  to  as  “quasi-brittle”,  and  complex\\nlocalized  features  such  as  conjugate  shear  bands  can  be  observed\\nunder  such  conditions  (klein  et  al.,  2001;  gajo  et  al.,  2004).  by\\nvisual  inspection  of  the  post-failure  samples,  important  informa-\\ntion  about  the  alteration  of  the  granite  failure  mechanism  with\\nconﬁning  pressures  and  temperatures  can  be  identiﬁed.  post-\\nfailure  images  (fig.  5)  were  therefore  collected  after  each  test.\\n\\naccording  to  the  post-failure  images,  specimens  that  failed\\nat  10–60  mpa   conﬁning  pressures  mainly  failed  by  shear  local-\\nization  along  an  inclined  macroscopic  shear  band  with  a  single\\nshear  zone  across  each  sample.  however,  samples  tested  at  higher\\nconﬁnements  of  90  mpa   and  120  mpa   (at  100 ◦c)  exhibited  strain\\nhardening  characteristics  after  achieving  the  peak  stress,  and  sev-\\neral  conjugate  shear  bands  could  be  observed  on  the  cylindrical\\nsample  surface,  instead  of  the  single  shear  band  observed  earlier.\\nthis  characteristic  was  signiﬁcant  at  120  mpa   conﬁning  pressure.\\nhowever,  it  should  be  noted  that  only  one  test  was   conducted\\nat  120  mpa   conﬁnement,  because  at  such  high  conﬁning  pres-\\nsures  the  corresponding  failure  load  of  granite  exceeds  the  bottom\\npedestal’s  load-bearing  capacity.  further,  a  progressive  reduction\\nwas  observed  in  the  failure  plane  angle  with  respect  to  the  minor\\nprincipal  stress  direction  with  increasing  conﬁning  pressure,  which\\nimplies  a  reduction  in  friction  angle,  possibly  due  to  the  greater\\nquasi-brittle  behaviour  that  was   shown  by  granite  samples  at\\nhigher  conﬁning  pressures  (wong  et  al.,  2001).\\n\\n3.2.  effect  of  temperature  and  conﬁning  pressure  on  mechanical\\nproperties  of  strathbogie  granite\\n\\nfig.  6  illustrates  the  inﬂuence  of  temperature  on  the  deviatoric\\nstress  of  the  tested  granite  under  each  conﬁnement.  as  the  ﬁg-\\nure  shows,  the  inﬂuence  of  conﬁnement  is  more  signiﬁcant  than\\nthat  of  temperature  in  the  temperature  range  considered  here.\\nwong  and  brace  (1979)  conﬁrm  that  at  lower  conﬁning  pressures\\nconsiderable  thermal  cracking  occurs  at  relatively  low  tempera-\\ntures.  if  thermal  cracking  is  responsible  for  the  reduction  in  failure\\nstrength,  a  sharp  reduction  in  deviatoric  stress  with  increasing\\ntemperature  (with  suppression  of  thermal  cracks)  should  be  exhib-\\nited  under  unconﬁned  pressure  condition.  however,  based  on  the\\nexperimental  results,  under  unconﬁned  conditions,  up  to  100 ◦c,\\n17.6%  of  increment  in  deviatoric  stress  is  followed  by  2.5%  and\\n10.5%  reductions  at  200 ◦c  and  300 ◦c,  respectively.  however,  when\\nconﬁnement  was  applied,  strength  reduction  was  initiated  after\\n  higher  temperature  of  200 ◦c,  mainly  due  to  the  inhibition  of\\na\\nthermal  cracks  by  induced  compressive  force.  thermal  cracking  is\\ntherefore  an  important  strength  property  alteration  mechanism  in\\nreservoir  rocks  under  certain  conﬁning  pressure  conditions.\\n\\na\\n\\n  clear

respectively)  and  the  researchers\\ntherefore  did  not  pay  close  attention  to  reservoir  rock  behaviour\\nunder  relatively  low  geothermal  temperature  ranges  (<300 ◦c).  this\\nwas  the  focus  of  the  present  study,  according  to  which  there  is\\nan  initial  strengthening  and  stiffening  in  granite  with  increasing\\ntemperature  at  low  temperatures  (up  to  200 ◦c),  and  increasing\\nthe  temperature  beyond  a  certain  value  causes  a  gradual  reduc-\\ntion  in  failure  stress  with  increasing  temperature.  elastic  modulus\\nis  an  important  mechanical  property  of  any  reservoir  rock,  and\\n\\ndescribes  the  brittle  characteristics  of  the  rock  mass.  it  is  therefore\\noften  used  to  evaluate  many  in-situ  stress  applications,  including\\nwellbore  stability,  fracturing  possibility  and  tectonic  stress  distri-\\nbution  (heard  and  page,  1982).  the  temperature-dependent  brittle\\nproperties  (elastic  modulus)  of  the  tested  granite  were  then  eval-\\nuated.  the  elastic  region  of  each  stress-strain  curve  was  used  to\\ncalculate  the  temperature-  and  pressure-dependent  young’s  mod-\\nuli  (e)  and  the  results  are  shown  in  fig.  7.  the  axial  strain  was\\nmeasured  using  lvdts  attached  to  the  loading  ram  with  a  linearity\\n±0.1%  f.s  (full  scale)  (±0.0075  mm)   and  inﬁnite  resolu-\\nerror  of \\ntion  (no  hysteresis).  an  increment  of  the  modulus  of  strathbogie\\ngranite  with  increasing  temperature  up  to  200 ◦c  can  be  observed,\\nand  further  increase  of  temperature  (to  300 ◦c)  causes  the  elastic\\nmodulus  to  be  slightly  reduced  for  any  conﬁnement.  this  trend  is\\n\\n\\x0ca\\n\\n‘brittle’  or \\n\\n  general  increment  in  elastic  modulus  with  increasing  con-\\nﬁnement  can  be  observed  until  90  mpa,  and  a  further  increase\\nof  conﬁnement  (to  120  mpa)  reduces  the  young’s  modulus  con-\\nsiderably.  with \\nincreasing  conﬁning  stress  additional  plastic\\ndeformation  occurs,  exhibiting  strain-hardening  characteristics  in\\ngranite  under  high  conﬁnements.  however,  within  the  range  of\\nthe  experiments  conducted  (10  mpa–120  mpa)  it  cannot  be  deﬁni-\\ntively  identiﬁed  as  a \\n’ductile’  regime.  however,  the\\nstrain-hardening  behaviour  observed  at  120  mpa   indicates  tran-\\nsitional  characteristics  and  this  can  be  identiﬁed  as  ‘quasi-brittle’\\nbehaviour  (klein  et  al.,  2001).  the  initial  young’s  modulus  reduc-\\ntion  with  increasing  conﬁnement  was  observed  by  heard  and  page\\n(1982),  who   conducted  tests  up  to  55  mpa   conﬁning  pressure.  how-\\never,  the  latter  behaviour  was  not  observed  by  these  researchers.\\ninterestingly,  according  to  the  research  literature,  at  low  tempera-\\ntures  (<200 ◦c)  some  granite  types  are  more  temperature-sensitive,\\nwhile  in  contrast,  some  granites  are  more  temperature-sensitive\\nat  high  temperatures.  the  initial  strength  enhancement  is  more\\nsigniﬁcant  for  coarse-grained  granites  and  granodiorite  than  for\\nﬁne-grained  granites.  for  example,  according  to  heard  and  page\\n(1982),  stripa  granite  is  more  sensitive  to  temperature  at  rela-\\ntively  low  temperatures  (<200 ◦c),  and  westerly  granite  is  more\\nsensitive  to  temperature  at  high  temperatures  (>200 ◦c).  such  con-\\ntradictory  behaviours  may   occur  in  granite  due  to  the  different\\ngrain  size  distributions,  grain  orientations,  mineralogical  composi-\\ntions  and  heterogeneity  of  different  granite  types.  this  indicates  the\\nimportance  of  studying  the  mineralogical  composition  and  micro-\\nstructural  inﬂuence  of  granites  on  such  on  temperature-dependent\\nstrength  variations.\\n\\n3.3.  effect  of  temperature  on  shear  strength  parameters  of\\nstrathbogie  granite\\n\\nfig.  8  illustrates  the  variation  of  deviatoric  stress  of  the  tested\\ngranite  with  conﬁning  pressure  for  each  temperature.  the  ﬁgure\\nshows  that  increasing  conﬁnement  causes  the  granite’s  deviatoric\\nstress  to  increase  non-linearly  and  gradually  come  to  a  steady  state.\\nthis  is  consistent  with  similar  previous  studies,  which  have  clearly\\nshown  the  enhancement  of  rock  strength  with  increasing  conﬁne-\\nment,  and  the  increasing  rate  is  reduced  with  increasing  conﬁning\\npressure  (barton,  2013;  singh  et  al.,  2011).  this  is  because  at  low\\nconﬁning  pressures  there  is  a  high  dilation  potential.  therefore,  the\\nability  to  open  rock  micro-cracks  is  high,  resulting  in  higher  fric-\\ntion  angles.  however,  this  dilation  potential  and  the  corresponding\\ntendency  for  micro-cracks  to  open  are  suppressed  with  increasing\\nconﬁnement,  resulting  in  lower  friction  angles  at  higher  conﬁn-\\ning  pressures.  therefore,  the  failure  mechanism  of  the  rocks  shifts\\nfrom  brittle  to  ductile  with  increasing  conﬁnement,  changing  the\\nshape  of  the  mohr-coulomb  failure  envelope,  and  according  to\\nbarton  (1976),  at  critical  conﬁning  pressure  the  mohr-coulomb  fail-\\nure  envelope  reaches  a  zero  gradient.  this  has  also  been  shown\\nby  hoek  (1983).  the  present  study  has  clearly  identiﬁed  this  rock\\nbehaviour  in  the  mohr-coulomb  failure  envelopes  developed  for\\neach  temperature  condition  (refer  to  fig.  9).  according  to  fig.  9,\\nthe  traditional  linear  mohr-coulomb  criteria  are  applicable  only  in\\nthe  brittle  region  of  the  failure  envelope,  and  at  higher  conﬁne-\\n\\nw.g.p.  kumari  et  al.  /  geothermics  65  (2017)  44–59\\n\\nconsistent  with  the  temperature-dependent  strength  behaviour  of\\nthe  granite  described  above.  the  reason  for  the  initial  elastic  mod-\\nule  increment  may  be  that  the  specimen  becomes  more  brittle  at\\nthe  initial  temperature  ranges  due  to  thermally-induced  volumet-\\nric  expansion  and  the  associated  pore  volume  reduction.  the  later\\nslight  reduction  of  young’s  modulus  with  increasing  temperature\\nexhibits  an  enhancement  in  ductile  behaviour  (quasi-brittle  char-\\nacteristics)  with  further  increase  of  temperature.  this  is  possibly\\ndue  to  the  increased  crack  density  caused  by  the  induced  thermal\\ncrack  development  and  the  related  weakening  of  the  granite.\\n\\n600\\n\\n500\\n\\n400\\n\\n300\\n\\n200\\n\\n100\\n\\n0\\n\\n50 \\n\\nσ1-σ3(mpa)\\n\\n0 \\n\\n100 \\n\\ntemperature (ºc)\\n\\n200 \\n\\nunconfined

 extreme\\nvalue  may   cause  weakening  of  the  grain  boundaries,  dependent  on\\nthe  anisotropy  of  the  rock  matrix  (due  to  potentially  existing  dis-\\ntinct  mineral  compounds  in  granite  those  may   contain  different\\nthermo-elastic  moduli  and  this  may   causes  to  generate  differ-\\nent  internal  stresses  with  heating).  according  to  wong  and  brace\\n(1979),  increasing  the  temperature  causes  the  induction  of  thermal\\ncracks  in  the  rock  mass  due  to  the  associated  generation  of  internal\\nstresses  (eq.

(2))\\nexceeds  the  crack  closure  pressure  with  increasing  temperature,\\nthermal  cracks  form  and  further  increase  of  temperature  provides\\nthe  surface  energy  required  for  the  propagation  of  the  initiated\\ncrack  (zuo  et  al.,  2007).  this  results  in  alteration  of  the  grain-to-\\ngrain  contacts  in  the  rock  matrix,  which  leads  to  reduced  cohesion\\nat  higher  temperatures.  in  the  case  of  the  variation  of  friction  angle\\nwith  increasing  temperature,  the  granite  friction  angle  appears  to\\nremain  steady  up  to  around  100 ◦c  (52◦)  and  then  slightly  increases\\nwith  increasing  temperature  (54◦ at  200  and  300 ◦ c,  respectively).\\nthe  friction  between  grain-to-grain  contacts  may  be  altered  by\\nthe  thermally-induced  micro-structural  modiﬁcations.  however,\\nthis  effect  on  grain  contact  is  expected  to  be  smaller  at  relatively\\nlow  temperatures,  resulting  in  relatively  steady  friction  angle  with\\nincreasing  temperature  at  lower  temperatures.  however,  a  slight\\n\\nments  non-linearity  must  be  taken  into  account.  in  addition  to  the\\nconﬁnement,  according  to  this  study,  increasing  temperature  also\\nalters  the  failure  envelope  of  granite.  an  initial  increment  in  devi-\\natoric  stress  with  increasing  temperature  can  be  observed  up  to\\n200 ◦c  and  further  increase  of  temperature  (to  300 ◦c)  causes  it  to\\nbe  slightly  reduced.\\n\\nthe  temperature-dependent  shear  parameters  of  granite  were\\ninvestigated  next,  and  the  shear  parameters  can  be  obtained\\nfrom  the  mohr-coulomb  failure  envelope.  as  suggested  by  singh\\net  al.

(2007),  large  local  plastic  deformations  and\\nextremely  rough  cleavage  fractures  occur  at  relatively  low  tem-\\nperatures.  moreover,  due  to  the  volume  expansion,  the  distance\\nbetween  the  interfaces  of  the  individual  minerals  decreases  with\\nthe  enhancement  of  their  mutual  attraction,  and  the  strength  of\\nthe  bonds  increases  (dmitriev,  1972).  both  of  these  phenomena  can\\n\\nbe  considered  to  explain  the  stress  strengthening  of  granite  under\\nrelatively  low  temperatures  when  subjected  to  conﬁning  pressures.\\n\\n3.4.  analysis  of  fracturing  behaviour  using  ae  technology\\n\\nacoustic  emission  (ae)  detection  technology  is  a  powerful  non-\\ndestructive  tool  to  study  crack  propagation  processes  in  brittle\\nmaterials,  including  the  stages  of  crack  initiation,  growth  and  crack\\ndamage  (lockner,  1993).  when  a  brittle  material  is  under  stress,\\nstrain  energy  is  released  during  the  development  of  new  cracks  or\\nthe  widening  of  existing  cracks.  this  energy  is  released  in  the  form\\nof  elastic  stress  waves  from  the  crack  tips,  and  can  be  captured  and\\nampliﬁed  by  an  ae  system.  ae  detection  technology  has  therefore\\nbeen  widely  used  in  a  number  of  previous  studies  to  understand\\nthe  crack  development  mechanism  in  brittle  materials  (chang  and\\nlee,  2004;  lei  et  al.,  2000;  moura  et  al.,  2005).\\n\\nby  incorporating  the  crack  propagation  pattern  into  the  stress-\\nstrain  relationship  of  the  cracking  material,  the  crack  development\\nprocess  can  be  divided  into  several  stages.  hoek  and  bieniawski\\n(1965)  divided  crack  formation  into  ﬁve  main  stages:  crack  clo-\\nsure,  crack  initiation,  secondary  cracking,  crack  coalescence  and\\ncrack  damage.  later,  ranjith  et  al.

(1997),  the  development  of  local  stress  concentrations  leads\\nto  the  initiation  of  many  intra-granular  micro-cracks  in  the  rock\\nmass,  and  the  crack  density  increases  with  increasing  deviatoric\\nstress  and  tends  to  merge  on  reaching  the  peak  stress,  resulting  in\\nstrain  softening  and  shear  localization.  these  damage  processes  are\\nclearly  identiﬁed  by  the  intense  ae  activities  in  the  ﬁeld  (chang  and\\nlee,  2004).  ae  technology  was  therefore  used  to  investigate  the  pro-\\ngressive  fracturing  behaviour  in  strathbogie  granite  under  tri-axial\\nconditions.  fig.  11  illustrates  the  cumulative  ae  events  with  axial\\nstress  at  various  pressures  and  temperatures  for  the  tested  spec-\\nimens.  the  corresponding  variations  of  deviatoric  stress  against\\nstrain  are  also  included  in  the  same  plots  to  identify  the  stress\\nthresholds  for  crack  closure,  crack  initiation  and  crack  damage\\n(table  4).  the  very  high  ae  counts  in  strathbogie  granite  at  dilatancy\\nin  the  pre-failure  stage  are  due  to  the  fact  that  ae  waves  generate\\nwhen  the  local  shear  stress  concentration  at  a  grain  contact  is  suf-\\nﬁciently  high  to  rupture  the  grain  boundaries,  and  frictional  slips\\nand  grain  rotations  may   occur  once  the  grain  contacts  have  lost\\ntheir  cohesion.\\n\\nin  the  present  study,  crack  threshold  ratios  were  deﬁned  to  iden-\\ntify  the  temperature  and  pressure-dependent  crack  propagation  in\\nthe  tested  granite  as  follows,  and  fig.  12  shows  the  crack  propaga-\\ntion  stress  threshold  ratios  of  granite  specimens  tested  at  various\\nconﬁning

loading  for  higher  conﬁning  pres-\\nsures.  however,  the  crack  damage  stress  increases  with  increasing\\nconﬁnement  due  to  the  inﬂuence  of  conﬁning  pressure  on  thermal\\ncrack  development  and  the  suppression  of  the  extension/widening\\nof  existing  micro-cracks.  according  to  fig.  12,  in  the  tempera-\\nture  range  considered  here,  three  tendencies  can  be  identiﬁed\\nwith  increasing  conﬁning  pressure:  increase  of  the  elastic  defor-\\nmation  region,  decrease  of  the  stable  crack  propagation  region,  and\\nincrease  of  the  unstable  crack  propagation  region.  the  crack  initia-\\ntion  stress  threshold  also  progressively  increases  with  increasing\\nconﬁning  pressure,  which  can  be  attributed  to  the  fact  that  the\\nbrittle  behaviour  of  rock  specimens  at  lower  conﬁning  pressures\\nchanges  to  quasi-brittle  behaviour  with  increasing  conﬁning  pres-\\nsure.  this  is  because  the  suppression  of  micro-crack  development\\nis  less  at  low  conﬁning  pressures,  and  therefore  sudden  fail-\\nures  mostly  occur,  and  the  beginning  of  crack  initiation  occurs\\n\\nat  earlier  stages  of  deviatoric  loading  at  high  conﬁning  pressures\\ndue  to  the  higher  normal  stress  acting  on  micro-cracks,  result-\\ning  in  limited  progression  of  cracking  before  failure.  in  relation\\nto  the  temperature  effect,  increasing  the  temperature  causes  an\\ninitial  increment  in  the  crack  propagation  stress  threshold,  fol-\\nlowed  by  a  slight  reduction  for  all  the  temperature  conditions\\nconsidered.  for  example,  at  30  mpa   conﬁnement,  the  crack  dam-\\nage  stress  threshold  ratios  increased  by  around  6.8%,  10.5%  with\\nincreasing  temperature  from  room  temperature  to  100  and  200 ◦c,\\nrespectively,  and  reduced  by  around  4.0%  when  the  temperature\\nincreased  to  300 ◦c.  this  implies  that  at  low  temperatures  a  sup-\\npressed  micro-crack  development  mechanism  is  dominant,  and\\nincreasing  the  temperature  causes  crack  damage  to  occur  at  ear-\\nlier  loading  stages.  interestingly,  at  60  mpa   conﬁnement  the  crack\\ndamage  stress  threshold  ratio  increased  by  around  4.9%,  5.4%,\\n2.6%  with  increasing  temperature  from  room  to  100,  200  and\\n300 ◦c,  respectively.  this  exhibits  the  cumulative  effect  of  tem-\\nperature  and  pressure  micro-crack  development  in  the  rock  mass.\\nat  relatively  low  temperatures,  micro-crack  propagation  may  be\\ninhibited  by  the  thermally-induced  plasticity  mechanism  which\\noccurs  at  crack  tips  and  the  increased  bonding  strength  through\\nthermally-induced  rock  matrix  expansion  (which  increases  crack\\nstress  thresholds).  however,  further  increase  of  temperature  cre-\\nates  thermally-induced  cracks  and  causes  the  grain  boundary\\ncracks  to  widen,  resulting  in  early  crack  damage.  further,  with  the\\ninﬂuence  of  conﬁnement,  micro-crack  development  is  suppressed,\\ncausing  a  relatively  low  increment  of  crack  damage  stress

identify  the  interior  correspondences  of  the  above-described\\ntemperature-dependent  mechanical  behaviour  of  granite.  sem  and\\noptical  microscopic  analyses  were  performed  on  thin

identify  the  microstructural\\nbehaviour  at  200 ◦c,  at  which  the  highest  strength  increment  was\\nobserved,  and  400 ◦c,  at  which  clear  thermally-induced  rock  mass\\nweakening  was  observed.  a  specimen  at  room  temperature  was\\nused  as  a  control.\\n\\nbased  on  optical  microscope  imaging,  mineralogical  assembling\\nin  the  granite  specimen  could  be  identiﬁed  by  the  colour  and  tex-\\nture  of  each  of  the  mineral  assemblages.  further,  a  detailed  sem\\nstudy  was   performed  using  scanning  electron  imaging  (sei)  and\\nbsei  back-scatter  electron  imaging  (bsei)  techniques.  bsei  images\\ntaken  at  low  magniﬁcations  clearly  show  different  mineral  assem-\\nblages  and  grain  boundaries  (see  fig.  14).  using  energy-dispersive\\nx-ray  (edx)  technology  with  aztec  oxford  instruments,  chem-\\nical  component  mapping  was  generated  in  each  specimen,  and\\neach  mineral  was  identiﬁed  qualitatively.  the  bright  colour  images\\nobserved  in  edx  images  indicate  higher  concentration  (higher\\nenergy  dispersion)  while  dark  colour  areas  indicate  lower  concen-\\ntration  (lower  energy  dispersion).  based  on  the  spectrum  of  each\\npoint  (point  id),  the  corresponding  mineral  was  identiﬁed  and  a\\nmap   spectrum  provided  overall  elements  available

observed\\nin  larger  crystals  (crystals  greater  than  0.5  mm)   and  smaller  crys-\\ntals  remained  un-parted  even  at  400 ◦c.  for  strathbogie  granite,\\nthermally-induced  intra-granular  micro-cracks  seem  to  play  a  sig-\\nniﬁcant  role  at  relatively  low  temperatures,  probably  due  to  the\\npresence  of  relatively  high  k  feldspar  and  biotite  contents.  simi-\\nlar  observations  have  been  reported  in  bauer  and  johnson’s  (1979)\\nstudy  conducted  for  charcoal  granite,  where  intra-granular  micro-\\ncracks  predominantly  occur  compared  to  grain  boundary  cracks.\\nthe  sem  analysis  is  also  consistent  with  this  ﬁnding,  which  exhibits\\ninhibition  of  micro-crack  development  followed  by  micro-cracking\\nat  relatively  high  temperatures.\\n\\nthe  crack  propagation  process  in  any  rock  mass  is  largely\\ninﬂuenced  by  the  mineralogical  composition,  because  cracks  nor-\\nmally  propagate  through  weaker  planes  of  the  rock  mass.  since\\ngranite  is  an  igneous  type  of  rock,  two  main  types  of  thermally-\\ninduced  cracking  modes  can  be  identiﬁed:  inter-granular  and  intra-\\ngranular.  the  amount  of  inter-granular  or  intra-granular  cracking\\nis  dependent  on  the  stress  state,  rock  type  and  mineralogy  of\\nthe  rock  mass.  inter-granular  cracks  occur  along  grain  boundaries,\\npre-existing  faults  and  micro-cracks  of  the  rock,  while  intra-\\ngranular  cracks  occur  through  weaker  mineralogical  constituents\\n(kranz,  1983).  for  example,  k-  feldspar  and  biotite  are  weaker\\n\\nmineralogical  constituents  due  to  their  large  crystals  (>10  mm),\\nas  crystals  greater  than  2–3  mm  in  size  are  generally  deﬁned  as\\nweaker  mineralogical  constituents  compared  to  equi-dimensional\\nsmall  crystals  like  quartz  (homand-etienne  and  houpert,  1989).\\nbased  on  experimental  results,  intra-granular  cracking  is  highly\\ntemperature-dependent  due  to  the  temperature-  dependent  dis-\\nlocations  in  the  rocks.  this  is  because  different  mineralogical\\ncomponents  have  different  thermo-elastic  moduli  and  thermal\\nconductivities  (kranz,  1983;  dwivedi  et  al.,  2008).\\n\\nthese  observations  suggest  that  micro-cracking  in  granite  is\\nhighly  temperature-  dependent,  as  evidenced  by  the  previously\\nobserved  initial  strength  gain  followed  by  slight  strength  reduc-\\ntion  with  increasing  temperature  in  the  tested  granite.  however,\\nthis  shows  that  granite  needs  to  be  heated  to  a  sufﬁcient  tempera-\\nture  to  cause  thermal  cracks  in  it  and  therefore,  heating  to  a  lower\\ntemperature  may   only  cause  a  strength  gain  through  the  thermal\\nexpansion  of  the  rock  matrix.  this  is  consistent  with  the  results\\nof  bauer  and  johnson  (1979).  the  mechanical  properties  of  char-\\ncoal  granite  in  their  study  remained  relatively  steady  until  200 ◦c,\\nand  westerly  granite  exhibited  a  signiﬁcant  thermal  dependency,\\neven  at  relatively  low  temperatures  (<200 ◦c).  in  homand-etienne\\nand  houpert  (1989)  study,  the  variation  of  uni-axial  compressive\\nstrength  of  both  semones  and  remiremont  granites  is  insigniﬁcant\\nuntil  400 ◦c,  followed  by  signiﬁcant  reductions  at  higher  temper-\\natures.  these  results  indicate  the  dependency  of  mineralogical\\ncomposition  and  grain  size  distribution  on  the  temperature-  depen-\\ndent  mechanical  behaviour  in  various  types  of  granites.  however,\\n\\n\\x0cw.g.p.  kumari  et  al.  /  geothermics  65  (2017)  44–59

conclusions\\n\\na\\n\\n  series  of  tri-axial  strength  tests  was  conducted  on  australian\\nstrathbogie  granite  under  four  different  conﬁning  pressures  (10,  30,\\n60,  90  mpa)  and  four  different  temperatures  (rt,  100,  200,  300 ◦c),\\nsimulating  various  geothermal  reservoir  conditions.  the  following\\nconclusions  can  be  drawn:\\n• mechanical  behaviour  of  the  tested  granite  is  inﬂuenced  by  both\\nreservoir  depth  and  temperature,  and  the  depth  effect  is  much\\ngreater  than  the  temperature  effect.\\n• granite \\nlocated  at  relatively  smaller  depths  appears  to  fail\\nthrough  shear  localization  and  increasing  depth  may  cause  this\\nto  change  to  ductile  failure  through  strain  hardening.  a  progres-\\nsive  enhancement  in  stress  threshold  with  increasing  conﬁning\\npressure  is  observed  in  strathbogie  granite.  such  behaviours\\nexhibit  greater  strength  and  lower  brittle  characteristics  in  gran-\\nite  located  at  greater  depths.\\n• increasing  of  temperature  causes  granite’s  strength  to  be\\nenhanced  up  to  a  certain  temperature  (around  200 ◦c  for  strath-\\nbogie  granite)  through  the  possible  thermal  expansion  of  the\\nrock  matrix  and  further  increasing  of  temperature  may   cause  it\\nto  weaken  by  inducing  thermal  cracks.  this  was  conﬁrmed  by\\nthe  micro-structural  analysis,  which  did  not  reveal  any  notice-\\nable  amount  of  thermally-induced  micro-cracking  in  strathbogie\\ngranite  up  to  200 ◦c,  and  heating  of  the  granite  to  a  greater  tem-\\nperature  as  400 ◦c  caused  many  intra-granular  cracks  in  quartz\\nand  feldspar  and  some  grain  boundary  cracks  between  quartz  and\\nfeldspar  minerals.  furthermore,  according  to  ae  analysis,  increas-\\ning  the  temperature  ﬁrst  causes  the  crack  propagation  stress\\nthreshold  to  increase  and  further  increasing  of  the  temperature\\ncauses  it  to  be  slightly  reduced.  this  indicates  a  suppression  of\\nmicro-cracks  at  low  temperatures  by  matrix  expansion  and  the\\ndevelopment  of  micro-cracks  through  thermally-induced  dam-\\nage  at  higher  temperatures.\\n• finally  an  attempt  was  made  to  improve  the  conventional  mohr-\\ncoulomb  failure  criteria  for  geothermal  reservoirs  with  extreme\\npressures  and  temperatures,  because  the  conventional  criteria\\nare  not  applicable  to  extreme  conditions.\\n\\nacknowledgements\\n\\nthis  research  project  is  funded  by

application  of  most  of  them  for  geothermal\\nreservoirs \\nin-situ  model  parame-\\nters  required  when  considering  the  available  high-pressure  and\\nhigh-temperature  environment  in  underground  reservoirs.  of  the\\nvarious  failure  criteria,  the  mohr-coulomb  failure  criteria  have\\nbeen  extensively  used  in  the  ﬁeld  and  have  made  a  signiﬁcant  con-\\ntribution  to  the  determination  of  rock  mass  failure.  however,  they\\nhave  some  major  limitations,  including  ignoring  the  intermediate\\nstress  (cid:2)2 inﬂuence  (which  has  been  proven  to  have  a  substantial\\ninﬂuence  on  rock  strength)  and  the  assumed  linearity  (the  strength\\ncriteria  of  rock  are  non-linear  in  reality).  after  re-analyzing  thou-\\nsands  of  reported  triaxial  experiments  and  combining  the  critical\\nstate  concept  proposed  by  barton  (1976),  singh  et  al.  (2011)  pro-\\nposed  a  non-linear  mohr-coulomb  failure  criterion.  according  to\\nthe  ﬁndings  of  singh  et  al.  (2011),  the  mohr-coulomb  shear  strength\\nparameters  should  only  be  obtained  by  performing  conventional\\ntri-axial  tests  under  low  conﬁning  stresses  (in  the  linear  region  of\\nthe  mohr-coulomb  failure  envelope).  according  to  their  statistical\\nanalysis,  (cid:2)cc ≈\\n  (cid:2)crit,  where  (cid:2)c and  (cid:2) crit are  uni-axial  compressive\\nstrength  and  critical  conﬁning  pressure,  respectively.  the  modiﬁed\\nmohr-coulomb  failure  criterion  proposed  by  singh  et  al.  is  given\\nbelow:\\n(cid:2)1 −\\n  (cid:2)3 =\\nwhere,  (cid:2)ci ≈\\n\\n

the  improved  mohr-coulomb  failure  criteria\\ncannot  be  directly  applied  to  geothermal  reservoir  rocks  at  extreme\\npressures  and  temperatures,  because  the  strength  response  is\\naltered  by  the  thermal  effect  (heuze,  1983).  to  date,  no  extensive\\nstudy  has  captured  this  thermal  response  in  the  improved  mohr-\\ncoulomb  failure  criteria.  such  a  realistic  approach  is  necessary\\nfor  deep  underground  engineering  applications  like  geothermal\\nenergy  extraction.  the  concepts  of  barton  (1976)  and  singh  et  al.\\n(2011)  are  therefore  incorporated  into  the  temperature  inﬂuence\\nin  this  study  and  an  attempt  is  made  to  propose  novel  strength  cri-\\nteria  for  geothermal  reservoir  rocks  based  on

granite\\ngeological disposal\\n\\ncrystalline rocks are potential host rock types for the construction of high-level radioactive waste (hlw)\\nrepositories. a better understanding of thermal conductivity of rocks is essential to safe evaluation and engineering optimization of a hlw disposal system in the rock at depth. in the present study, experimental investigations\\non the thermal conductivity characteristics of 47 pairs of granitic rock specimens were conducted using the\\ntransient plane source (tps) method. the specimens were collected from borehole cores in the beishan area,\\nwhich is being considered as the most potential candidate area for china's hlw repository. to evaluate geological\\nnature of the rocks, mineralogical compositions of the rocks were identiﬁed, and porosity of the specimens was\\nmeasured. the thermal conductivities of the specimens under dry and water-saturated conditions were\\ndetermined, and the effect of water saturation on the thermal conductivity was investigated. in addition, the\\ninﬂuence of temperature and axial compression stress on the thermal conductivity of dry specimens was studied.\\nthe results revealed that the thermal conductivity of tested rocks was dependent on water saturation, temperature and compression stress. based on the obtained data, some models considering porosity were established for\\ndescribing the thermal conductivity characteristics of the tested rocks. furthermore, when the rocks have a\\nsimilar porosity, the quartz content dominates the thermal conductivity, and there exists an obvious increase\\nof the thermal conductivity with increasing quartz content. the test results constitute the ﬁrst systematic\\nmeasurements on the beishan granitic rocks and can further be used for the development of thermal models\\nfor predicting thermal response near the underground excavations for hlw disposal.\\n\\n© 2016 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.\\n\\n1. introduction\\n\\ndeep geological disposal has been the internationally accepted\\napproach for the permanent disposal of high level radioactive waste\\n(hlw) generated from nuclear power plants and other nuclear facilities. an hlw repository can be constructed in a host rock at a depth of\\nseveral hundred meters below the ground surface. the design of hlw\\nrepositories often relies on a multi-barrier system, which typically consists of the natural geological barrier and an engineered barrier system.\\nas the last defense to the biosphere, the natural geological barrier\\n(i.e., the host rock) plays a critical role in ensuring the long-term safety\\nof the hlw repositories. because crystalline rocks such as granite and\\ndiorite have low permeability, high solidity, and good excavation

geology (briug) has performed site characterization studies in the beishan area, china. so far, the beishan area has\\nbeen considered as the most potential candidate area for china's\\nhlw repository.\\n\\namong all the engineering properties of crystalline rocks at a\\npotential hlw repository site, the thermal conductivity is one of\\nthe most important parameters in design consideration because it\\nhas a direct impact on the evaluation of the necessary repository volume and the optimization of the repository layout (sundberg and\\nhellström, 2009). for instance, in the swedish kbs-3 concept for\\ngeological disposal of spent fuel, copper canisters with cast iron\\ninserts containing the spent fuel are surrounded by bentonite for isolation and mechanical protection (brantberger et al., 2006). the heat\\ngenerated by the spent fuel will increase the temperature of all components of the repository. for the bentonite buffer outside the canisters, the peak temperature must not exceed 100 °c. this requirement\\nimplies that the canisters cannot be deposited arbitrarily close to\\neach other. on the other hand, unnecessarily large distances\\nbetween the canisters will mean inefﬁcient and costly use of the\\nrepository rock volume (hökmark et al., 2009). to fulﬁll the temperature requirement, the rocks with low thermal conductivities will\\n\\n\\x0cx.g. zhao et al. / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137\\n\\n125\\n\\nlead to a larger distance between canisters than for a case with\\nhigh thermal conductivities. this is because the rocks with low\\nthermal conductivities will give rise to higher temperatures in the\\nbentonite (sundberg et al., 2008). hence, to design and construct\\nrepositories successfully, it is essential to perform an accurate assessment of the thermal conductivity characteristics of the host rock.\\nover the past few decades, various experimental approaches have\\nbeen employed to measure the thermal conductivity of rocks. the results indicate that the thermal conductivity of rocks is closely associated\\nwith mineral composition, porosity, texture, and density, etc. (birch and\\nclark, 1940; clauser and huenges, 1995; hartmann et al., 2005;\\nözkahraman et al., 2004; pasquale et al., 2015; ray et al., 2007;\\nsundberg et al., 2009). for crystalline rocks with relatively homogeneous texture and low porosity, the mineral composition dominates\\nthe thermal conductivity. in volcanic and sedimentary rocks, the high\\nvariability of porosity in these rocks is a major factor controlling the\\nthermal conductivity (clauser and huenges, 1995; özkahraman et al.,\\n2004). for example, increasing porosity, which acts as barrier to the\\nﬂow of heat, often results in both lower p-wave velocity and lower\\nthermal conductivity values (özkahraman et al., 2004). for a given\\nrock, water content and temperature have an inﬂuence on its thermal\\nconductivity. generally, the thermal conductivity of the rock increases\\nand decreases with increasing water content (cho and kwon, 2010;\\ncho et al., 2009) and temperature (abdulagatova et al., 2009; birch\\nand clark, 1940; heuze, 1983; miao et al., 2014; mottaghy et al., 2008;\\nvosteen and schellschmidt, 2003), respectively. moreover, the effect\\nof water saturation on the thermal conductivity of rocks shows a generally increasing trend with increasing porosity (nagaraju and roy, 2014).\\ngiven that the thermal conductivity of surrounding rocks around\\nthe excavations will be changed by the excavation-induced stress,\\nsome researchers studied the inﬂuence of pressure on the thermal\\nconductivity of rocks (abdulagatova et al., 2010; abdulagatova et al.,\\n2009; demırcı et al., 2004; görgülü et al., 2008; sibbitt, 1976; walsh\\nand decker, 1966; zimmerman, 1989). one of the main ﬁndings\\nachieved from these investigations shows that the thermal conductivity\\n\\nvaries with the pressure exerted on the rock. with increasing applied\\npressure, the thermal conductivity starts to increase and subsequently\\nthe increase rate tends to be a constant value due to gradual closure\\nof cracks and pores within the rock (görgülü et al., 2008; walsh and\\ndecker, 1966).\\n\\nwhile the above-mentioned studies provide meaningful insight into\\nthe thermal conductivity of various rocks, the thermal conductivity\\ncharacteristics of low-porosity crystalline rocks subjected to different\\nexternal factors such as water saturation, temperature and compression\\nstress have not been fully understood. on the other hand, the information on the thermal conductivity of rocks in a potential hlw repository\\nsite must be known with sufﬁcient conﬁdence to provide necessary\\ninput conditions for its long-term safety assessment, which is one of\\nthe motivations for this study. in this work, experimental investigations\\non the thermal conductivity of the beishan granitic rocks are conducted\\nusing the transient plane source (tps) method. in the following\\ndiscussion, rock sampling and basic physical properties of the rock\\nspecimens are introduced ﬁrst. testing facilities and procedures are\\nthen described. subsequently, the water saturation, temperature and\\ncompression stress dependent thermal conductivity characteristics of\\nthe tested rocks are evaluated comprehensively, and ﬁnally some\\ninsights are obtained.\\n\\n2. rock sampling and preparation\\n\\nthe beishan area is situated in gansu province of northwestern\\nchina (see fig. 1). after a long geological evolution and weathering\\nprocess, the topography of this area is characterized by a ﬂat gobi and\\nsmall gentle rolling hills with elevations ranging between 1400 and\\n2000 m above the sea level. the crust in this area possesses a blocky\\nstructure with many granite intrusions (see fig. 2). other surrounding\\nrocks include mainly metamorphic and sedimentary rocks, as well as\\nquaternary cover. rock sampling was carried out in the jijicao and\\nxinchang rock blocks, which are currently considered as two of the\\nkey investigation sub-areas during site selection and characterization.\\n\\nfig. 1. geographical location of the beishan area and a photo showing its typical topography.\\n\\n\\x0c126\\n\\nx.g. zhao et al. / tectonophysics 683 (2016)

approximately 63 mm were taken\\nfrom six sub-vertical boreholes (i.e., boreholes bs05, bs06, bs15, bs16,\\nbs18 and bs19) in these two sub-areas. the borehole locations are\\npresented in fig. 2.\\n\\nfield observations indicated that the collected granitic rocks\\nwere relatively isotropic in texture and mineralogical composition. to\\nevaluate the geological nature of the rocks, a series of thin sections\\nwere prepared and then exposed to cross-polarized light under an\\noptical microscope to identify the dominant minerals in the rocks. the\\npercentages of the dominant minerals were determined by point\\ncounting on thin sections. for each thin section approximately 500\\npoints covering phenocrysts and groundmass were counted. according\\nto the quartz-alkali feldspar-plagioclase (qap) diagram (streckeisen,\\n1976), the rocks can further be classiﬁed. it can be observed from\\nfig. 3 that the rocks contain mainly a moderate to low amount of quartz\\nand alkali feldspar, and a moderate to high amount of plagioclase. this\\nmeans that the collected rocks dominantly range from granodiorite to\\nmonzogranite. for grain size characteristics, the rocks are from ﬁne\\ngrained to, medium to coarse grained. an overview of the basic information of the rocks is listed in table 1. based on the borehole no. and\\nsampling depth, these rocks have been divided into eight groups.\\n\\na total of 47 pairs of rock specimens, 50 mm in diameter, were\\nprepared from the drill cores with a length to diameter ratio of approximately 0.5. in particular, specimen

the ﬁelds of geology and geophysics, laboratory approaches to\\nmeasuring soil and rock thermal conductivity can mainly be divided\\ninto two groups: steady state and transient state. in this work, the\\ntransient plane source (tps) method (gustafsson, 1991; log and\\ngustafsson, 1995) was utilized to measure the thermal conductivity of\\nthe specimens. as one of the transient measurement methods, the tps\\ntechnique is based on the use of a transiently heated plane sensor\\n(i.e., hot disk sensor) and a hot disk thermal constants analyser (see\\nfig. 4a). the used hot disk tps2500s system can measure thermal\\nconductivity of materials ranging from 0.01 to 400 w/mk. the hot\\ndisk sensor consists of a continuous double spiral, which is etched out\\nof a thin nickel foil (fig. 4e). this spiral is sandwiched between two\\nsheets of electrical insulation materials made of kapton. the sensor\\nacts both as a heat source for increasing the temperature of the specimens and as a dynamic temperature sensor for recording the temperature increase. during the measurement, the temperature in the sensor\\nrises and heat starts to ﬂow to the specimens. the temperature rise in\\nthe sensor provides an indicator of the thermal properties of the specimens. if the specimens have good thermal conducting properties, the\\nheat will be transported rapidly inside the specimens. on the contrary,\\nif the specimens have good thermal insulation properties, the sensor\\ntemperature will rise faster and the heat will not be transported\\nas much as in the test of the good thermal conducting specimens.\\ncompared with steady state measurement methods such as the divided\\nbar (beck and beck, 1958; birch, 1950; sass et al., 1971) and the guarded\\nhot plate (abdulagatova et al., 2009; alishaev et al., 2012), one of significant advantages of the tps technique is that the thermal conductivity of\\nmaterials can be measured more quickly, typically from several to tens\\nof seconds. hence, a long wait for thermal gradients to equilibrate is\\nnot required and the moisture migration in response to temperature\\ngradients was minimized (jackson and taylor, 1986). on the other\\nhand, unlike some transient methods such as thermal needle probes\\n(barry-macaulay et al., 2013; von herzen and maxwell, 1959), which\\nare commonly used for soils and soft rocks, the tps method can be\\n\\n\\x0cx.g. zhao et al. / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137\\n\\n127\\n\\ntable 1\\nbasic information and geological description of the tested rocks.\\n\\nrock type and

the thermal conductivity in a contact manner, which is different from non-contact optical scanning\\n\\nmeasurements (popov et al., 1999; popov et al., 2003). hence, the\\nthermal resistance between

tps method behaves, the\\nthermal conductivity equation can be solved assuming that the hot\\ndisk sensor consists of a certain number of concentric ring heat\\nsources located in an inﬁnitely large sample (hot disk, 2007). a constant electric power supplied to the sensor results in an increase in\\ntemperature which is directly related to the variation in the sensor\\nresistance (r(t)) by the equation:\\n\\n\\x10\\n\\n\\x11\\nr tð þ ¼ r0 1 þ αδt τð þ\\n\\nð1þ\\n\\nwhere r0 is the nickel electrical resistance in the beginning of the\\nrecording, α is the temperature coefﬁcient of resistance of the nickel\\nfoil, and δtðτþ is the mean value of temperature rise in the sensor due\\nto a constant current pulse given by:\\n\\n\\x10\\n\\nδt τð þ ¼ p0 π3=2ak\\n\\n\\x11−1d τð þ\\n\\nð2þ\\n\\nwhere p0 is the total output of power from the sensor, a is the sensor\\nradius, k is the thermal conductivity of the sample that is being\\ntested and d(τ) is a dimensionless time dependent function with:\\nτ ¼ t=θð\\nð3þ\\n\\nþ1=2; θ ¼ a2=d\\n\\nwhere t is the time measured from the start of the transient\\nrecording, θ is the characteristic time, which depends both on\\nparameters of the sensor and the sample, and d is the thermal\\ndiffusivity of the sample.\\n\\naccording to eq. (2), and δtðτþ and d(τ) plotted as a function of τ\\nprovides a linear relationship with a slope that is a function of p0, a,\\nand k. thermal conductivity k can be obtained by ﬁtting the experimental data to the straight line given by eq. (2); thermal diffusivity d is calculated from eq. (3) taking into account the τ value determined in the\\nprevious ﬁt.\\n\\nas mentioned above, the solution of the thermal conductivity\\nequation is based on the assumption that the hot disk sensor is located\\nin an inﬁnite material in perfect contact with the sensor surface.\\nthis means that the heat ﬂow generated from each measurement\\nmust not reach the outside boundaries of the specimen (hot disk,\\n2007). meanwhile, a careful preparation of specimen ends is required\\nto minimize thermal contact resistance. an estimation of how far the\\nheat ﬂow has proceeded in the specimen during a recording is the\\nprobing depth δp, which is deﬁned as (hot disk, 2007):\\n\\nﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ\\np\\ndt\\n\\nδp ¼ 2\\n\\nð4þ\\n\\nto determine the thermal conductivity with good accuracy, the\\nshortest distance from any part of the sensor to the nearest outside\\nboundary of the sample should be larger than δp. in our experiments,\\nthe used hot disk sensor has a radius of 6.403 mm. the shortest distance\\nis about 19 mm, and the probing depth is approximately 10 mm. for this\\nprobing depth value, we can consider that we are conducting a bulk\\nmeasurement.\\n\\n3.3. test

approximately constant under vacuum within\\n72 h (see fig. 5), indicating that the specimens were saturated with\\nwater. subsequently, the hot disk sensor was horizontally placed between the two saturated specimen pieces with the double spiral\\ncentered and totally covered, and the two specimen pieces were ﬁrmly\\nclamped together to ensure that there was no air gap between the\\nsensor and the specimen end surfaces, as presented in fig. 4d. in order\\nto remain water saturation, the saturated specimens and the sensor\\nwere kept in a plastic bag during thermal conductivity measurement\\n(adl-zarrabi, 2004). after the test, the used water-saturated specimens\\nwere suffered from dehydration treatment in a thermostatic drying\\noven at 105 °c for a period of 24 h and subsequently cooled in a\\ndesiccator to measure the thermal conductivity under a dry condition.\\nmeanwhile, the mass of the dry specimens (mdry) was measured, and\\nthe porosity (n) of the specimens was calculated using the equations\\n\\nn ¼ 100v p\\n\\nv %\\n\\nv p ¼ msat − mdry\\n\\nρw\\n\\nð5þ\\n\\nð6þ\\n\\nwhere v is the bulk rock volume, vp is the pore volume, and ρw is the\\ndensity of

temperature\\n\\nto investigate the effect of temperature on the thermal conductivity\\nof the tested rocks, measurements were performed on dry specimens\\nfrom 40 °c to 150 °c based on the requirements of the used test\\nequipment. compared with measurements at room temperature, the\\nexperiments under high temperature are time consuming due to a\\nslow stepwise heating process by using a constant temperature oil\\nbath and a temperature control system, as shown in fig. 4c. the thermal\\nconductivity measurement can only be conducted until the two specimen pieces in the chamber with a specimen holder within the oil bath\\nhave reached thermal equilibrium and kept a target temperature\\nvalue. during thermal equilibrium of the oil bath, the hot disk sensor\\nmonitors continuously

maintained constant for a period of about 15 min to avoid residual temperature drifts on the specimens. based on the in-situ stress\\nmeasurement results obtained from the beishan area (zhao et al.,\\n2013), the maximum axial compression stress applied to the\\nspecimens was set to be 45 mpa to approximately simulate the\\nexcavation-induced stress near the vertical hlw disposal element\\nboundary at a depth of 600 m. the axial stress applied to the specimens was recorded automatically, and the used stress path throughout the course of testing is presented in fig. 7. the experiments were\\nconducted at room temperature.\\n\\naccording to previous experimental results (zhao et al., 2015a; zhao\\net al., 2015b), the identiﬁed crack initiation stresses of cylindrical specimens of beishan granitic rocks under uniaxial compression using the\\ncumulative ae hit (caeh) method range from 45.3 to 109.1 mpa,\\nwhich are larger than the maximum compression stress adopted in\\nthe present study. hence, the stress-induced rock damage might not\\noccur in the tested specimens during loading. it should be mentioned\\nthat in the process of loading, the friction may occur at the interfaces\\nbetween the specimen ends and the sensor. due to limitation of the\\ntps measurement technique, the utilized test method does not consider\\nthe potential inﬂuence of interface

servo-controlled compression machine. for each\\ntest, two specimen pieces with the hot disk sensor were contained\\nbetween steel platens machined to match their end surfaces, as shown\\nin fig. 4b. the interfaces between the specimens and the steel\\nplatens were daubed with a thin layer of lubricant to reduce the\\nend effect of the platens during loading. when the experimental\\nsetup was

have a good consistency. for all\\nrock groups, the average thermal conductivity values in the dry state\\n(kdry) range between 2.412 and 2.812 w/mk. the values under watersaturated condition (ksat)

were added to this ﬁgure.\\nit is seen that the thermal conductivity of the specimens shows a\\ndecaying trend with increasing temperature, and the values at 150 °c\\nrange from 5.7% to 8.7% lower than those at room temperature. this\\nmeans that within the used temperature range, the inﬂuence of the\\nincreasing temperature on the decay of thermal conductivity for these\\nrocks is limited. on the other hand, a possible reason for the gradual\\ndecrease in thermal conductivity is the generation of thermally induced\\nmicrocracks in the rocks because of a mismatch between thermal\\nexpansion coefﬁcients of adjacent mineral grains in a homogeneous\\ntemperature ﬁeld (jansen et al., 1993), which has been demonstrated from a microcracking perspective based on numerical simulations\\n(zhao, 2016). based on the experimental data, the relationship\\nbetween thermal conductivity and temperature can be described\\nusing the equation:\\nk ¼ kr − at2\\n\\nð8þ\\n\\nwhere kr is the thermal conductivity of the rock at room temperature\\n(25 °c), t is the temperature in celsius, and a is the ﬁt coefﬁcient (see\\ntable 3). the parameter a affects the decaying velocity of the thermal\\nconductivity with the temperature, i.e., the decaying velocity of the\\nthermal conductivity increases as a increases. as shown in table 3,\\na in eq.

(2013), the abovementioned mixing models were used to predict the thermal conductivity values of the tested rocks in the water-saturated state. fig. 9 shows\\nthe comparison between measured and calculated thermal conductivities for the four different models. it can be observed from fig. 9a, b, and d\\nthat the geometric mean, the arithmetic mean, and the effectivemedium mean yield similar prediction results and consistently underestimate the thermal conductivity of the eight rock groups, especially for\\nthe groups with relatively high porosity values (e.g., groups bs05 and\\nbs15). the hashin–shtrikman mean shows a reasonably good ﬁt for\\nall rock groups, as shown in fig. 9c. the analysis results are basically in\\nline with observations reported by fuchs et al.

(11) reveals that the coefﬁcient b plays a critical role in controlling\\nthe increasing gradient of the thermal conductivity in the initial loading\\nstage (i.e., crack closure stage). the coefﬁcient c dominantly affects the\\nincreasing velocity of the thermal conductivity in the subsequent elastic\\ndeformation stage. based on experimental investigations on the thermal conductivity of some rocks subjected to uniaxial stresses using a\\nsteady-state apparatus developed by demırcı et al. (2004), görgülü\\net al. (2008) found that the parameters b and c depended on the magnitude of elastic modulus of the rocks, and subsequently established an\\nelastic modulus dependent model to predict the thermal conductivity\\nvalues under pressure. unfortunately, in the present study, the elastic\\nmoduli of the tested rocks have not been available. therefore, the\\nmodel proposed by görgülü et al. (2008) cannot be used to ﬁt our test\\nresults. according to fig. 14, we found that the increasing gradients of\\nthe thermal conductivities in the initial loading stage were generally\\nlarge for the rocks with a high porosity such as rock groups bs05 and\\nbs15. hence, the coefﬁcient b is associated with the rock porosity n,\\ni.e., b increases as n increases, as presented in fig. 15a. an

predictions and underestimated the thermal conductivity of the rocks under the water-saturated condition. future work\\nis demanded to verify the validity of various mixing models using different rock types with a large porosity range.\\n\\nwith increasing temperature from 25 °c to 150 °c, the thermal conductivity of the rocks shows a decaying trend and the values at 150 °c\\nrange from 5.7% to 8.7% lower than those at room temperature, revealing that the inﬂuence of temperature on the thermal conductivity of the\\ntested rocks is limited. in addition, the thermal conductivity of the rocks\\nincreases with increasing compression stress in a nonlinear behavior,\\nand the increase rate of the thermal conductivity increases with an increase of rock porosity. it is found that the effects of compression stress\\nand water saturation on the magnitude of thermal conductivity of the\\nrocks are basically comparable. based on the experimental data, the\\nempirical models considering the inﬂuence of rock porosity have been\\nestablished for predicting the temperature and compression stress\\ndependent thermal conductivity characteristics of the rocks, and the\\npredictions are found to be in good agreement with experimental results. this study thus emphasizes importance of porosity on thermal\\nconductivity measurements even for low porosity crystalline rocks.\\n\\nwhen the pores and cracks in the rocks tend to close during compression, quartz content may determine the thermal conductivity, and\\nthere exists an increase of the thermal conductivity with increasing\\nquartz content. this is because the closure of pores and cracks increases\\nthe contact opportunity of quartz grains, and hence improves the transportation capability of heat ﬂow in the rocks. while the test results provide insights into the thermal conductivity characteristics of beishan\\ngranitic rocks, one should be aware of the limitation of this study.\\nbecause the thermal conductivity of granitic rocks is inﬂuenced by\\nmany factors. in order to better understand the thermal conductivity\\nof granitic rocks related to rock characteristics such as rock fabric,\\ngrain shape, grain contact and grain size, comprehensive petrographic\\ninvestigations are recommended in the future. in the meantime, studies\\nshould be carried out to understand how the

geothermal ﬁeld mainly depends on\\nsubsurface ﬂuid ﬂow, which in active tectonic regions is\\ncontrolled by permeability of fault zones (moeck 2014). in\\nthat frame, the primary focus is on locating and characterizing faulted areas in geothermal ﬁelds. this study\\nemploys numerical modeling to allocate and quantify\\npermeability anisotropies and discontinuities, e.g., faults, in\\norder to understand their inﬂuence on subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow\\nin geothermal reservoirs.\\n\\nnumerical models have been increasingly used to\\nunderstand the setup and productivity of geothermal systems. a general overview of geothermal models has been\\ngiven by o’sullivan et al. (2001). additionally, there are\\nseveral sites exemplifying similar characteristics as in\\nlahendong. the underground movement of hot and cold\\nﬂuids has been modeled for geothermal ﬁelds in new\\nzealand (kaya et al. 2014). the kakkonda geothermal site,\\ne.g., consists of two reservoirs at various depths with different ﬂuid properties. there,\\nresults from ﬂuid ﬂow\\nanalysis show the

1995). generally, faults acting as\\npreferential ﬂuid path ways signiﬁcantly change the pressure and temperature ﬁeld in the reservoir (cherubini et al.\\n2013). models for the seferihisar–balc¸ova ﬁeld focus on\\nthe ﬂuid ﬂow inside of faults. results show an enhanced\\nupward heat transport through ﬂuids from bottom of the\\ngeothermal system (magri et al. 2011).\\n\\nour test ground is the lahendong geothermal ﬁeld\\nlocated in sulawesi, indonesia. the ﬁeld is owned and\\noperated by p.t. pertamina geothermal energy and hosts a\\npower plant with a production capacity of 80 mwe. there,\\ngeothermal exploration started in the early 1970s including\\ngeophysical and geohydrochemical approaches. it\\nis a\\nwater-dominated magmatic structurally controlled system.\\nfaults generally act as across-fault ﬂuid barriers and alongfault ﬂuid conductors (brehme et al. 2014). as a result, hot\\nsprings mainly appear on the top of vertically permeable\\nfaults at the surface. available numerous drilling and surface measurements allowed a detailed characterization of\\nthe geological and hydrogeological setting of the area\\n(fig. 1; brehme et al. 2011, 2013, 2014, 2016; wiegand\\net al. 2013). the model presented here is developed for\\ninvestigating subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow and the permeability\\ndistribution including the fault zones in the lahendong\\ngeothermal ﬁeld. below, the geological structure of the\\n\\nﬁeld is presented followed by an introduction to the modeling approach.\\n\\ndetailed investigation of subsurface permeability distribution is a crucial step for site selection and smart drilling strategies. the numerical simulations presented will\\nprovide insight into understanding the subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow\\nconsidering the hydraulic conductivity of faults. it ensures\\nproductive as well as sustainable operation of geothermal\\nﬁelds avoiding risks, such as drilling into non-fractured or\\ncold zones, and targeting highly corroding waters.\\nalthough the target area is lahendong, the general workﬂow is applicable for other geothermal sites consisting of\\nsimilar constraints.\\n\\nreservoir characterization\\n\\nhydrogeology\\n\\nthe overall driving force for the ﬂuid ﬂow is the sw–ne\\noriented natural hydraulic gradient\\nin the lahendong\\ngeothermal system. the direction of ﬂuid ﬂow varies\\nthrough the geothermal site due to horizontal partitioning\\nof the reservoir by relatively less permeable fault zones\\n(brehme et al. 2014). the basic sections are located in the\\n\\nfig.

to another, e.g., an acidic highly saline-type\\nbeneath lake linau and a neutral low saline-type south and\\neast of lake linau (fig. 1). the impermeable structure\\nacross faults prevent the ﬂuids from diluting each other\\n(brehme et al. 2016). however, faults are rather permeable\\nalong the vertical axis, which allows recharge of the system\\nthrough the faults. rainwater inﬁltrates at a fault in the sw,\\nat mt. lengkoan, and creek water inﬁltrates into the normal\\nfaults at lake linau (fig. 2). the hydrothermal system\\ndischarges into lake linau and toward the ne, as driven\\nby the hydraulic gradient (brehme et al. 2014).\\n\\nthe fracture network along the area is characterized by\\nstrike slip faults and normal faults. the sinistral faults\\nstrike n 40° and steeply dip toward the se. left step over\\non the strike slip faults forms an extension basin in the\\ncentral study area. normal faults at the extension basin\\nstrike nw and dip 70°–80° beneath lake linau (brehme\\net al. 2014).\\n\\nlithology\\n\\nlahendong area is mainly characterized by pre-, postand\\ntondano formation of plioto pleistocene age (koestono\\net al. 2010). the rocks are typically andesite, volcanic\\nbreccia, and tuff. those types have been sampled from\\nborehole cores and used to determine porosity, permeability, and thermal conductivity. effective porosity and matrix\\npermeability have been analyzed using a cylindrical-shaped\\n\\nspecimen with a dimension of 5 cm x 5 cm 9 2.5 cm oriented parallel to the coring (brehme et al. 2016). thermal\\nconductivity has been measured on plain sections of dried\\ncores. the experimental setup consists of a gas permeameter for determining matrix permeability (milsch et al.\\n2011), of an helium pycnometry for effective porosity\\nmeasurements (johnson-maynard et al. 1994) and of an\\noptical scanner for thermal conductivity measurements\\n(popov et al. 1999). these parameters have been measured\\nand averaged for the three rock types (brehme et al. 2016;\\ntable 1). andesite has an effective porosity of 3.7 %, a\\npermeability of 2.1 9 10-14 m2, and a thermal conductivity of 1.8 w m-1 k-1 (dry) or

porosity, and thermal conductivity and set according to laboratory measurements\\n(table 1). however, properties of the faults and lake\\nlinau are slightly adapted to speciﬁc conditions. the definitions for the modeled grids along the faults are as follows: porosity is 30 % and thermal conductivity is\\n1.8 w m-1 k-1. corresponding grids for lake linau are\\ndeﬁned by a porosity of 100 % and a thermal conductivity\\nof 0.6 w m-1 k-1. the model simulates ﬂuid ﬂow and\\nthermal transport in saturated media in steady state.\\n\\ninitial values and boundary conditions\\n\\nfluid ﬂow boundary conditions in the model describe\\ngroundwater heads and recharge amounts (table 2; fig. 2).\\nthe hydraulic head at the sw model boundary is 837 m\\nand 500 m at the ne boundary. the sw hydraulic head\\nrepresents inﬁltration of surface water into a fault, striking\\nperpendicular to the model. hydraulic head at the ne\\nborder is adapted to borehole measurements in that area\\n(brehme et al. 2014). inﬁltration into the fault zones at\\nlake linau is described by ﬂuid ﬂux boundary conditions.\\nthe quantity is 3.0 9 10-4 m s-1\\nthe sw and\\n1.3 9 10-6 m s-1 at the ne fault distributed over 40 m\\nfault width. groundwater recharge is set to 412 mm a-1 at\\nthe ne top surface (table 2; fig. 2). fluid movement in\\n\\nfor\\n\\n\\x0cthe model domain is constrained by

heat ﬂux is set\\nto\\n100 mw m-2 at\\nthe bottom model boundary (table 2;\\nfig. 2). this value is ﬁxed based on the studies from\\ndelisle et al.

and measured\\npressure and temperature (errors [45 %). adjustment of\\npermeability in geological\\ninﬁltration rates into\\nfaults, or hydraulic heads did not lead to acceptable results.\\nonly the implementation of strong permeability anisotropy\\nthroughout whole depth, i.e., an additional fault, resulted in\\nminimization of errors (0–7 %). implementation has been\\naccomplished by mesh

general, deﬁning a direction-dependent permeability\\nimproves the data ﬁt rather than using similar permeabilities in all directions. this is probably due to the fractures\\nincreasing the

recognized beneath lake linau, which has not been known\\nfrom former studies. simulated pressure and temperature\\nare measured at ﬁve selected observation points, which\\nrepresent boreholes with available bore logs for pressure\\nand temperature. details on data are given in fig. 6. the\\nmodel with best data ﬁt, out of 370 different models, is\\nconsidered to generate the ﬁnal model

and pressure data\\nin several wells. especially beneath lake linau, closely\\nlocated wells show high variations in temperature and\\npressure. a drop of 100 °c and 18 bar along 300 m distance has been observed between well lhd 24 and\\nlhd 28. models ﬁrst showed high discrepancies between\\nmodeled and measured values in this area. however, after\\nimplementing another high anisotropic permeable structure\\nbetween the observation points, models resulted in satisfactory results. the structure has ten times higher vertical\\n\\nenviron earth sci (2016) 75:1088\\n\\npermeability than horizontal permeability. this structure is\\nassumed to be another fault zone located between two\\nknown faults with vertical dip and nw strike. this fault\\nshows no trace at surface, because it is covered by lake\\nlinau.\\n\\ngenerally, modeled permeability distribution in the\\nlahendong reservoir is direction-dependent and overprints\\nthe lithology. modeled permeability is generally higher\\nthan measured ones in the order of up to four magnitudes.\\nthis is due to fracture patterns, which are not detectable at\\ncore-sample scale. permeability patterns directly affect\\nsubsurface ﬂuid ﬂow and temperature and pressure\\ndistribution.\\n\\npermeability in the faulted zones and surroundings is\\nlowest in the study area. especially the middle and ne\\nfault, the shallow area beneath sw lake linau and the\\ndeep ne section of the ne fault show low permeabilities\\nbetween 10-13 and 10-14 m2 (fig. 3). the area between\\nthe middle and ne fault, the deep

only within the modeled area,\\nbut also in vertical and horizontal direction. in faults and\\nthe deep reservoir section in the ne, permeability is by a\\nfactor of 10 higher in the vertical

in the reservoir rocks. isotherms generally follow the sw–ne oriented ﬂow pattern, the rise and\\nthe inﬁltration of ﬂuids. upwelling of isotherms between\\nthe faults veriﬁes water rise toward lake linau. inﬁltration\\nof cold water causes down welling of isotherms particularly on the northeast section of the model. temperature is\\nlocally increased at the bottom of the model surrounding\\nthe pluton (fig. 4).\\n\\nsubsurface ﬂuid ﬂow\\n\\nthe absolute and horizontal/vertical permeability distribution controls local ﬂuid ﬂow in the lahendong reservoir.\\n\\nthe general ﬂuid ﬂow, driven by the natural pressure\\ngradient, is oriented from sw to ne. vertical inﬁltration\\noccurs at faults at lake linau and at the sw boundary.\\ndischarge is across the ne model boundary (fig. 5). the\\nmore detailed ﬂow patterns can be observed with streamlines, which show a ﬂuid ﬂow along highly permeable\\nareas. calculated streamlines describe particle ﬂow within\\nthe model domain. a forward calculation shows how\\ninﬁltrating water at the sw model boundary distributes\\nthrough the reservoir. the backward calculation shows the\\nsource of ﬂuid particles arriving at the ne model boundary\\n(fig. 5). patterns show that hot groundwater ﬂows toward\\nthe faults beneath lake linau, where the ﬂuid ﬂow is\\ndisturbed by a rise in temperature and vertically high permeable layers. this causes a rise of groundwater in this\\nmodel area (red forward streamlines in fig. 5). at the same\\ntime, cold water inﬁltrates into high permeable areas and\\ndistributes over the ne model domain (blue backward\\nstreamlines in fig. 5). it is clearly seen that the composition of the ne reservoir domain is dominated by coldwater\\ninﬁltration into faults, while the production areas are\\ncharacterized by hot water ﬂow (fig. 5).\\n\\ndiscussion\\n\\ninvestigation of\\nsubsurface ﬂuid ﬂow in geothermal\\nreservoirs is crucial for sustainable exploitation avoiding\\ndrilling into

hydraulic–thermal\\nsimulations. simulation results show the detailed permeability distribution in the reservoir including location of an\\nadditional fault zone.\\n\\nmatching of measured and simulated temperature and\\npressure has been used as a tool for resolving the permeability distribution. temperature and pressure have been\\niteratively determined at\\nseveral observation points\\n(fig. 2). generally, modeled values are in good agreement\\nwith observed ones (fig. 6). nevertheless, some observation points give slightly different values for both pressure\\nand temperature (lhd 4 and lhd 7) or only temperature\\n(lhd 24). this is probably due to the complicated ﬂow\\nprocesses or strong small-scale structural variation in\\nfractured and faulted areas. furthermore, density variations, which could have not been included into simulation\\ndue to high temperatures, could cause variation of ﬂuid\\npressure. however,\\nthe average deviation of simulated\\npressure and temperature is 1 %.\\n\\nimplemented model parameters are porosity, permeability, and heat conductivity. from those parameters, only\\npermeability has been tested in a speciﬁc range during\\nsimulation. the inﬂuence of porosity and heat conductivity\\non ﬂuid ﬂow is negligible due to dominating convective\\nheat ﬂow (ondrak et al. 1998). values implemented in the\\nmodel are based on measured permeabilities, which represent matrix permeability of rocks.\\n\\nthe measured matrix permeability, representing permeability in horizontal direction, is 1.5 9 10-14 m2 on\\n\\n123\\n\\naverage, which remains within typical permeability range\\nfor fractured igneous rocks (scho¨n 2004). permeability for\\nvolcanic breccias ranges typically between 3 9 10-15

fracture formation. it might also be\\ndecreased due to alteration and sealing in faults.\\nin\\nlahendong, modeled permeability can be up to four magnitudes higher than measured ones in faulted areas. this is\\ncaused by fractures, which are not detectable in core scale.\\nmoreover, in fault cores, it is by a factor of 10 higher in\\nvertical direction than in horizontal direction. however, in\\nareas between faults (fault gauge), permeability is in some\\nparts by a factor of 10–100 lower in the vertical direction.\\nadaptation of permeability ensures a ﬁt to measured temperature and

(2014)\\n\\ntemperature drops and upwelling of isotherms indicate that\\nfault zones control the ﬂuid ﬂow in the lake long and\\nvalentine ﬁelds, usa (hooper 1991). the analysis of ﬂuid\\npressure differences at\\nthe alpine fault, new zealand,\\nallowed to characterize the change in permeability between\\nhanging and footwall blocks (sutherland et al. 2012).\\n\\nin summary, high pressure or temperature gradients are\\nindicators for ﬂuid barriers between observation points. in\\nother words, reservoir sections of different properties are\\nseparated by horizontally less permeable faults. in lahendong, most signiﬁcant ﬂuid barriers are faults to the sw\\nand to the ne of lake linau. across these barriers, the\\npressure drops up to 20 bars. a similar pattern has been\\nmeasured in bore logs beneath lake linau, where no surface trace of a fault had been observed in former studies.\\nhowever, only by implementing another fault, modeled\\nand measured values could have been adapted. the\\nrecently identiﬁed fault zone beneath lake linau remains\\nunder lake water and therefore is only traceable by this\\nkind of reservoir modeling.\\n\\nadditionally to fault identiﬁcation, the internal structure\\nof known fault zones has been understood in detail. the ne\\nfault,\\ni.e., shows a displacement at 2 km depth. the\\ndetailed trend has been understood by permeability adaptation in this area.\\n\\ndue to low permeability in horizontal direction in the\\nfaults, ﬂuids propagate mostly vertically toward the hot\\nsprings at surface. it also allows surface water to inﬁltrate\\ninto the reservoir in case the pressure within the fault zone\\nis low enough (fig. 5). this vertical ﬂuid movement\\n\\neventually controls the temperature distribution in the\\nreservoir. upward migration of deep hot water increases\\nthe temperature, while inﬁltration of cold surface water\\ncauses local drop of temperature.\\n\\nin summary, the most important factors inﬂuencing the\\nreliability of numerical reservoir models are absolute and\\ndifferent horizontal and vertical permeability. however, a\\npermeability adaptation has been done for each geological\\nlayer; the vertical permeability anomalies are overprinting\\nthose layers and are constraining the regional groundwater\\nﬂow. those permeabilities of fractures directly inﬂuence\\nthe productivity of the reservoir (cherubini et al. 2013).\\ntherefore,\\ntheir permeability characteristics should be\\ninvestigated in detail.\\n\\nin a previous study, a numerical model for the

bars. however, the forecast results are\\nuncertain due to lack of measured pressure draw down data\\n(yani 2006). accordingly, the next steps of the presented\\nstudy should include a realistic

identiﬁed\\nbeneath lake linau. temperature and pressure signiﬁcantly drop across that ﬂuid barrier. this behavior has been\\nobserved in comparable ﬁelds in the usa as well. the\\noverall shape of ﬂuid ﬂow direction trends in a sw–ne\\ndirection. main recharge occurs by inﬁltration of surface\\nwater into the faults, especially in the southwest and near to\\nlake linau. discharge is enhanced in

due   to  severe   environmental   impacts   created   by   conventional   fossil   usage   on  global   climatic   change.   however,   its  wide\\napplication   has   been   limited   due   to   the   lack   of   knowledge,   particularly   of   the   geothermal   conditions   of\\nreservoir   rocks   at   elevated   temperatures   and   pressures.   such   high   temperatures   and   pressures   possibly\\nalter   the  mechanical   properties   of  reservoir   rocks   due   to   the   associated   micro-structural   and   mineralogical  alterations   of   the   rock   mass,   which   are   an   important   attribute   for   wellbore   stability   and   stimulation   of\\ngeothermal   reservoirs   for   safe  and   effective   geothermal   energy   extraction.   this   study   therefore   investigates   the   stress-strain   behaviour   under   in-situ   stress   and   temperature   conditions   by   conducting   a  series\\nof  high-pressure,   high-temperature   tri-axial   experiments   on  australian   strathbogie   granite   under   four\\ndifferent  conﬁning   pressures   (10,   30,   60,   90   mpa)   and   four   different   temperatures   (rt,   100,   200,   300 ◦c).\\nthe  effect   of  temperature   on   the   mechanical   behaviour   of   rock   specimens   was   studied   under   tri-axial   conditions   and   the   corresponding   fracture   propagation   behaviour   was   observed   using   an   advanced   acoustic\\nemission   (ae)   system.   the   corresponding   micro-structure   alteration   in   granite   was   observed   using   sem\\nanalysis.   according   to   the   ﬁndings,   increasing   temperature   leads   to  an   initial   increment   in   reservoir\\nrock   strength   and   shear   parameters   followed   by   reduction,   and   the   trend   is   aligned   with   the   crack  formation   pattern   of   the  rock   mass.   this   was   further   conﬁrmed   by   the   sem   analysis,   according   to  which\\nthe   rock   micro-structure   is   subject   to  only   minor   changes   at   relatively   low   temperatures   and  higher\\ntemperatures   cause   micro-cracks   to   develop   along   the   rock   mass   grain   boundaries.   furthermore,   the\\nconventional   mohr-coulomb   criteria   failed   to   model   the  stress-strain   response   of   rock   under   geothermal\\nreservoir   conditions,   and   was   therefore   modiﬁed   for   the   corresponding   in-situ   conditions.\\n\\n©   2016   elsevier   ltd.   all   rights   reserved.\\n\\n1.  introduction\\n\\ngeothermal  heat  has  been

reservoirs  have  been  found  to  have  adequate  temperatures  to  serve  as  a\\ngeothermal  reservoirs  (fox  et  al.,  2013).  such  explorations  involve\\nﬁnding  vast  blocks  of  “hot  rocks”  with  fracture  systems.  such  rocks\\ncan  be  used  to  generate  electricity.  in  this  process,  water  is  ﬁrst\\ninjected  and  circulated  through  the  fractures  in  the  geothermal\\nreservoirs  and  eventually  pumped  back  to  the  surface  as  steam.\\nhowever,  the  exploration  of  geothermal  resources  has  become  a\\nchallenge  to  engineers  and  geologists,  due  to  the  high  temperature\\nand  stress  environments  in  geothermal  reservoirs.  for  this  reason,\\nlaboratory  experiments  conducted  under  high  pressure  and  temperature  conditions  (geothermal  conditions)  can  assist  in  providing\\n\\n\\x0cw.g.p.  kumari  et  al.  /  geothermics  65  (2017)  44–59 \\n\\n45\\n\\nbasic  predictions.  a  large  number  of  laboratory  experiments  has\\ntherefore  been  conducted  since  1970  to  investigate  the  inﬂuence\\nof  high  pressure  and  temperature  on  rock  in  relation  to  geothermal\\nheat  extraction  (siratovich  et  al.,  2016),  deep  geological  disposal  of\\nnuclear  waste  (paquet  and  franc¸  ois,  1980),  deep  mining  (wawersik\\nand  hannum,  1980)  and  geological  co2 storage  (dai  et  al.,  2014).\\nthe  mechanical  behaviour  of  reservoir  rocks  is  signiﬁcantly\\ninﬂuenced  by  elevated  temperatures,  because  they  cause  the\\nmicro-structure  of  the  rock  mass  to  be  altered  through  thermal   expansion,  the  development  of  new  micro-cracks,  extending\\nand/or  widening  the  existing  micro cracks  and  various  mineralogical  alterations.  rock  strength-deformation  criteria  change\\nwith  temperature,  and  some  rock  mechanical  properties,  such  as\\ncompressive  strength,  tensile  strength,  elastic  modulus,  cohesive\\nstrength  and  friction  angle,  decrease  with  increasing  temperature\\n(heuze,  1983;  dwivedi  et  al.,  2008).  however,  such  alterations  are\\nalso  affected  by  the  conﬁnement  applying  on  the  rock  mass,  and\\nconﬁning  pressure  causes  the  suppression  of  thermal  cracks  and\\nthe  extension/widening  of  existing  micro-cracks.  this  results  in\\nfurther  alteration  of  the  rock  mass  mechanical  properties,  resulting  in  changing  failure  modes  (mogi,  1966).  studies  have  identiﬁed\\nthe  transition  of  rock  failure  mode  from  brittle  to  ductile  with\\nincreasing  conﬁnement.  however,  this  transition  is  diverse  due  to\\nthe  different  mineralogical  compositions  and  grain  boundaries  in\\ndifferent  rocks  (klein  et  al.,  2001;  wong,  1982).\\n\\nalthough  many  studies  have  been  conducted  to  investigate  the\\ntemperature-dependent  mechanical  behaviour  of  reservoir  rocks,\\nmost  experiments  have  been  conducted  in  unconﬁned  environments  (singh  et  al.,  2015;  shao  et  al.,  2014).  pre-heating  the\\nspecimens  to  the  corresponding  temperature  ranges  and  testing  at  room  temperatures  has  been  frequently  done  (bauer  and\\njohnson,  1979;  xu  et  al.,  2008),  but  the  method  is  not  reliable,\\nas  geothermal  reservoirs  experience  continuous  thermal  stresses.\\nsuch  limitations  have  occurred  mainly  due  to  the  limited  number  of\\nappropriate  test  facilities  available  to  simulate  the  stress  and  temperature  conditions  of  actual  geothermal  reservoirs.  although  some\\nstudies  have  analytically  and  numerically  evaluated  the  mechanical\\nproperties  of  rocks  under  high  temperatures  and  pressures  (chester\\nand  higgs,  1992;  tian  et  al.,  2013;  vásárhelyi  et  al.,  2016),  to  date\\nnone  has  captured  the  stress-strain  behaviour  and  failure  criteria  of\\nrocks  over  a  wide  range  of  conﬁning  pressures  and  temperatures,\\nparticularly  for  australian  granite.  however,  the  thermo-elastic\\nresponse  and  appropriate  failure  criteria  are  essential  inputs  for\\nmany  engineering  applications  under  high  pressures  and  temperatures,  including  geothermal  extraction  applications.  this  study\\ntherefore  intends  to  ﬁll  this  gap,  and  it  is  hoped  it  will  make  an\\nimportant  contribution  to  many  deep  underground  applications.\\n\\n2.  methodology\\n\\n2.1.  tested  material\\n\\ngranite  is  an  abundant  crystalline  rock  in  the  earth  with  medium\\nto  coarse  grains  which  was  formed  as  a  result  of  the  slow  cooling\\nof  magma.  granite  therefore  has  abundant  radioactive  elements\\n(k,  th,  and  u).  such  elements  bring  elevated  geothermal  gradients\\nto  deep  granite  reservoirs,  which  therefore  have  ideal  conditions\\nas  geothermal  reservoirs.  the  mineralogical  composition  of  granite  mainly  consists  of  quartz,  feldspar,  plagioclase  and  biotite,  and\\nsmall  amounts  of  muscovite,  amphibole,  hornblende  and  opaque\\n(dwivedi  et  al.,  2008).\\n\\nfor  the  present  study,

mercury  intrusion  testing  (porosity)  and  volume  and\\nweight  measurement  (bulk  density).\\n\\n2.2.  sample  preparation\\n\\nsample  preparation  and  testing  were  carried  out  at  the  deep\\nearth  energy  research  laboratory  (deerl)  in  the  civil  engineering  department  of  monash  university,  and  the  sample  preparation\\nwas  conducted  in  accordance  with  the  astm  standard  for  tri-axial\\ncompressive  testing  (astm  d7012-10  (2010)).  in  order  to  maintain\\nconsistency,  all  the  samples  were  cored  to  22.5  mm  in  diameter\\nusing  the  same  block  of  granite  at  the  same  orientation.  during  the\\nsampling  great  care  was  taken  to  obtain  samples  with  the  same\\ncrystalline  orientation,  and  samples  with  different  crystalline  orientation,  internal  layers  and  visible  cracks  were  discarded.  it  should\\nbe  noted  that  coring-induced  rock-microstructure  alteration  is  an\\nimportant  aspect  to  consider  in  laboratory  experiments,  although\\nfew  studies  have  considered  this  effect.  to  avoid  such  issues,  a  very\\nsmall  coring  rate  was  adopted  and  water  was  used  as  a  lubricant.\\nthe  cored  specimens  were  then  cut  into  45  mm  high  cylinders  and\\nboth  ends  of  the  specimens  were  ground  to  produce  two  parallel\\nsurfaces  perpendicular  to  the  axes  of  the  cylindrical  specimens.\\n\\n2.3.  experimental  procedure\\n\\ntri-axial  experiments  were  conducted  on  samples  under  four\\ndifferent  conﬁning  pressures  (10,  30,  60  and  90  mpa)  and  four\\ndifferent  temperatures  (rt,  100,  200,  300 ◦c).  these  experimental  conditions  were  selected,  because  the  most  preferable  hot  dry\\nrock  systems  are  generally  located  at  depths  of  2.5–3.5  km  and\\nhave  around  70  mpa–120  mpa   conﬁning  pressures  (assuming  the\\nreservoir  rock  density  is  equal  to  2500  kg/m3)  and  temperatures  of\\n\\n200–350 ◦c  (breede  et  al.,  2013).  the  different  conﬁning  pressures\\nand  temperatures  were  selected  to  simulate  the  reservoir  depth\\neffect  and  to  obtain  a  sufﬁcient  data  set  to  understand  the  failure\\ncriteria  under  different  temperatures.\\n\\nthe  complete  arrangement  of  the  tri-axial  cell  is  shown  in\\nfig.  3.  the  prepared  sample  was  ﬁrst  placed  inside  the  cell  and  the\\nrequired  conﬁning  pressure  was   then  applied  using  a  silicon  oil  system,  and  an  annealed  copper  sleeve  was  used  to  isolate  the  sample\\nfrom  the  conﬁning  liquid  (refer  to  fig.  3(b).  a  mica-insulated  metal\\nband  heater  was   used  to  heat  the  pressure  cell  and  consequently\\nthe  rock  sample.  the  temperatures  of  the  cell  were  adjusted  using  a\\ncontroller  and  a  constant  small  heating  rate  of  2.5 ◦c/min  was  used\\nto  prevent  micro-structural  damage  due  to  sudden  thermal  shocks.\\ntwo  separate  thermocouples  were  used  to  achieve  precise  temperature  control,  and  the  reading  of  the  thermocouple  installed  inside\\nthe  cell  (fig.  3(b))  was   recorded  by  the  data  acquisition  system.  the\\nother  thermocouple  that  was   attached  to  the  barrel  (fig.  3(a))  was\\nused  to  control  the  band  heater.  furthermore,  the  barrel  and  the\\ntop  of  the  pressure  cell  were  covered  using  an  insulating  blanket\\nto  reduce  heat  loss  during  the  experiments  and  to  minimise  the\\ninﬂuence  of  air  ﬂows  towards  the  cell.  all  the  tests  were  started\\nonce  the  system  had  achieved  a  steady  state  to  ensure  uniformity\\nin  temperature  and  pressure  across  the  sample.  equilibrium  was\\nensured  by  monitoring  the  conﬁnement  pump  volume  and  the\\nthermocouple  readings  inside  the  cell  (located  very  close  to  the\\nspecimen).  under  steady-state  conditions,  constant  pump  volume\\nand  constant  temperature  were  observed  and  testing  was   initiated.\\na\\n  constant  loading  pump  ﬂow  rate  of  1  ml/min  was  adopted  for\\nall  the  test  specimens  and  the  converted  displacement  rate  was\\n0.05  mm/min.  it  should  be  noted  that  a  small  shaft  resistance  exists\\nas  a  result  of  the  sealing  of  the  hydraulic  cylinder,  and  this  effect\\nwas  considered  in  the  calibration  of  the  loading  cell.  the  sealing\\nresistance  was  obtained  by  measuring  the  pump  pressure  to  initiate  a  movement  in  the  loading  shaft,  and  this  was   deducted  from\\neach  pressure  reading  to  eliminate  the  resistance  of  the  sealing  dur\\x0cw.g.p.  kumari  et  al.  /  geothermics  65  (2017)  44–59 \\n\\n47\\n\\nusing  the  typical  mohr-coulomb  brittle  deformation.  the  deviatoric\\nstress-strain  plots  of  the  granite  samples  (fig.  4)  exhibited  concave\\nupward  curvilinear  trends  from  initial  loading  to  the  peak  value,\\nbeyond  which  strain  softening  occurred,  causing  a  rapid  stress  drop\\nto  a  residual  value.  increasing  peak  stress  with  increasing  conﬁning  pressure  can  be  observed,  which  is  to  be  expected,  according\\nto  typical  mohr-coulomb  type  brittle  failure  (paterson  and  wong,\\n2005).\\n\\ntraditionally,  rock  failure  in  compression  can  occur  in  two\\nmain  ways;  (a)  dilatancy  and  failure  by  strain  softening  under\\nrelatively  low  conﬁning  pressures  and  (b)  failure  by  strain  hardening  under  elevated  conﬁning  pressures,  and  a  transitional  regime\\nmay   be  observed  at  intermediate  pressures.  these  transitional  failure  modes  have  been  referred  to  as  “quasi-brittle”,  and  complex\\nlocalized  features  such  as  conjugate  shear  bands  can  be  observed\\nunder  such  conditions  (klein  et  al.,  2001;  gajo  et  al.,  2004).  by\\nvisual  inspection  of  the  post-failure  samples,  important  information  about  the  alteration  of  the  granite  failure  mechanism  with\\nconﬁning  pressures  and  temperatures  can  be  identiﬁed.  postfailure  images  (fig.  5)  were  therefore  collected  after  each  test.\\n\\naccording  to  the  post-failure  images,  specimens  that  failed\\nat  10–60  mpa   conﬁning  pressures  mainly  failed  by  shear  localization  along  an  inclined  macroscopic  shear  band  with  a  single\\nshear  zone  across  each  sample.  however,  samples  tested  at  higher\\nconﬁnements  of  90  mpa   and  120  mpa   (at  100 ◦c)  exhibited  strain\\nhardening  characteristics  after  achieving  the  peak  stress,  and  several  conjugate  shear  bands  could  be  observed  on  the  cylindrical\\nsample  surface,  instead  of  the  single  shear  band  observed  earlier.\\nthis  characteristic  was  signiﬁcant  at  120  mpa   conﬁning  pressure.\\nhowever,  it  should  be  noted  that  only  one  test  was   conducted\\nat  120  mpa   conﬁnement,  because  at  such  high  conﬁning  pressures  the  corresponding  failure  load  of  granite  exceeds  the  bottom\\npedestal’s  load-bearing  capacity.  further,  a  progressive  reduction\\nwas  observed  in  the  failure  plane  angle  with  respect  to  the  minor\\nprincipal  stress  direction  with  increasing  conﬁning  pressure,  which\\nimplies  a  reduction  in  friction  angle,  possibly  due  to  the  greater\\nquasi-brittle  behaviour  that  was   shown  by  granite  samples  at\\nhigher  conﬁning  pressures  (wong  et  al.,  2001).\\n\\n3.2.  effect  of  temperature  and  conﬁning  pressure  on  mechanical\\nproperties  of  strathbogie  granite\\n\\nfig.  6  illustrates  the  inﬂuence  of  temperature  on  the  deviatoric\\nstress  of  the  tested  granite  under  each  conﬁnement.  as  the  ﬁgure  shows,  the  inﬂuence  of  conﬁnement  is  more  signiﬁcant  than\\nthat  of  temperature  in  the  temperature  range  considered  here.\\nwong  and  brace  (1979)  conﬁrm  that  at  lower  conﬁning  pressures\\nconsiderable  thermal  cracking  occurs  at  relatively  low  temperatures.  if  thermal  cracking  is  responsible  for  the  reduction  in  failure\\nstrength,  a  sharp  reduction  in  deviatoric  stress  with  increasing\\ntemperature  (with  suppression  of  thermal  cracks)  should  be  exhibited  under  unconﬁned  pressure  condition.  however,  based  on  the\\nexperimental  results,  under  unconﬁned  conditions,  up  to  100 ◦c,\\n17.6%  of  increment  in  deviatoric  stress  is  followed  by  2.5%  and\\n10.5%  reductions  at  200 ◦c  and  300 ◦c,  respectively.  however,  when\\nconﬁnement  was  applied,  strength  reduction  was  initiated  after\\n  higher  temperature  of  200 ◦c,  mainly  due  to  the  inhibition  of\\na\\nthermal  cracks  by  induced  compressive  force.  thermal  cracking  is\\ntherefore  an  important  strength  property  alteration  mechanism

increasing  the  temperature  from  room  temperature  to  200 ◦c  causes  an  increment  in\\ndeviatoric  stress,  and  further  increasing  of  temperature  to  300 ◦c\\ncauses  a  slight  reduction  in  it.  this  is  because  the  thermal  expansion\\nwhich  occurs  with  increasing  temperature  causes  the  reduction  of\\n\\nfig.  3.

 reductions  of  strength  characteristics  were\\nrelatively  small  up  to  500 ◦c  and  beyond  that  an  accelerated  downward  trend  was  identiﬁed.  furthermore,  wider  localized  zones\\nwere  observed  at  high  temperatures  in  the  post-failure  images.\\nhowever,  these  studies  were  conducted  at  wider  temperature\\nranges  (up  to  700 ◦c  and  900 ◦c,  respectively)  and  the  researchers\\ntherefore  did  not  pay  close  attention  to  reservoir  rock  behaviour\\nunder  relatively  low  geothermal  temperature  ranges  (<300 ◦c).  this\\nwas  the  focus  of  the  present  study,  according  to  which  there  is\\nan  initial  strengthening  and  stiffening  in  granite  with  increasing\\ntemperature  at  low  temperatures  (up  to  200 ◦c),  and  increasing\\nthe  temperature  beyond  a  certain  value  causes  a  gradual  reduction  in  failure  stress  with  increasing  temperature.  elastic  modulus\\nis  an  important  mechanical  property  of  any  reservoir  rock,  and\\n\\ndescribes  the  brittle  characteristics  of  the  rock  mass.  it  is  therefore\\noften  used  to  evaluate  many  in-situ  stress  applications,  including\\nwellbore  stability,  fracturing  possibility  and  tectonic  stress  distribution  (heard  and  page,  1982).  the  temperature-dependent  brittle\\nproperties  (elastic  modulus)  of  the  tested  granite  were  then  evaluated.  the  elastic  region  of  each  stress-strain  curve  was  used  to\\ncalculate  the  temperature and  pressure-dependent  young’s  moduli  (e)  and  the  results  are  shown  in  fig.  7.  the  axial  strain  was\\nmeasured  using  lvdts  attached  to  the  loading  ram  with  a  linearity\\n±0.1%  f.s  (full  scale)  (±0.0075  mm)   and  inﬁnite  resoluerror  of \\ntion  (no  hysteresis).  an  increment  of  the  modulus  of  strathbogie\\ngranite  with  increasing  temperature  up  to  200 ◦c  can  be  observed,\\nand  further  increase  of  temperature  (to  300 ◦c)  causes  the  elastic\\nmodulus  to  be  slightly  reduced  for  any  conﬁnement.  this  trend  is\\n\\n\\x0ca\\n\\n‘brittle’  or \\n\\n  general  increment  in  elastic  modulus  with  increasing  conﬁnement  can  be  observed  until  90  mpa,  and  a  further  increase\\nof  conﬁnement  (to  120  mpa)  reduces  the  young’s  modulus  considerably.  with \\nincreasing  conﬁning  stress  additional  plastic\\ndeformation  occurs,  exhibiting  strain-hardening  characteristics  in\\ngranite  under  high  conﬁnements.  however,  within  the  range  of\\nthe  experiments  conducted  (10  mpa–120  mpa)  it  cannot  be  deﬁnitively  identiﬁed  as  a \\n’ductile’  regime.  however,  the\\nstrain-hardening  behaviour  observed  at  120  mpa   indicates  transitional  characteristics  and  this  can  be  identiﬁed  as  ‘quasi-brittle’\\nbehaviour  (klein  et  al.,  2001).  the  initial  young’s  modulus  reduction  with  increasing  conﬁnement  was  observed  by  heard  and  page\\n(1982),  who   conducted  tests  up  to  55  mpa   conﬁning  pressure.  however,  the  latter  behaviour  was  not  observed  by  these  researchers.\\ninterestingly,  according  to  the  research  literature,  at  low  temperatures  (<200 ◦c)  some  granite  types  are  more  temperature-sensitive,\\nwhile  in  contrast,  some  granites  are  more  temperature-sensitive\\nat  high  temperatures.  the  initial  strength  enhancement  is  more\\nsigniﬁcant  for  coarse-grained  granites  and  granodiorite  than  for\\nﬁne-grained  granites.  for  example,  according  to  heard  and  page\\n(1982),  stripa  granite  is  more  sensitive  to  temperature  at  relatively  low  temperatures  (<200 ◦c),  and  westerly  granite  is  more\\nsensitive  to  temperature  at  high  temperatures  (>200 ◦c).  such  contradictory  behaviours  may   occur  in  granite  due  to  the  different\\ngrain  size  distributions,  grain  orientations,  mineralogical  compositions  and  heterogeneity  of  different  granite  types.  this  indicates  the\\nimportance  of  studying  the  mineralogical  composition  and  microstructural  inﬂuence  of  granites  on  such  on  temperature-dependent\\nstrength  variations.\\n\\n3.3.  effect  of  temperature  on  shear  strength  parameters  of\\nstrathbogie  granite\\n\\nfig.  8  illustrates  the  variation  of  deviatoric  stress  of  the  tested\\ngranite  with  conﬁning  pressure  for  each  temperature.  the  ﬁgure\\nshows  that  increasing  conﬁnement  causes  the  granite’s  deviatoric\\nstress  to  increase  non-linearly  and  gradually  come  to  a  steady  state.\\nthis  is  consistent  with  similar  previous  studies,  which  have  clearly\\nshown  the  enhancement  of  rock  strength  with  increasing  conﬁnement,  and  the  increasing  rate  is  reduced  with  increasing  conﬁning\\npressure  (barton,  2013;  singh  et  al.,  2011).  this  is  because  at  low\\nconﬁning  pressures  there  is  a  high  dilation  potential.  therefore,  the\\nability  to  open  rock  micro-cracks  is  high,  resulting  in  higher  friction  angles.  however,  this  dilation  potential  and  the  corresponding\\ntendency  for  micro-cracks  to  open  are  suppressed  with  increasing\\nconﬁnement,  resulting  in  lower  friction  angles  at  higher  conﬁning  pressures.  therefore,  the  failure  mechanism  of  the  rocks  shifts\\nfrom  brittle  to  ductile  with  increasing  conﬁnement,  changing  the\\nshape  of  the  mohr-coulomb  failure  envelope,  and  according  to\\nbarton  (1976),  at  critical  conﬁning  pressure  the  mohr-coulomb  failure  envelope  reaches  a  zero  gradient.  this  has  also  been  shown\\nby  hoek  (1983).  the  present  study  has  clearly  identiﬁed  this  rock\\nbehaviour  in  the  mohr-coulomb  failure  envelopes  developed  for\\neach  temperature  condition  (refer  to  fig.  9).  according  to  fig.  9,\\nthe  traditional  linear  mohr-coulomb  criteria  are  applicable  only  in\\nthe  brittle  region  of  the  failure  envelope,  and  at  higher  conﬁnew.g.p.  kumari  et  al.  /  geothermics  65  (2017)  44–59\\n\\nconsistent  with  the  temperature-dependent  strength  behaviour  of\\nthe  granite  described  above.  the  reason  for  the  initial  elastic  module  increment  may  be  that  the  specimen  becomes  more  brittle  at\\nthe  initial  temperature  ranges  due  to  thermally-induced  volumetric  expansion  and  the  associated  pore  volume  reduction.  the  later\\nslight  reduction  of  young’s  modulus  with  increasing  temperature\\nexhibits  an  enhancement  in  ductile  behaviour  (quasi-brittle  characteristics)  with  further  increase  of  temperature.  this  is  possibly\\ndue  to  the  increased  crack  density  caused  by  the  induced  thermal\\ncrack  development  and  the  related  weakening  of  the  granite.\\n\\n600\\n\\n500\\n\\n400\\n\\n300\\n\\n200\\n\\n100\\n\\n0\\n\\n50

increasing  the  temperature  to  an  extreme\\nvalue  may   cause  weakening  of  the  grain  boundaries,  dependent  on\\nthe  anisotropy  of  the  rock  matrix  (due  to  potentially  existing  distinct  mineral  compounds  in  granite  those  may   contain  different\\nthermo-elastic  moduli  and  this  may   causes  to  generate  different  internal  stresses  with  heating).  according  to  wong  and  brace\\n(1979),  increasing  the  temperature  causes  the  induction  of  thermal\\ncracks  in  the  rock  mass  due  to  the  associated  generation  of  internal\\nstresses  (eq.

(2))\\nexceeds  the  crack  closure  pressure  with  increasing  temperature,\\nthermal  cracks  form  and  further  increase  of  temperature  provides\\nthe  surface  energy  required  for  the  propagation  of  the  initiated\\ncrack  (zuo  et  al.,  2007).  this  results  in  alteration  of  the  grain-tograin  contacts  in  the  rock  matrix,  which  leads  to  reduced  cohesion\\nat  higher  temperatures.  in  the  case  of  the  variation  of  friction  angle\\nwith  increasing  temperature,  the  granite  friction  angle  appears  to\\nremain  steady  up  to  around  100 ◦c  (52◦)  and  then  slightly  increases\\nwith  increasing  temperature  (54◦ at  200  and  300 ◦ c,  respectively).\\nthe  friction  between  grain-to-grain  contacts  may  be  altered  by\\nthe  thermally-induced  micro-structural  modiﬁcations.  however,\\nthis  effect  on  grain  contact  is  expected  to  be  smaller  at  relatively\\nlow  temperatures,  resulting  in  relatively  steady  friction  angle  with\\nincreasing  temperature  at  lower  temperatures.  however,  a  slight\\n\\nments  non-linearity  must  be  taken  into  account.  in  addition  to  the\\nconﬁnement,  according  to  this  study,  increasing  temperature  also\\nalters  the  failure  envelope  of  granite.  an  initial  increment  in  deviatoric  stress  with  increasing  temperature  can  be  observed  up  to\\n200 ◦c  and  further  increase  of  temperature  (to  300 ◦c)  causes  it  to\\nbe  slightly  reduced.\\n\\nthe  temperature-dependent  shear  parameters  of  granite  were\\ninvestigated  next,  and  the  shear  parameters  can  be  obtained\\nfrom  the  mohr-coulomb  failure  envelope.  as  suggested  by  singh\\net  al.

(1997),  the  development  of  local  stress  concentrations  leads\\nto  the  initiation  of  many  intra-granular  micro-cracks  in  the  rock\\nmass,  and  the  crack  density  increases  with  increasing  deviatoric\\nstress  and  tends  to  merge  on  reaching  the  peak  stress,  resulting  in\\nstrain  softening  and  shear  localization.  these  damage  processes  are\\nclearly  identiﬁed  by  the  intense  ae  activities  in  the  ﬁeld  (chang  and\\nlee,  2004).  ae  technology  was  therefore  used  to  investigate  the  progressive  fracturing  behaviour  in  strathbogie  granite  under  tri-axial\\nconditions.  fig.  11  illustrates  the  cumulative  ae  events  with  axial\\nstress  at  various  pressures  and  temperatures  for  the  tested  specimens.  the  corresponding  variations  of  deviatoric  stress  against\\nstrain  are  also  included  in  the  same  plots  to  identify  the  stress\\nthresholds  for  crack  closure,  crack  initiation  and  crack  damage\\n(table  4).  the  very  high  ae  counts  in  strathbogie  granite  at  dilatancy\\nin  the  pre-failure  stage  are  due  to  the  fact  that  ae  waves  generate\\nwhen  the  local  shear  stress  concentration  at  a  grain  contact  is  sufﬁciently  high  to  rupture  the  grain  boundaries,  and  frictional  slips\\nand  grain  rotations  may   occur  once  the  grain  contacts  have  lost\\ntheir  cohesion.\\n\\nin  the  present  study,  crack  threshold  ratios  were  deﬁned  to  identify  the  temperature  and  pressure-dependent  crack  propagation  in\\nthe  tested  granite  as  follows,  and  fig.  12  shows  the  crack  propagation  stress  threshold  ratios  of  granite  specimens  tested  at  various\\nconﬁning  pressures  and

higher  conﬁning  pressures.  however,  the  crack  damage  stress  increases  with  increasing\\nconﬁnement  due  to  the  inﬂuence  of  conﬁning  pressure  on  thermal\\ncrack  development  and  the  suppression  of  the  extension/widening\\nof  existing  micro-cracks.  according  to  fig.  12,  in  the  temperature  range  considered  here,  three  tendencies  can  be  identiﬁed\\nwith  increasing  conﬁning  pressure:  increase  of  the  elastic  deformation  region,  decrease  of  the  stable  crack  propagation  region,  and\\nincrease  of  the  unstable  crack  propagation  region.  the  crack  initiation  stress  threshold  also  progressively  increases  with  increasing\\nconﬁning  pressure,  which  can  be  attributed  to  the  fact  that  the\\nbrittle  behaviour  of  rock  specimens  at  lower  conﬁning  pressures\\nchanges  to  quasi-brittle  behaviour  with  increasing  conﬁning  pressure.  this  is  because  the  suppression  of  micro-crack  development\\nis  less  at  low  conﬁning  pressures,  and  therefore  sudden  failures  mostly  occur,  and  the  beginning  of  crack  initiation  occurs\\n\\nat  earlier  stages  of  deviatoric  loading  at  high  conﬁning  pressures\\ndue  to  the  higher  normal  stress  acting  on  micro-cracks,  resulting  in  limited  progression  of  cracking  before  failure.  in  relation\\nto  the  temperature  effect,  increasing  the  temperature  causes  an\\ninitial  increment  in  the  crack  propagation  stress  threshold,  followed  by  a  slight  reduction  for  all  the  temperature  conditions\\nconsidered.  for  example,  at  30  mpa   conﬁnement,  the  crack  damage  stress  threshold  ratios  increased  by  around  6.8%,  10.5%  with\\nincreasing  temperature  from  room  temperature  to  100  and  200 ◦c,\\nrespectively,  and  reduced  by  around  4.0%  when  the  temperature\\nincreased  to  300 ◦c.  this  implies  that  at  low  temperatures  a  suppressed  micro-crack  development  mechanism  is  dominant,  and\\nincreasing  the  temperature  causes  crack  damage  to  occur  at  earlier  loading  stages.  interestingly,  at  60  mpa   conﬁnement  the  crack\\ndamage  stress  threshold  ratio  increased  by  around  4.9%,  5.4%,\\n2.6%  with  increasing  temperature  from  room  to  100,  200  and\\n300 ◦c,  respectively.  this  exhibits  the  cumulative  effect  of  temperature  and  pressure  micro-crack  development  in  the  rock  mass.\\nat  relatively  low  temperatures,  micro-crack  propagation  may  be\\ninhibited  by  the  thermally-induced  plasticity  mechanism  which\\noccurs  at  crack  tips  and  the  increased  bonding  strength  through\\nthermally-induced  rock  matrix  expansion  (which  increases  crack\\nstress  thresholds).  however,  further  increase  of  temperature  creates  thermally-induced  cracks  and  causes  the  grain  boundary\\ncracks  to  widen,  resulting  in  early  crack  damage.  further,  with  the\\ninﬂuence  of  conﬁnement,  micro-crack  development  is  suppressed,\\ncausing  a  relatively  low  increment  of  crack  damage  stress  threshold\\nratios  at  higher  conﬁnements.\\n\\n3.5.  corresponding  alterations  in  granite  micro-structure\\n\\na\\n\\n  comprehensive  micro-structural  analysis  was   also  performed\\nto  identify  the  interior

microstructural\\nbehaviour  at  200 ◦c,  at  which  the  highest  strength  increment  was\\nobserved,  and  400 ◦c,  at  which  clear  thermally-induced  rock  mass\\nweakening  was  observed.  a  specimen  at  room  temperature  was\\nused  as  a  control.\\n\\nbased  on  optical  microscope  imaging,  mineralogical  assembling\\nin  the  granite  specimen  could  be  identiﬁed  by  the  colour  and  texture  of  each  of  the  mineral  assemblages.  further,  a  detailed  sem\\nstudy  was   performed  using  scanning  electron  imaging  (sei)  and\\nbsei  back-scatter  electron  imaging  (bsei)  techniques.  bsei  images\\ntaken  at  low  magniﬁcations  clearly  show  different  mineral  assemblages  and  grain  boundaries  (see  fig.  14).  using  energy-dispersive\\nx-ray  (edx)  technology  with  aztec  oxford  instruments,  chemical  component  mapping  was  generated  in  each  specimen,  and\\neach  mineral  was  identiﬁed  qualitatively.  the  bright  colour  images\\nobserved  in  edx  images  indicate  higher  concentration  (higher\\nenergy  dispersion)  while  dark  colour  areas  indicate  lower  concentration  (lower  energy  dispersion).  based  on  the  spectrum  of  each\\npoint  (point  id),  the  corresponding  mineral  was  identiﬁed  and  a\\nmap   spectrum  provided  overall  elements  available  for  each  specimen.\\n\\naccording  to

seem  to  play  a  signiﬁcant  role  at  relatively  low  temperatures,  probably  due  to  the\\npresence  of  relatively  high  k  feldspar  and  biotite  contents.  similar  observations  have  been  reported  in  bauer  and  johnson’s  (1979)\\nstudy  conducted  for  charcoal  granite,  where  intra-granular  microcracks  predominantly  occur  compared  to  grain  boundary  cracks.\\nthe  sem  analysis  is  also  consistent  with  this  ﬁnding,  which  exhibits\\ninhibition  of  micro-crack  development  followed  by  micro-cracking\\nat  relatively  high  temperatures.\\n\\nthe  crack  propagation  process  in  any  rock  mass  is  largely\\ninﬂuenced  by  the  mineralogical  composition,  because  cracks  normally  propagate  through  weaker  planes  of  the  rock  mass.  since\\ngranite  is  an  igneous  type  of  rock,  two  main  types  of  thermallyinduced  cracking  modes  can  be  identiﬁed:  inter-granular  and  intragranular.  the  amount  of  inter-granular  or  intra-granular  cracking\\nis  dependent  on  the  stress  state,  rock  type  and  mineralogy  of\\nthe  rock  mass.  inter-granular  cracks  occur  along  grain  boundaries,\\npre-existing  faults  and  micro-cracks  of  the  rock,  while  intragranular  cracks  occur  through  weaker  mineralogical  constituents\\n(kranz,  1983).  for  example,  k feldspar  and  biotite  are  weaker\\n\\nmineralogical  constituents  due  to  their  large  crystals  (>10  mm),\\nas  crystals  greater  than  2–3  mm  in  size  are  generally  deﬁned  as\\nweaker  mineralogical  constituents  compared  to  equi-dimensional\\nsmall  crystals  like  quartz  (homand-etienne  and  houpert,  1989).\\nbased  on  experimental  results,  intra-granular  cracking  is  highly\\ntemperature-dependent  due  to  the  temperature dependent  dislocations  in  the  rocks.  this  is  because  different  mineralogical\\ncomponents  have  different  thermo-elastic  moduli  and  thermal\\nconductivities  (kranz,  1983;  dwivedi  et  al.,  2008).\\n\\nthese  observations  suggest  that  micro-cracking  in  granite  is\\nhighly  temperature dependent,  as  evidenced  by  the  previously\\nobserved  initial  strength  gain  followed  by  slight  strength  reduction  with  increasing  temperature  in  the  tested  granite.  however,\\nthis  shows  that  granite  needs  to  be  heated  to  a  sufﬁcient  temperature  to  cause  thermal  cracks  in  it  and  therefore,  heating  to  a  lower\\ntemperature  may   only  cause  a  strength  gain  through  the  thermal\\nexpansion  of  the  rock  matrix.  this  is  consistent  with  the  results\\nof  bauer  and  johnson  (1979).  the  mechanical  properties  of  charcoal  granite  in  their  study  remained  relatively  steady  until  200 ◦c,\\nand  westerly  granite  exhibited  a  signiﬁcant  thermal  dependency,\\neven  at  relatively  low  temperatures  (<200 ◦c).  in  homand-etienne\\nand  houpert  (1989)  study,  the  variation  of  uni-axial  compressive\\nstrength  of  both  semones  and  remiremont  granites  is  insigniﬁcant\\nuntil  400 ◦c,  followed  by  signiﬁcant  reductions  at  higher  temperatures.  these  results  indicate  the  dependency  of  mineralogical\\ncomposition  and  grain  size  distribution  on  the  temperature dependent  mechanical  behaviour  in  various  types  of  granites.

four  different  conﬁning  pressures  (10,  30,\\n60,  90  mpa)  and  four  different  temperatures  (rt,  100,  200,  300 ◦c),\\nsimulating  various  geothermal  reservoir  conditions.  the  following\\nconclusions  can  be  drawn:\\n• mechanical  behaviour  of  the  tested  granite  is  inﬂuenced  by  both\\nreservoir  depth  and  temperature,  and  the  depth  effect  is  much\\ngreater  than  the  temperature  effect.\\n• granite \\nlocated  at  relatively  smaller  depths  appears  to  fail\\nthrough  shear  localization  and  increasing  depth  may  cause  this\\nto  change  to  ductile  failure  through  strain  hardening.  a  progressive  enhancement  in  stress  threshold  with  increasing  conﬁning\\npressure  is  observed  in  strathbogie  granite.  such  behaviours\\nexhibit  greater  strength  and  lower  brittle  characteristics  in  granite  located  at  greater  depths.\\n• increasing  of  temperature  causes  granite’s  strength  to  be\\nenhanced  up  to  a  certain  temperature  (around  200 ◦c  for  strathbogie  granite)  through  the  possible  thermal  expansion  of  the\\nrock  matrix  and  further  increasing  of  temperature  may   cause  it\\nto  weaken  by  inducing  thermal  cracks.  this  was  conﬁrmed  by\\nthe  micro-structural  analysis,  which  did  not  reveal  any  noticeable  amount  of  thermally-induced  micro-cracking  in  strathbogie\\ngranite  up  to  200 ◦c,  and  heating  of  the  granite  to  a  greater  temperature  as  400 ◦c  caused  many  intra-granular  cracks  in  quartz\\nand  feldspar  and  some  grain  boundary  cracks  between  quartz  and\\nfeldspar  minerals.  furthermore,  according  to  ae  analysis,  increasing  the  temperature  ﬁrst  causes  the  crack  propagation  stress\\nthreshold  to  increase  and  further  increasing  of  the  temperature\\ncauses  it  to  be  slightly  reduced.  this  indicates  a  suppression  of\\nmicro-cracks  at  low  temperatures  by  matrix  expansion  and  the\\ndevelopment  of  micro-cracks  through  thermally-induced  damage  at  higher  temperatures.\\n• finally  an  attempt  was  made  to  improve  the  conventional  mohrcoulomb  failure  criteria  for  geothermal  reservoirs  with  extreme\\npressures  and  temperatures,  because  the  conventional  criteria\\nare  not  applicable  to  extreme

(cid:2)2 inﬂuence  (which  has  been  proven  to  have  a  substantial\\ninﬂuence  on  rock  strength)  and  the  assumed  linearity  (the  strength\\ncriteria  of  rock  are  non-linear  in  reality).  after  re-analyzing  thousands  of  reported  triaxial  experiments  and  combining  the  critical\\nstate  concept  proposed  by  barton  (1976),  singh  et  al.  (2011)  proposed  a  non-linear  mohr-coulomb  failure  criterion.  according  to\\nthe  ﬁndings  of  singh  et  al.  (2011),  the  mohr-coulomb  shear  strength\\nparameters  should  only  be  obtained  by  performing  conventional\\ntri-axial  tests  under  low  conﬁning  stresses  (in  the  linear  region  of\\nthe  mohr-coulomb  failure  envelope).  according  to  their  statistical\\nanalysis,  (cid:2)cc ≈\\n  (cid:2)crit,  where  (cid:2)c and  (cid:2) crit are  uni-axial  compressive\\nstrength  and  critical  conﬁning  pressure,  respectively.  the  modiﬁed\\nmohr-coulomb  failure  criterion  proposed  by  singh  et  al.  is  given\\nbelow:\\n(cid:2)1 −\\n  (cid:2)3 =\\nwhere,  (cid:2)ci ≈\\n\\n

improved  mohr-coulomb  failure  criteria\\ncannot  be  directly  applied  to  geothermal  reservoir  rocks  at  extreme\\npressures  and  temperatures,  because  the  strength  response  is\\naltered  by  the  thermal  effect  (heuze,  1983).  to  date,  no  extensive\\nstudy  has  captured  this  thermal  response  in  the  improved  mohrcoulomb  failure  criteria.  such  a  realistic  approach  is  necessary\\nfor  deep  underground  engineering  applications  like  geothermal\\nenergy  extraction.  the  concepts  of  barton  (1976)  and  singh  et  al.\\n(2011)  are  therefore  incorporated  into  the  temperature  inﬂuence\\nin  this  study  and  an  attempt  is  made  to  propose  novel  strength  criteria  for  geothermal  reservoir  rocks  based  on  experimental  data:\\n\\n+

wang, 2014). site selection for china's hlw repository started in 1985 (wang, 2010). the efforts have been focused on potential hlw repository sites located within granite intrusions in mainland china. since 1999, the beijing research  ⁎ corresponding author.  e-mail address: xingguang100@126.com (x.g. zhao).  http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tecto.2016.06.021 0040-1951/© 2016 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.  institute of uranium geology (briug) has performed site characterization studies in the beishan area, china. so far, the beishan area has been considered as the most potential candidate area for china's hlw repository.  among all the engineering properties of crystalline rocks at a potential hlw repository site, the thermal conductivity is one of the most important parameters in design consideration because it has a direct impact on the evaluation of the necessary repository volume and the optimization of the repository layout (sundberg and hellström, 2009). for instance, in the swedish kbs-3 concept for geological disposal of spent fuel, copper canisters with cast iron inserts containing the spent fuel are surrounded by bentonite for isolation and mechanical protection (brantberger et al., 2006). the heat generated by the spent fuel will increase the temperature of all components of the repository. for the bentonite buffer outside the canisters, the peak temperature must not exceed 100 °c. this requirement implies that the canisters cannot be deposited arbitrarily close to each other. on the other hand, unnecessarily large distances between the canisters will mean inefﬁcient and costly use of the repository rock volume (hökmark et al., 2009). to fulﬁll the temperature requirement, the rocks with low thermal conductivities will  \\x0cx.g. zhao et al. / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137  125  lead to a larger distance between canisters than for a case with high thermal conductivities. this is because the rocks with low thermal conductivities will give rise to higher temperatures in the bentonite (sundberg et al., 2008). hence, to design and construct repositories successfully, it is essential to perform an accurate assessment of the thermal conductivity characteristics of the host rock. over the past few decades, various experimental approaches have been employed to measure the thermal conductivity of rocks. the results indicate that the thermal conductivity of rocks is closely associated with mineral composition, porosity, texture, and density, etc. (birch and clark, 1940; clauser and huenges, 1995; hartmann et al., 2005; özkahraman et al., 2004; pasquale et al., 2015; ray et al., 2007; sundberg et al., 2009). for crystalline rocks with relatively homogeneous texture and low porosity, the mineral composition dominates the thermal conductivity. in volcanic and sedimentary rocks, the high variability of porosity in these rocks is a major factor controlling the thermal conductivity (clauser and huenges, 1995; özkahraman et al., 2004). for example, increasing porosity, which acts as barrier to the ﬂow of heat, often results in both lower p-wave velocity and lower thermal conductivity values (özkahraman et al., 2004). for a given rock, water content and temperature have an inﬂuence on its thermal conductivity. generally, the thermal conductivity of the rock increases and decreases with increasing water content (cho and kwon, 2010; cho et al., 2009) and temperature (abdulagatova et al., 2009; birch and clark, 1940; heuze, 1983; miao et al., 2014; mottaghy et al., 2008; vosteen and schellschmidt, 2003), respectively. moreover, the effect of water saturation on the thermal conductivity of rocks shows a generally increasing trend with increasing porosity (nagaraju and roy, 2014). given that the thermal conductivity of surrounding rocks around the excavations will be changed by the excavation-induced stress, some researchers studied the inﬂuence of pressure on the thermal conductivity of rocks (abdulagatova et al., 2010; abdulagatova et al., 2009; demırcı et al., 2004; görgülü et al., 2008; sibbitt, 1976; walsh and decker, 1966; zimmerman, 1989). one of the main ﬁndings achieved from these investigations shows that the thermal conductivity  varies with the pressure exerted on the rock. with increasing applied pressure, the thermal conductivity starts to increase and subsequently the increase rate tends to be a constant value due to gradual closure of cracks and pores within the rock (görgülü et al., 2008; walsh and decker, 1966).  while the above-mentioned studies provide meaningful insight into the thermal conductivity of various rocks, the thermal conductivity characteristics of low-porosity crystalline rocks subjected to different external factors such as water saturation, temperature and compression stress have not been fully understood. on the other hand, the information on the thermal conductivity of rocks in a potential hlw repository site must be known with sufﬁcient conﬁdence to provide necessary input conditions for its long-term safety assessment, which is one of the motivations for this study. in this work, experimental investigations on the thermal conductivity of the beishan granitic rocks are conducted using the transient plane source (tps) method. in the following discussion, rock sampling and basic physical properties of the rock specimens are introduced ﬁrst. testing facilities and procedures are then described. subsequently, the water saturation, temperature and compression stress dependent thermal conductivity characteristics of the tested rocks are evaluated comprehensively, and ﬁnally some insights are obtained.  2. rock sampling and preparation  the beishan area is situated in gansu province of northwestern china (see fig. 1). after a long geological evolution and weathering process, the topography of this area is characterized by a ﬂat gobi and small gentle rolling hills with elevations ranging between 1400 and 2000 m above the sea level. the crust in this area possesses a blocky structure with many granite intrusions (see fig. 2). other surrounding rocks include mainly metamorphic and sedimentary rocks, as well as quaternary cover. rock sampling was carried out in the jijicao and xinchang rock blocks, which are currently considered as two of the key investigation sub-areas during site selection and characterization.  fig. 1. geographical location of the beishan area and a photo showing its typical topography.  \\x0c126  x.g. zhao et al. / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137  xinchang  bs06  bs18  bs19  jijicao  bs16  bs15  bs05  n  2.5 km  granitic rock  sedimentary rock  metamorphic rock  quaternary cover  borehole  fault  fig. 2. rock sampling from six boreholes in the jijicao and xinchang sub-areas for thermal conductivity measurements.  intact drill cores with a diameter of approximately 63 mm were taken from six sub-vertical boreholes (i.e., boreholes bs05, bs06, bs15, bs16, bs18 and bs19) in these two sub-areas. the borehole locations are presented in fig. 2.  field observations indicated that the collected granitic rocks were relatively isotropic in texture and mineralogical composition. to evaluate the geological nature of the rocks, a series of thin sections were prepared and then exposed to cross-polarized light under an optical microscope to identify the dominant minerals in the rocks. the percentages of the dominant minerals were determined by point counting on thin sections. for each thin section approximately 500 points covering phenocrysts and groundmass were counted. according to the quartz-alkali feldspar-plagioclase (qap) diagram (streckeisen, 1976), the rocks can further be classiﬁed. it can be observed from fig. 3 that the rocks contain mainly a moderate to low amount of quartz and alkali feldspar, and a moderate to high amount of plagioclase. this means that the collected rocks dominantly range from granodiorite to monzogranite. for grain size characteristics, the rocks are from ﬁne grained to, medium to coarse grained. an overview of the basic information of the rocks is listed in table 1. based on the borehole no. and sampling depth, these rocks have been divided into eight groups.  a total of 47 pairs of rock specimens, 50 mm in diameter, were prepared from the drill cores with a length to diameter ratio of approximately 0.5. in particular, specimen ends were polished carefully using a  q  90          90  i granodiorite ii monzogranite  60                                   60          ii         i    bs05 bs06 bs15 bs16 bs18-1 bs18-2 bs19-1 bs19-2  20                                                                     20  5                                                                                  5 p  10                 35                       65                  90  a  fig. 3. qap classiﬁcation of the eight rock groups based on modal analysis.  grinding machine until the ﬂatness and roughness of the ends are less than 10 μm and 3 μm, respectively. the ﬂat and polished specimen end surfaces minimize the thermal contact resistance during thermal conductivity measurement. a minimum of ten specimens for each rock group were prepared.  3. test methodology  3.1. an introduction to the used tps method  in the ﬁelds of geology and geophysics, laboratory approaches to measuring soil and rock thermal conductivity can mainly be divided into two groups: steady state and transient state. in this work, the transient plane source (tps) method (gustafsson, 1991; log and gustafsson, 1995) was utilized to measure the thermal conductivity of the specimens. as one of the transient measurement methods, the tps technique is based on the use of a transiently heated plane sensor (i.e., hot disk sensor) and a hot disk thermal constants analyser (see fig. 4a). the used hot disk tps2500s system can measure thermal conductivity of materials ranging from 0.01 to 400 w/mk. the hot disk sensor consists of a continuous double spiral, which is etched out of a thin nickel foil (fig. 4e). this spiral is sandwiched between two sheets of electrical insulation materials made of kapton. the sensor acts both as a heat source for increasing the temperature of the specimens and as a dynamic temperature sensor for recording the temperature increase. during the measurement, the temperature in the sensor rises and heat starts to ﬂow to the specimens. the temperature rise in the sensor provides an indicator of the thermal properties of the specimens. if the specimens have good thermal conducting properties, the heat will be transported rapidly inside the specimens. on the contrary, if the specimens have good thermal insulation properties, the sensor temperature will rise faster and the heat will not be transported as much as in the test of the good thermal conducting specimens. compared with steady state measurement methods such as the divided bar (beck and beck, 1958; birch, 1950; sass et al., 1971) and the guarded hot plate (abdulagatova et al., 2009; alishaev et al., 2012), one of significant advantages of the tps technique is that the thermal conductivity of materials can be measured more quickly, typically from several to tens of seconds. hence, a long wait for thermal gradients to equilibrate is not required and the moisture migration in response to temperature gradients was minimized (jackson and taylor, 1986). on the other hand, unlike some transient methods such as thermal needle probes (barry-macaulay et al., 2013; von herzen and maxwell, 1959), which are commonly used for soils and soft rocks, the tps method can be  \\x0cx.g. zhao et al. / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137  127  table 1 basic information and geological description of the tested rocks.  rock type and group  basic information  mineral composition  naked eye observation  photomicrograph of a thin section  monzogranite (bs05)  location: jijicao borehole no.: bs05 sampling depth: 5–7 m number of specimen pairs: 7 grain size: medium  plagioclase: 33.7% ± 5.8%;

popov et al., 2003). hence, the thermal resistance between the specimen ends and the sensor exists (see section 3.2). so far, the tps technology has been widely used to  \\x0c128  x.g. zhao et al. / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137  a   c   temperature control system  b   hot disk thermal   constants analyser   sensor   platen   specimens  d   e   specimens  insulation material  chamber   sensor   specimens   oil bath   sensor   double spiral  cable extension  fig. 4. the hot disk tps2500s system (a) used to measure the thermal conductivity of specimens under room temperature (d), high temperature (c), and uniaxial compression (b) conditions. a hot disk sensor showing its key components (e).  determine the thermal properties of different materials (lagüela et al., 2015;

θ ¼ a2=d  where t is the time measured from the start of the transient recording, θ is the characteristic time, which depends both on parameters of the sensor and the sample, and d is the thermal diffusivity of the sample.  according to eq. (2), and δtðτþ and d(τ) plotted as a function of τ provides a linear relationship with a slope that is a function of p0, a, and k. thermal conductivity k can be obtained by ﬁtting the experimental data to the straight line given by eq. (2); thermal diffusivity d is calculated from eq. (3) taking into account the τ value determined in the previous ﬁt.  as mentioned above, the solution of the thermal conductivity equation is based on the assumption that the hot disk sensor is located in an inﬁnite material in perfect contact with the sensor surface. this means that the heat ﬂow generated from each measurement must not reach the outside boundaries of the specimen (hot disk, 2007). meanwhile, a careful preparation of specimen ends is required to minimize thermal contact resistance. an estimation of how far the heat ﬂow has proceeded in the specimen during a recording is the probing depth δp, which is deﬁned as (hot disk, 2007):  ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ p dt  δp ¼ 2  ð4þ  to determine the thermal conductivity with good accuracy, the shortest distance from any part of the sensor to the nearest outside boundary of the sample should be larger than δp. in our experiments, the used hot disk sensor has a radius of 6.403 mm. the shortest distance is about 19 mm, and the probing depth is approximately 10 mm. for this probing depth value, we can consider that we are conducting a bulk measurement.  3.3. test procedures  3.3.1. tests on specimens under saturated and dry conditions  firstly, the specimens were immersed by deionized water in a vacuum for a period of 96 h. the specimens were then taken from the vacuum and the water droplets on the surfaces were wiped dry, care

constant under vacuum within 72 h (see fig. 5), indicating that the specimens were saturated with water. subsequently, the hot disk sensor was horizontally placed between the two saturated specimen pieces with the double spiral centered and totally covered, and the two specimen pieces were ﬁrmly clamped together to ensure that there was no air gap between the sensor and the specimen end surfaces, as presented in fig. 4d. in order to remain water saturation, the saturated specimens and the sensor were kept in a plastic bag during thermal conductivity measurement (adl-zarrabi, 2004). after the test, the used water-saturated specimens were suffered from dehydration treatment in a thermostatic drying oven at 105 °c for a period of 24 h and subsequently cooled in a desiccator to measure the thermal conductivity under a dry condition. meanwhile, the mass of the dry specimens (mdry) was measured, and the porosity (n) of the specimens was calculated using the equations  n ¼ 100v p  v %  v p ¼ msat − mdry  ρw  ð5þ  ð6þ  where v is the bulk rock volume, vp is the pore volume, and ρw is the density of water. for each pair of specimens saturated or dried, measurements on the thermal conductivity were carried out at room temperature (25 ± 1 °c).  3.3.2. tests on specimens under increasing temperature  to investigate the effect of temperature on the thermal conductivity of the tested rocks, measurements were performed on dry specimens from 40 °c to 150 °c based on the requirements of the used test equipment. compared with measurements at room temperature, the experiments under high temperature are time consuming due to a slow stepwise heating process by using a constant temperature oil bath and a temperature control system, as shown in fig. 4c. the thermal conductivity measurement can only be conducted until the two specimen pieces in the chamber with a specimen holder within the oil bath have reached thermal equilibrium and kept a target temperature value. during thermal equilibrium of the oil bath, the hot disk sensor monitors continuously the temperature variation of the specimens. for our tests, the thermal conductivity of the specimens was measured when the recorded temperature variation of the specimens is less than 0.04 °c. in general, 32 h were needed to complete one test. a typical temperature-time history during the test is

measurement, the load was maintained constant for a period of about 15 min to avoid residual temperature drifts on the specimens. based on the in-situ stress measurement results obtained from the beishan area (zhao et al., 2013), the maximum axial compression stress applied to the specimens was set to be 45 mpa to approximately simulate the excavation-induced stress near the vertical hlw disposal element boundary at a depth of 600 m. the axial stress applied to the specimens was recorded automatically, and the used stress path throughout the course of testing is presented in fig. 7. the experiments were conducted at room temperature.  according to previous experimental results (zhao et al., 2015a; zhao et al., 2015b), the identiﬁed crack initiation stresses of cylindrical specimens of beishan granitic rocks under uniaxial compression using the cumulative ae hit (caeh) method range from 45.3 to 109.1 mpa, which are larger than the maximum compression stress adopted in the present study. hence, the stress-induced rock damage might not occur in the tested specimens during loading. it should be mentioned that in the process of loading, the friction may occur at the interfaces between the specimen ends and the sensor. due to limitation of the tps measurement technique, the utilized test method does not consider the potential inﬂuence of interface friction effect on the experimental results. to reduce or eliminate the friction effect, further efforts are needed to produce innovative design for the test equipment. although not perfect, the developed test system provides a feasible means for us to gain insight into thermal conductivity behaviors of rocks under compression.  4. test results  4.1. inﬂuence of water saturation on the thermal conductivity  table

content of the specimens, leading to difﬁculties in evaluating the relationship between the thermal conductivity and the water saturation degree of the specimens quantitatively.  3.3.3. tests on specimens under uniaxial compression  the uniaxial compression tests on dry specimens were conducted using a hydraulic servo-controlled compression machine. for each test, two specimen pieces with the hot disk sensor were contained between steel platens machined to match their end surfaces, as shown in fig. 4b. the interfaces between the specimens and the steel platens were daubed with a thin layer of lubricant to reduce the end effect of the platens during loading. when the experimental setup was completed, axial-load control was used with a loading rate of 100 n/s and the axial load was increased with an increment  thermal conductivity measurements were carried out on the 40 pairs of specimens both in dry and water-saturated conditions, and the results are listed in table 2. a statistical analysis shows that for the eight rock groups under dry or saturated state, the standard deviation (sd) and coefﬁcient of variation (cov) of the thermal conductivity are all less than 0.06 w/mk and 4%, respectively, indicating that the results between specimens in each rock group have a good consistency. for all rock groups, the average thermal conductivity values in the dry state

the dry specimens were saturated with water, water with a higher thermal conductivity (0.604 w/mk) replaced the air with a lower thermal conductivity (0.025 w/mk) in the void of the rocks, leading to

 to 150 °c. the thermal conductivity of these specimens at room temperature (25 °c) was also measured and the data were added to this ﬁgure. it is seen that the thermal conductivity of the specimens shows a decaying trend with increasing temperature, and the values at 150 °c range from 5.7% to 8.7% lower than those at room temperature. this means that within the used temperature range, the inﬂuence of the increasing temperature on the decay of thermal conductivity for these rocks is limited. on the other hand, a possible reason for the gradual decrease in thermal conductivity is the generation of thermally induced microcracks in the rocks because of a mismatch between thermal expansion coefﬁcients of adjacent mineral grains in a homogeneous temperature ﬁeld (jansen et al., 1993), which has been demonstrated from a microcracking perspective based on numerical simulations (zhao, 2016). based on the experimental data, the relationship between thermal conductivity and temperature can be described using the equation: k ¼ kr − at2  ð8þ  where kr is the thermal conductivity of the rock at room temperature (25 °c), t is the temperature in celsius, and a is the ﬁt coefﬁcient (see table 3). the parameter a affects the decaying velocity of the thermal conductivity with the temperature, i.e., the decaying velocity of the thermal conductivity increases as a increases. as shown in table 3, a in eq. (8) varies from rock to rock and can be determined only using laboratory tests. in order to develop a model for predicting a,   individual fit  overall fit (model)  bs15-07  bs18-1-08  bs06-05 bs18-2-05 bs19-1-05 bs05-07  bs16-05  2.9  2.8  2.7  2.6  2.5  2.4  2.3  2.2  thermal conductivity (w/mk)  0  20  40  80  60 100 temperature (oc)  120  140  160  fig. 13. comparison of overall ﬁt using the temperature and rock porosity dependent thermal conductivity model and individual ﬁt of seven pairs of specimens in different rock groups.  behavior. however, with further increase of rock porosity, the approximately linear relationship between kdry and ksat is not valid anymore. for example, the rock groups bs05 and bs15 with average porosity values greater than or equal to 0.68% exhibit higher thermal conductivity in the water-saturated state relative to the dry state.  to evaluate the thermal conductivity of rocks, various mixing models such as the geometric mean (lichtenecker, 1924), the arithmetic mean (voigt, 1928), the hashin–shtrikman mean (hashin and shtrikman, 1962), and the effective-medium mean (bruggeman, 1935; clauser, 2009) have been proposed. comprehensive overviews and case studies on such mixing models can be found in (abdulagatova et al., 2009; clauser, 2009; fuchs et al., 2013; hartmann, 2005; ray et al., 2015). based on the experimental data (see table 2) in combination with the methodology used by fuchs et al. (2013), the abovementioned mixing models were used to predict the thermal conductivity values of the tested rocks in the water-saturated state. fig. 9 shows the comparison between measured and calculated thermal conductivities for the four different models. it can be observed from fig. 9a, b, and d that the geometric mean, the arithmetic mean, and the effectivemedium mean yield similar prediction results and consistently underestimate the thermal conductivity of the eight rock groups, especially for the groups with relatively high porosity values (e.g., groups bs05 and bs15). the hashin–shtrikman mean shows a reasonably good ﬁt for all rock groups, as shown in fig. 9c. the analysis results are basically in line with observations reported by fuchs et al. (2013) because most of the evaluated mixing models used in their analysis also underestimate the thermal conductivity of the rocks. however, the geometric mean model was rated as the best ﬁt to their data set. it should be noted that the rocks used in their analysis covered different rock types with a large range in porosity, from almost zero to about 30%. in addition, the measured thermal conductivity values of these rocks spans the interval between 1.0 and 6.5 w/mk. the present investigations focused mainly on the granitic rocks with low porosities and a narrow thermal conductivity range. hence, the large difference of rock properties may result in uncertainties between analysis results obtained from various mixing models. more work is required to explain this discrepancy.  nagaraju and roy (2014) deﬁned the effect of water saturation on thermal conductivity (s) as a function of porosity of rocks, and s is expressed by s ¼ ksat − kdry  ð7þ  kdry  according to the measurement results listed in table 2, we established the relationship between s and the porosity of the rocks, as presented in fig. 10. analysis of fig. 10 reveals that the effect of water saturation on thermal conductivity of rocks presents an increasing trend with an increase of porosity. a linear form expression can ﬁt the data reasonably well while ensuring that the line passes through the origin.  4.2. inﬂuence of temperature on the thermal conductivity  fig. 11 presents the variation of thermal conductivity of seven pairs of dry specimens in different rock groups with temperature from 40 °c  table 3 fit coefﬁcient a for thermal conductivity-temperature curves of seven pairs of specimens in different rock groups.  rock type and specimen no.  monzogranite (bs05-07) granodiorite (bs06-05) monzogranite (bs15-07) granodiorite (bs16-05) monzogranite (bs18-1-08) granodiorite (bs18-2-05) monzogranite (bs19-1-07)  a (10−6)  8.821 5.679 8.394 4.871 6.891 5.728 6.385  r2  0.9830 0.9334 0.9853 0.9289 0.9262 0.9581 0.9933  132  x.g. zhao et al. / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137  \\x0cx.g. zhao et al. / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137  133  n=2  20  10 axial stress (mpa)  30  40  n=3  20  10 axial stress (mpa)  30  40  50  50  3.4  3.3  3.2  3.1  3.0  2.9  2.8  2.7  2.6  2.5  2.4  c  thermal conductivity (w/mk)  50  0  f  2.9  2.8  2.7  2.6  2.5  2.4  thermal conductivity (w/mk)  50  0  n=3  20  10 axial stress (mpa)  30  40  n=3  20  10 axial stress (mpa)  30  40  bs05 bs06 bs15 bs16 bs18-1 bs18-2 bs19-1 bs19-2  y=24.15-24.99e-x (r2=0.9296)  21  18  15  12  0369  i  r(%)   n=1  20  10 axial stress (mpa)  30  40  50  0.0  0.3  0.9  1.2 0.6 porosity (%)  1.5  1.8  b  3.0  2.9  2.8  2.7  2.6  2.5  2.4  thermal conductivity (w/mk)  50  0  3.2e 3.1  3.0  2.9  2.8  2.7  2.6  2.5  2.4  thermal conductivity (w/mk)  50  0  3.2h  3.1  3.0  2.9  2.8  2.7  2.6  thermal conductivity (w/mk)  50  0  n=3  20  10 axial stress (mpa)  30  40  n=3  20  10 axial stress (mpa)  30  40  n=2  20  10 axial stress (mpa)  30  40  3.0  2.9  2.8  2.7  2.6  2.5  2.4  2.3  2.2  a  thermal conductivity (w/mk)  3.0d 2.9  2.8  2.7  2.6  2.5  2.4  2.3  2.2  2.1  2.0  thermal conductivity (w/mk)  3.0g  2.9  2.8  2.7  2.6  2.5  2.4  thermal conductivity (w/mk)  0  0  0  fig. 14. inﬂuence of axial compression stress on the thermal conductivity of the eight rock groups: (a) bs05, (b) bs06, (c) bs15, (d) bs16, (e) bs18-1, (f) bs18-2, (g) bs19-1 and (h) bs19-2, and variation of the increase rate of the thermal conductivity (r) with rock porosity (i). error bars indicate the standard deviation of the thermal conductivity. n in the ﬁgures represents the number of specimen pairs in each rock group.  we attempted to relate a with other rock parameters and found that a depended on the magnitude of rock porosity (n), as presented in fig. 12. the coefﬁcient a varies with porosity n according to the following equation: a ¼ 9:43 − 0:71=n2  ð9þ  according to eqs.

(11) is not sensitive to the variation of rock porosity, and is within the range from 0.20 to 0.27 except for the rock group bs19-1. for simplicity, an average value of c = 0.24 obtained from table 4 is used to approximately describe the trend, as shown in fig. 15b. using eqs. (11)–(12) and the constant coefﬁcient c, an overall ﬁt is made for these rock groups to reproduce the rock porosity-dependent thermal conductivity under different axial stresses. a comparison between individual and overall ﬁt results is presented in fig. 16. it is found that for each rock group subjected to different compression stresses, the difference of the thermal conductivity values from the individual and overall ﬁts is less than 0.05 w/mk. the good agreement indicates that the established rock porosity-dependent model can capture the nonlinear stress-thermal conductivity relationships of the beishan granitic rocks satisfactorily.  5. discussion  one of the ﬁndings from the experimental investigations in the previous sections is that the rock porosity has an inﬂuence on the thermal conductivity of the beishan granitic rocks under water saturation, increasing temperature and compression stress conditions, although the porosity of tested rocks is relatively low. it is well known that for low-porosity crystalline rocks, the mineral composition plays an important role in dominating the thermal conductivity. the crystalline rocks are mainly made up of quartz, feldspars, and maﬁc minerals such as pyroxene, amphibole and biotite, and the content of minerals from these three mineral groups basically determines a rock's thermal conductivity (clauser and huenges, 1995). as mentioned in section 2, a model analysis on a total of 46 thin sections of the rocks was conducted to identify the dominant minerals in the rocks. as listed in table 1, the main minerals of these rocks include quartz, plagioclase, k-feldspar and biotite. among these four minerals, quartz has the highest thermal conductivity (7.69 w/mk) while another three minerals have a thermal conductivity range between 1.70 and 2.29 w/mk (horai, 1971). hence, when the porosity values of the specimens in different rock groups are close to each other, quartz content in the rocks may determine the thermal conductivity. according to the data listed in table 2, fig. 17a presents the inﬂuence of quartz content on the average thermal conductivity of different rock groups in dry state. it is seen that except for rock groups bs05 and bs15 (which have relatively large porosity values of 1.37% and 0.68%, respectively), thermal conductivity of the rocks appears an increasing trend with increasing quartz content. when the specimens are subjected to compression stresses, the original pores and cracks in the rocks tend to close, and the effective contact areas between mineral grains increase, leading to a signiﬁcant decay of the porosity effect on the thermal conductivity, especially for rocks with relatively high porosity. on the other hand, the closure of pores and cracks increases the contact opportunity of quartz grains, and hence improves the transportation capability of heat ﬂow in the rocks. under this condition, an obvious increase of the thermal conductivity for all rock groups with increasing quartz content can be observed, as presented in fig. 17b.  6. conclusions  beishan granitic rocks are candidate host rock types for china's hlw repository. in this paper, thermal conductivity characteristics of the beishan granitic rocks have been investigated using the transient plane source (tps) method. the measurement results indicate that for the used eight rock groups with a porosity range from 0.40% to 1.37%, the average thermal conductivity values in the dry state range between 2.412 and 2.812 w/mk. the values under water-saturated condition range from 2.602 to 3.156 w/mk. meanwhile, the effect of water saturation on thermal conductivity presents an increasing trend with an increase of rock porosity. using several mixing models proposed by previous researchers, we found that the hashin–shtrikman mean model showed a reasonably good ﬁt to the experimental data while another three models  currently obtained data, a best ﬁtting equation of axial stressdependent thermal conductivity for these rocks can be expressed as (demırcı et al., 2004) k ¼ k0 þ bσ c  ð11þ  1  where k0 is the thermal conductivity of the rock at zero stress, σ1 is the axial stress, and b and c are ﬁt coefﬁcients, as listed in table 4. analysis of eq. (11) reveals that the coefﬁcient b plays a critical role in controlling the increasing gradient of the thermal conductivity in the initial loading stage (i.e., crack closure stage). the coefﬁcient c dominantly affects the increasing velocity of the thermal conductivity in the subsequent elastic deformation stage. based on experimental investigations on the thermal conductivity of some rocks subjected to uniaxial stresses using a steady-state apparatus developed by demırcı et al. (2004), görgülü et al. (2008) found that the parameters b and c depended on the magnitude of elastic modulus of the rocks, and subsequently established an elastic modulus dependent model to predict the thermal conductivity values under pressure. unfortunately, in the present study, the elastic moduli of the tested rocks have not been available. therefore, the model proposed by görgülü et al. (2008) cannot be used to ﬁt our test results. according to fig. 14, we found that the increasing gradients of the thermal conductivities in the initial loading stage were generally large for the rocks with a high porosity such as rock groups bs05 and bs15. hence, the coefﬁcient b is associated with the rock porosity n, i.e., b increases as n increases, as presented in fig. 15a. an exponential form

thermal conductivity of the rocks under the water-saturated condition. future work is demanded to verify the validity of various mixing models using different rock types with a large porosity range.  with increasing temperature from 25 °c to 150 °c, the thermal conductivity of the rocks shows a decaying trend and the values at 150 °c range from 5.7% to 8.7% lower than those at room temperature, revealing that the inﬂuence of temperature on the thermal conductivity of the tested rocks is limited. in addition, the thermal conductivity of the rocks increases with increasing compression stress in a nonlinear behavior, and the increase rate of the thermal conductivity increases with an increase of rock porosity. it is found that the effects of compression stress and water saturation on the magnitude of thermal conductivity of the rocks are basically comparable. based on the experimental data, the empirical models considering the inﬂuence of rock porosity have been established for predicting the temperature and compression stress dependent thermal conductivity characteristics of the rocks, and the predictions are found to be in good agreement with experimental results. this study thus emphasizes importance of porosity on thermal conductivity measurements even for low porosity crystalline rocks.  when the pores and cracks in the rocks tend to close during compression, quartz content may determine the thermal conductivity, and there exists an increase of the thermal conductivity with increasing quartz content. this is because the closure of pores and cracks increases the contact opportunity of quartz grains, and hence improves the transportation capability of heat ﬂow in the rocks. while the test results provide insights into the thermal conductivity characteristics of beishan granitic rocks, one should be aware of the limitation of this study. because the thermal conductivity of granitic rocks is inﬂuenced by many factors. in order to better understand the thermal conductivity of granitic rocks related to rock characteristics such as rock fabric, grain shape, grain contact and grain size, comprehensive petrographic investigations are recommended in the future. in the meantime, studies should be carried out to understand how the interactions between mineral components affect the thermal conductivity. work is also being conducted to investigate the thermal conductivity of the rocks under coupled thermal-hydro-mechanical conditions.  acknowledgments  this work has been supported by the china atomic energy authority through the

tectonic regions is mainly controlled by permeability of fault zones. therefore, the characterization of fault zones is an important step toward performance assessment of a reservoir. the ﬂuid ﬂow is controlled also by pressure and temperature conditions. in this context, we simulated pressure and temperature ﬁelds to elaborate on the inﬂuence of permeability on subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow in the lahendong geothermal reservoir. thermal–hydraulic simulation is performed using a ﬁnite element approach. adjusting the permeability through 370 different cases, modeling results converged to the observed data within a misﬁt range of 0–7 %. the best ﬁtting models identiﬁed a deep-seated fault that has previously not been traced at the surface. simulated temperature distribution suggests a prominent convective heat ﬂow, driven by an upward migrating and sw–ne oriented ﬂuid ﬂow. this hydraulic gradient causes a pressure drop along the reservoir. highpressure patterns are used to constrain recharge areas, in addition to inﬁltration measurements. discharge ﬂow occurs from sw to ne migrating also upward toward the hot springs. in that frame, thermal–hydraulic simulations

engineering \\x01 pressure drop  introduction  it  geothermal energy is an essential component to supply future energy demands. requires developing new geothermal sites and improving the performance of existing systems to satisfy continuously growing demand. the productivity of a geothermal ﬁeld mainly depends on subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow, which in active tectonic regions is controlled by permeability of fault zones (moeck 2014). in that frame, the primary focus is on locating and characterizing faulted areas in geothermal ﬁelds. this study employs numerical modeling to allocate and quantify permeability anisotropies and discontinuities, e.g., faults, in order to understand their inﬂuence on subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow in geothermal reservoirs.  numerical models have been increasingly used to understand the setup and productivity of geothermal systems. a general overview of geothermal models has been given by o’sullivan et al. (2001). additionally, there are several sites exemplifying similar characteristics as in lahendong. the underground movement of hot and cold ﬂuids has been modeled for geothermal ﬁelds in new zealand (kaya et al. 2014). the kakkonda geothermal site, e.g., consists of two reservoirs at various depths with different ﬂuid properties. there, results from ﬂuid ﬂow analysis show the importance of fractures for ﬂuid transport enhancing the recharge or discharge in the reservoir  123  \\x0c1088 page 2 of 11  environ earth sci (2016) 75:1088  (mcguinness et al. 1995). generally, faults acting as preferential ﬂuid path ways signiﬁcantly change the pressure and temperature ﬁeld in the reservoir (cherubini et al. 2013). models for the seferihisar–balc¸ova ﬁeld focus on the ﬂuid ﬂow inside of faults. results show an enhanced upward heat transport through ﬂuids from bottom of the geothermal system (magri et al. 2011).  our test ground is the lahendong geothermal ﬁeld located in sulawesi, indonesia. the ﬁeld is owned and operated by p.t. pertamina geothermal energy and hosts a power plant with a production capacity of 80 mwe. there, geothermal exploration started in the early 1970s including geophysical and geohydrochemical approaches. it is a water-dominated magmatic structurally controlled system. faults generally act as across-fault ﬂuid barriers and alongfault ﬂuid conductors (brehme et al. 2014). as a result, hot springs mainly appear on the top of vertically permeable faults at the surface. available numerous drilling and surface measurements allowed a detailed characterization of the geological and hydrogeological setting of the area (fig. 1; brehme et al. 2011, 2013, 2014, 2016; wiegand et al. 2013). the model presented here is developed for investigating subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow and the permeability distribution including the fault zones in the lahendong geothermal ﬁeld. below, the geological structure of the  ﬁeld is presented followed by an introduction to the modeling approach.  detailed investigation of subsurface permeability distribution is a crucial step for site selection and smart drilling strategies. the numerical simulations presented will provide insight into understanding the subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow considering the hydraulic conductivity of faults. it ensures productive as well as sustainable operation of geothermal ﬁelds avoiding risks, such as drilling into non-fractured or cold zones, and targeting highly corroding waters. although the target area is lahendong, the general workﬂow is applicable for other geothermal sites consisting of similar constraints.  reservoir characterization  hydrogeology  the overall driving force for the ﬂuid ﬂow is the sw–ne oriented natural hydraulic gradient in the lahendong geothermal system. the direction of ﬂuid ﬂow varies through the geothermal site due to horizontal partitioning of the reservoir by relatively less permeable fault zones (brehme et al. 2014). the basic sections are located in the  fig. 1 topographic map of the study area with geological features, water and rock sample locations, and model cross section  123  \\x0cenviron earth sci (2016) 75:1088  page 3 of 11  1088  south, in the east, and beneath lake linau. beneath lake linau, the direction of ﬂuid ﬂow is slightly rotated to wsw–ene (fig. 1). also, types of ﬂuid change from one section to another, e.g., an acidic highly saline-type beneath lake linau and a neutral low saline-type south and east of lake linau (fig. 1). the impermeable structure across faults prevent the ﬂuids from diluting each other (brehme et al. 2016). however, faults are rather permeable along the vertical axis, which allows recharge of the system through the faults. rainwater inﬁltrates at a fault in the sw, at mt. lengkoan, and creek water inﬁltrates into the normal faults at lake linau (fig. 2). the hydrothermal system discharges into lake linau and toward the ne, as driven by the hydraulic gradient (brehme et al. 2014).  the fracture network along the area is characterized by strike slip faults and normal faults. the sinistral faults strike n 40° and steeply dip toward the se. left step over on the strike slip faults forms an extension basin in the central study area. normal faults at the extension basin strike nw and dip 70°–80° beneath lake linau (brehme et al. 2014).  lithology  lahendong area is mainly characterized by pre-, postand tondano formation of plioto pleistocene age (koestono et al. 2010). the rocks are typically andesite, volcanic breccia, and tuff. those types have been sampled from borehole cores and used to determine porosity, permeability, and thermal conductivity. effective porosity and matrix permeability have been analyzed using a cylindrical-shaped  specimen with a dimension of 5 cm x 5 cm 9 2.5 cm oriented parallel to the coring (brehme et al. 2016). thermal conductivity has been measured on plain sections of dried cores. the experimental setup consists of a gas permeameter for determining matrix permeability (milsch et al. 2011), of an helium pycnometry for effective porosity measurements (johnson-maynard et al. 1994) and of an optical scanner for thermal conductivity measurements (popov et al. 1999). these parameters have been measured and averaged for the three rock types (brehme et al. 2016;

(2014).  is parallel  it  the numerical  the mesh used for  simulation in feflow consists of 45,264 nodes and 89,320 elements that are denser surrounding the faults because of expected gradients due to parameter contrasts. material properties of  123  elements are permeability, porosity, and thermal conductivity and set according to laboratory measurements (table 1). however, properties of the faults and lake linau are slightly adapted to speciﬁc conditions. the definitions for the modeled grids along the faults are as follows: porosity is 30 % and thermal conductivity is 1.8 w m-1 k-1. corresponding grids for lake linau are deﬁned by a porosity of 100 % and a thermal conductivity of 0.6 w m-1 k-1. the model simulates ﬂuid ﬂow and thermal transport in saturated media in steady state.  initial values and boundary conditions  fluid ﬂow boundary conditions in the model describe groundwater heads and recharge amounts (table 2; fig. 2). the hydraulic head at the sw model boundary is 837 m and 500 m at the ne boundary. the sw hydraulic head represents inﬁltration of surface water into a fault, striking perpendicular to the model. hydraulic head at the ne border is adapted to borehole measurements in that area (brehme et al. 2014). inﬁltration into the fault zones at lake linau is described by ﬂuid ﬂux boundary conditions. the quantity is 3.0 9 10-4 m s-1 the sw and 1.3 9 10-6 m s-1 at the ne fault distributed over 40 m fault width. groundwater recharge is set to 412 mm a-1 at the ne top surface (table 2; fig. 2). fluid movement in  for  \\x0cthe model domain is constrained by no-ﬂow boundary at the bottom, recharge through the surrounding fault zones, and the low hydraulic heads in the ne model area. discharge of the system in the central study area is mainly toward lake linau and across the ne model boundary. initial hydraulic head for the whole model domain is 500 m.  the heat  is 116 °c km-1 at  transport boundary conditions are time-invariant, ﬁxed temperatures, and heat ﬂux (table 2; fig. 2). thermal gradient the sw model boundary, and the temperature is constant 350 °c at the pluton. temperature of water inﬁltrating into faults and here mixing with shallow warm groundwater is 70 °c, while surface groundwater recharge is at 28 °c. temperature values are obtained from ﬁeld and bore log measurements (brehme et al. 2014). heat ﬂux is set to 100 mw m-2 at the bottom model boundary (table 2; fig. 2). this value is ﬁxed based on the studies from delisle et al. (1998), nagao and uyeda (1995), and neben et al. (1998). initial temperature for the model domain is set as 116 °c km-1, according to the local thermal gradient.  permeability determination  initial values for permeability are deﬁned based on laboratory measurements (table 1). after each simulation run, modeled and measured temperature and pressure values have been compared at indicated observation points. in case of poor matching (errors [10 %), permeability has been adjusted until satisfactory results have been achieved. beneath lake linau, simulation results showed locally strong discrepancies between modeled and measured pressure and temperature (errors [45 %). adjustment of permeability in geological inﬁltration rates into faults, or hydraulic heads did not lead to acceptable results. only the implementation of strong permeability anisotropy throughout whole depth, i.e., an additional fault, resulted in minimization of errors (0–7 %). implementation has been accomplished by mesh adaptation to ensure appropriate behavior around the fault. by this procedure, permeability anisotropies have been located and characterized in detail throughout the model.  layers,  in general, deﬁning a direction-dependent permeability improves the data ﬁt rather than using similar permeabilities in all directions. this is probably due to the fractures increasing the permeability mostly in vertical direction.  porosity and thermal conductivity remained constant throughout simulation. variation in porosity is negligible because it would directly be reﬂected in permeability, while thermal conductivity differences would only affect conductive heat transport, which is not dominant in the lahendong area (ondrak et al. 1998; brehme et al. 2014).  123  100c  measurementa  500borelog  ofmodel bottom  boundary

performed to obtain the best ﬁt to the measured data changing the absolute and relative permeability in geological elements. relative permeability refers to different permeabilities in horizontal and vertical direction. as a main result, a blind fault has been recognized beneath lake linau, which has not been known from former studies. simulated pressure and temperature are measured at ﬁve selected observation points, which represent boreholes with available bore logs for pressure and temperature. details on data are given in fig. 6. the model with best data ﬁt, out of 370 different models, is considered to generate the ﬁnal model developed for lahendong.  permeability distribution and identiﬁcation of a blind fault  distribution of permeability patterns in the reservoir has been conceived comparing temperature and pressure data in several wells. especially beneath lake linau, closely located wells show high variations in temperature and pressure. a drop of 100 °c and 18 bar along 300 m distance has been observed between well lhd 24 and lhd 28. models ﬁrst showed high discrepancies between modeled and measured values in this area. however, after implementing another high anisotropic permeable structure between the observation points, models resulted in satisfactory results. the structure has ten times higher vertical  environ earth sci (2016) 75:1088  permeability than horizontal permeability. this structure is assumed to be another fault zone located between two known faults with vertical dip and nw strike. this fault shows no trace at surface, because it is covered by lake linau.  generally, modeled permeability distribution in the lahendong reservoir is direction-dependent and overprints the lithology. modeled permeability is generally higher than measured ones in the order of up to four magnitudes. this is due to fracture patterns, which are not detectable at core-sample scale. permeability patterns directly affect subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow and temperature and pressure distribution.  permeability in the faulted zones and surroundings is lowest in the study area. especially the middle and ne fault, the shallow area beneath sw lake linau and the deep ne section of the ne fault show low permeabilities between 10-13 and 10-14 m2 (fig. 3). the area between the middle and ne fault, the deep section ne of the sw fault, the sw fault itself and the whole model area toward the sw and ne boundary show higher permeabilities of 10-10 and 10-12 m2 (fig. 3).  permeability varies not only within the modeled area, but also in vertical and horizontal direction. in faults and the deep reservoir section in the ne, permeability is by a factor of 10 higher in the vertical direction than in the horizontal direction (fig. 3). in the areas between faults, permeability is in some parts by a factor of 10–100 lower in the vertical direction. in the rest of the model, vertical and horizontal permeability do not differ (fig. 3).  fig. 3 final

suggests that convective heat transport is the dominating process in the reservoir rocks. isotherms generally follow the sw–ne oriented ﬂow pattern, the rise and the inﬁltration of ﬂuids. upwelling of isotherms between the faults veriﬁes water rise toward lake linau. inﬁltration of cold water causes down welling of isotherms particularly on the northeast section of the model. temperature is locally increased at the bottom of the model surrounding the pluton (fig. 4).  subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow  the absolute and horizontal/vertical permeability distribution controls local ﬂuid ﬂow in the lahendong reservoir.  the general ﬂuid ﬂow, driven by the natural pressure gradient, is oriented from sw to ne. vertical inﬁltration occurs at faults at lake linau and at the sw boundary. discharge is across the ne model boundary (fig. 5). the more detailed ﬂow patterns can be observed with streamlines, which show a ﬂuid ﬂow along highly permeable areas. calculated streamlines describe particle ﬂow within the model domain. a forward calculation shows how inﬁltrating water at the sw model boundary distributes through the reservoir. the backward calculation shows the source of ﬂuid particles arriving at the ne model boundary (fig. 5). patterns show that hot groundwater ﬂows toward the faults beneath lake linau, where the ﬂuid ﬂow is disturbed by a rise in temperature and vertically high permeable layers. this causes a rise of groundwater in this model area (red forward streamlines in fig. 5). at the same time, cold water inﬁltrates into high permeable areas and distributes over the ne model domain (blue backward streamlines in fig. 5). it is clearly seen that the composition of the ne reservoir domain is dominated by coldwater inﬁltration into faults, while the production areas are characterized by hot water ﬂow (fig. 5).  discussion  investigation of subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow in geothermal reservoirs is crucial for sustainable exploitation avoiding drilling into less productive areas. subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow might be locally inﬂuenced by fault zones or physical  123  \\x0c1088 page 8 of 11  environ earth sci (2016) 75:1088  fig. 5 model domain with calculated streamlines, in

water (i.e. viscosity). the inﬂuence of these parameters on the ﬂuid ﬂow has been investigated in lahendong geothermal reservoir using hydraulic–thermal simulations. simulation results show the detailed permeability distribution in the reservoir including location of an additional fault zone.  matching of measured and simulated temperature and pressure has been used as a tool for resolving the permeability distribution. temperature and pressure have been iteratively determined at several observation points (fig. 2). generally, modeled values are in good agreement with observed ones (fig. 6). nevertheless, some observation points give slightly different values for both pressure and temperature (lhd 4 and lhd 7) or only temperature (lhd 24). this is probably due to the complicated ﬂow processes or strong small-scale structural variation in fractured and faulted areas. furthermore, density variations, which could have not been included into simulation due to high temperatures, could cause variation of ﬂuid pressure. however, the average deviation of simulated pressure and temperature is 1 %.  implemented model parameters are porosity, permeability, and heat conductivity. from those parameters, only permeability has been tested in a speciﬁc range during simulation. the inﬂuence of porosity and heat conductivity on ﬂuid ﬂow is negligible due to dominating convective heat ﬂow (ondrak et al. 1998). values implemented in the model are based on measured permeabilities, which represent matrix permeability of rocks.  the measured matrix permeability, representing permeability in horizontal direction, is 1.5 9 10-14 m2 on  123  average, which remains within typical permeability range for fractured igneous rocks (scho¨n 2004). permeability for volcanic breccias ranges typically between 3 9 10-15 and 5 9 10-12 m2 and tuff permeabilities range between 7 9 10-17 and 7 9 10-12 m2 (klavetter and peters 1987). in the wairakei geothermal ﬁeld, simulating the impermeable layers resulted in permeabilities of 10-18 and 10-14 m2, in horizontal and vertical axis, respectively (mercer and faust 1979).  however, permeability in reservoir rocks might be locally increased due to fracture formation. it might also be decreased due to alteration and sealing in faults. in lahendong, modeled permeability can be up to four magnitudes higher than measured ones in faulted areas. this is caused by fractures, which are not detectable in core scale. moreover, in fault cores, it is by a factor of 10 higher in vertical direction than in horizontal direction. however, in areas between faults (fault gauge), permeability is in some parts by a factor of 10–100 lower in the vertical direction. adaptation of permeability ensures a ﬁt to measured temperature and pressure data.  permeability in fractured areas is the main factor inﬂuencing subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow and temperature distribution in the lahendong reservoir area. subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow is driven by local hydraulic heads, which show high variations at different sections of the study area. consequently, convective heat distribution leads to high temperature variation along the reservoir. these phenomena are observed in lahendong as well as comparable ﬁelds. in new mexico, water level drops of 30–100 m are observed across (haneberg 1995). high  several  fault  zones  \\x0c123  environ earth sci (2016)

al. (2014)  temperature drops and upwelling of isotherms indicate that fault zones control the ﬂuid ﬂow in the lake long and valentine ﬁelds, usa (hooper 1991). the analysis of ﬂuid pressure differences at the alpine fault, new zealand, allowed to characterize the change in permeability between hanging and footwall blocks (sutherland et al. 2012).  in summary, high pressure or temperature gradients are indicators for ﬂuid barriers between observation points. in other words, reservoir sections of different properties are separated by horizontally less permeable faults. in lahendong, most signiﬁcant ﬂuid barriers are faults to the sw and to the ne of lake linau. across these barriers, the pressure drops up to 20 bars. a similar pattern has been measured in bore logs beneath lake linau, where no surface trace of a fault had been observed in former studies. however, only by implementing another fault, modeled and measured values could have been adapted. the recently identiﬁed fault zone beneath lake linau remains under lake water and therefore is only traceable by this kind of reservoir modeling.  additionally to fault identiﬁcation, the internal structure of known fault zones has been understood in detail. the ne fault, i.e., shows a displacement at 2 km depth. the detailed trend has been understood by permeability adaptation in this area.  due to low permeability in horizontal direction in the faults, ﬂuids propagate mostly vertically toward the hot springs at surface. it also allows surface water to inﬁltrate into the reservoir in case the pressure within the fault zone is low enough (fig. 5). this vertical ﬂuid movement  eventually controls the temperature distribution in the reservoir. upward migration of deep hot water increases the temperature, while inﬁltration of cold surface water causes local drop of temperature.  in summary, the most important factors inﬂuencing the reliability of numerical reservoir models are absolute and different horizontal and vertical permeability. however, a permeability adaptation has been done for each geological layer; the vertical permeability anomalies are overprinting those layers and are constraining the regional groundwater ﬂow. those permeabilities of fractures directly inﬂuence the productivity of the reservoir (cherubini et al. 2013). therefore, their permeability characteristics should be investigated in detail.  in a previous study, a numerical model for the lahendong site has been set up in tough2 and aimed at forecasting the reservoir behavior during exploitation until the year 2036. with a production of 60 mwe, it predicts a pressure drop of 10 bars. however, the forecast results are uncertain due to lack of measured pressure draw down data (yani 2006). accordingly, the next steps of the presented study should include a realistic production and injection scenario in order reservoir exploitation. furthermore, chemical characteristics could be considered to achieve reliable production setups, because hydrochemical processes play an important role in the lahendong reservoir (brehme et al. 2016). presented models from this study provide important information on ﬂuid ﬂow in the water-dominated lahendong reservoir. however, additional the  two-phase ﬂow models of  to support  sustainable  \\x0c1088 page 10 of 11  environ earth sci (2016) 75:1088  lahendong area are in progress to understand the inﬂuence of steam driven ﬂuid ﬂow in this high-temperature system.  conclusion  the primary focus of this study is to understand the inﬂuence of fault zones and permeability patterns on subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow in geothermal reservoirs. the ﬂuid ﬂow mainly depends on rock and fault zone permeability. these processes have been considered in numerical models, which simulate local temperature and pressure conditions. the initial reservoir conditions, which refers to the case before production starts. models are developed based on the conceptual models of the study area, which explain reservoir geometry, geological structures, temperature, and hydraulic conditions. temperature and pressure well-logs have been used for model calibration.  the numerical

pressure signiﬁcantly drop across that ﬂuid barrier. this behavior has been observed in comparable ﬁelds in the usa as well. the overall shape of ﬂuid ﬂow direction trends in a sw–ne direction. main recharge occurs by inﬁltration of surface water into the faults, especially in the southwest and near to lake linau. discharge is enhanced in highly fractured areas toward lake linau. vertical permeability of faults allows ﬂuids rising toward the hot springs at surface.  results show that permeability has to be considered for simulation of a geothermal system. the geothermal system is mainly controlled by ﬂuid ﬂow in fractures/faults depending on temperature and pressure conditions. the locally modiﬁed ﬂuid ﬂow can considerably inﬂuence the productivity of a geothermal ﬁeld. results also guide reservoir management in case of a potential for ﬁeld extension, as performed in lahendong.  acknowledgments the authors acknowledge the continuous support within the team of the

keywords: geothermal  energy granite high  temperature stress-strain  response triaxial acoustic xrd  geothermal   heat   has   now   been   identiﬁed   as   an   effective   renewable   energy   source   due   to  severe   environmental   impacts   created   by   conventional   fossil   usage   on  global   climatic   change.   however,   its  wide application   has   been   limited   due   to   the   lack   of   knowledge,   particularly   of   the   geothermal   conditions   of reservoir   rocks   at   elevated   temperatures   and   pressures.   such   high   temperatures   and   pressures   possibly alter   the  mechanical   properties   of  reservoir   rocks   due   to   the   associated   micro-structural   and   mineralogical  alterations   of   the   rock   mass,   which   are   an   important   attribute   for   wellbore   stability   and   stimulation   of geothermal   reservoirs   for   safe  and   effective   geothermal   energy   extraction.   this   study   therefore   investigates   the   stress-strain   behaviour   under   in-situ   stress   and   temperature   conditions   by   conducting   a  series of  high-pressure,   high-temperature   tri-axial   experiments   on  australian   strathbogie   granite   under   four different  conﬁning   pressures   (10,   30,   60,   90   mpa)   and   four   different   temperatures   (rt,   100,   200,   300 ◦c). the  effect   of  temperature   on   the   mechanical   behaviour   of   rock   specimens   was   studied   under   tri-axial   conditions   and   the   corresponding   fracture   propagation   behaviour   was   observed   using   an   advanced   acoustic emission   (ae)   system.   the   corresponding   micro-structure   alteration   in   granite   was   observed   using   sem analysis.   according   to   the   ﬁndings,   increasing   temperature   leads   to  an   initial   increment   in   reservoir rock   strength   and   shear   parameters   followed   by   reduction,   and   the   trend   is   aligned   with   the   crack  formation   pattern   of   the  rock   mass.   this   was   further   conﬁrmed   by   the   sem   analysis,   according   to  which the   rock   micro-structure   is   subject   to  only   minor   changes   at   relatively   low   temperatures   and  higher temperatures   cause   micro-cracks   to   develop   along   the   rock   mass   grain   boundaries.   furthermore,   the conventional   mohr-coulomb   criteria   failed   to   model   the  stress-strain   response   of   rock   under   geothermal reservoir   conditions,   and   was   therefore   modiﬁed   for   the   corresponding   in-situ   conditions.  ©   2016   elsevier   ltd.   all   rights   reserved.  1.  introduction  geothermal  heat  has  been  identiﬁed  as  a

found  to  have  adequate  temperatures  to  serve  as  a geothermal  reservoirs  (fox  et  al.,  2013).  such  explorations  involve ﬁnding  vast  blocks  of  “hot  rocks”  with  fracture  systems.  such  rocks can  be  used  to  generate  electricity.  in  this  process,  water  is  ﬁrst injected  and  circulated  through  the  fractures  in  the  geothermal reservoirs  and  eventually  pumped  back  to  the  surface  as  steam. however,  the  exploration  of  geothermal  resources  has  become  a challenge  to  engineers  and  geologists,  due  to  the  high  temperature and  stress  environments  in  geothermal  reservoirs.  for  this  reason, laboratory  experiments  conducted  under  high  pressure  and  temperature  conditions  (geothermal  conditions)  can  assist  in  providing  \\x0cw.g.p.  kumari  et  al.  /  geothermics  65  (2017)  44–59   45  basic  predictions.  a  large  number  of  laboratory  experiments  has therefore  been  conducted  since  1970  to  investigate  the  inﬂuence of  high  pressure  and  temperature  on  rock  in  relation  to  geothermal heat  extraction  (siratovich  et  al.,  2016),  deep  geological  disposal  of nuclear  waste  (paquet  and  franc¸  ois,  1980),  deep  mining  (wawersik and  hannum,  1980)  and  geological  co2 storage  (dai  et  al.,  2014). the  mechanical  behaviour  of  reservoir  rocks  is  signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced  by  elevated  temperatures,  because  they  cause  the micro-structure  of  the  rock  mass  to  be  altered  through  thermal   expansion,  the  development  of  new  micro-cracks,  extending and/or  widening  the  existing  micro cracks  and  various  mineralogical  alterations.  rock  strength-deformation  criteria  change with  temperature,  and  some  rock  mechanical  properties,  such  as compressive  strength,  tensile  strength,  elastic  modulus,  cohesive strength  and  friction  angle,  decrease  with  increasing  temperature (heuze,  1983;  dwivedi  et  al.,  2008).  however,  such  alterations  are also  affected  by  the  conﬁnement  applying  on  the  rock  mass,  and conﬁning  pressure  causes  the  suppression  of  thermal  cracks  and the  extension/widening  of  existing  micro-cracks.  this  results  in further  alteration  of  the  rock  mass  mechanical  properties,  resulting  in  changing  failure  modes  (mogi,  1966).  studies  have  identiﬁed the  transition  of  rock  failure  mode  from  brittle  to  ductile  with increasing  conﬁnement.  however,  this  transition  is  diverse  due  to the  different  mineralogical  compositions  and  grain  boundaries  in different  rocks  (klein  et  al.,  2001;  wong,  1982).  although  many  studies  have  been  conducted  to  investigate  the temperature-dependent  mechanical  behaviour  of  reservoir  rocks, most  experiments  have  been  conducted  in  unconﬁned  environments  (singh  et  al.,  2015;  shao  et  al.,  2014).  pre-heating  the specimens  to  the  corresponding  temperature  ranges  and  testing  at  room  temperatures  has  been  frequently  done  (bauer  and johnson,  1979;  xu  et  al.,  2008),  but  the  method  is  not  reliable, as  geothermal  reservoirs  experience  continuous  thermal  stresses. such  limitations  have  occurred  mainly  due  to  the  limited  number  of appropriate  test  facilities  available  to  simulate  the  stress  and  temperature  conditions  of  actual  geothermal  reservoirs.  although  some studies  have  analytically  and  numerically  evaluated  the  mechanical properties  of  rocks  under  high  temperatures  and  pressures  (chester and  higgs,  1992;  tian  et  al.,  2013;  vásárhelyi  et  al.,  2016),  to  date none  has  captured  the  stress-strain  behaviour  and  failure  criteria  of rocks  over  a  wide  range  of  conﬁning  pressures  and  temperatures, particularly  for  australian  granite.  however,  the  thermo-elastic response  and  appropriate  failure  criteria  are  essential  inputs  for many  engineering  applications  under  high  pressures  and  temperatures,  including  geothermal  extraction  applications.  this  study therefore  intends  to  ﬁll  this  gap,  and  it  is  hoped  it  will  make  an important  contribution  to  many  deep  underground  applications.  2.  methodology  2.1.  tested  material  granite  is  an  abundant  crystalline  rock  in  the  earth  with  medium to  coarse  grains  which  was  formed  as  a  result  of  the  slow  cooling of  magma.  granite  therefore  has  abundant  radioactive  elements (k,  th,  and  u).  such  elements  bring  elevated  geothermal  gradients to  deep  granite  reservoirs,  which  therefore  have  ideal  conditions as  geothermal  reservoirs.  the  mineralogical  composition  of  granite  mainly  consists  of  quartz,  feldspar,  plagioclase  and  biotite,  and small  amounts  of  muscovite,  amphibole,  hornblende  and  opaque (dwivedi  et  al.,  2008).  for  the  present  study,  samples  were  collected  from  the  strathbogie  batholith,  which  is  a  composite  granitoid  intrusion  body spreading  over  more  than  1500  km2 in  150  km  north-east  from melbourne  (fig.  1).  strathbogie  granite  is  a  high-level,  discordant  fig.  1.  sampling  location  of  strathbogie  batholith  in  central  victoria.  table  1 physical,  mechanical  and

be  observed  in  the  granite  specimen,  mainly  with quartz,  k-feldspar  and  plagioclase.  as  shown  in  fig.  3,  the  grain  size was  measured  from  a  thin  section  of  this  granite  and  found  to  be \\u242em  with  only  a  small  number mainly  in  the  range  of  0  mm–200  of  larger  grains  (>300  mm)   (shao  et  al.,  2014).  table  1  summarizes the  physical,  mechanical  and  petrographic  properties  of  the  tested strathbogie  granite.  in  addition,  an  xrd  analysis  was  conducted  to determine  the  mineralogical  composition  of  the  selected  granite and  the  result  is  shown  in  table  2.  as  the  table  shows,  quartz  is the  predominant  mineral  in  the  selected  granite  (50%),  followed  by 16%  of  sodic  and  intermediate  biotite  and  15%  of  plagioclase.  the mineralogical  composition  of  this  particular  granitic  composition is  representative  of  the  composition  of  the  majority  of  the  earth’s granites  (best,  1995).  all  the  physical  properties  in  tables  1  and  2  \\x0c46   w.g.p.  kumari  et  al.  /  geothermics  65  (2017)  44–59  fig.  2.

in  the  laboratory:  xrd analysis  (mineral  composition),  uniaxial  compression  testing  (compressive  strength,  elastic  modulus),  thin  section  analysis  (average grain  size),  mercury  intrusion  testing  (porosity)  and  volume  and weight  measurement  (bulk  density).  2.2.  sample  preparation  sample  preparation  and  testing  were  carried  out  at  the  deep earth  energy  research  laboratory  (deerl)  in  the  civil  engineering  department  of  monash  university,  and  the  sample  preparation was  conducted  in  accordance  with  the  astm  standard  for  tri-axial compressive  testing  (astm  d7012-10  (2010)).  in  order  to  maintain consistency,  all  the  samples  were  cored  to  22.5  mm  in  diameter using  the  same  block  of  granite  at  the  same  orientation.  during  the sampling  great  care  was  taken  to  obtain  samples  with  the  same crystalline  orientation,  and  samples  with  different  crystalline  orientation,  internal  layers  and  visible  cracks  were  discarded.  it  should be  noted  that  coring-induced  rock-microstructure  alteration  is  an important  aspect  to  consider  in  laboratory  experiments,  although few  studies  have  considered  this  effect.  to  avoid  such  issues,  a  very small  coring  rate  was  adopted  and  water  was  used  as  a  lubricant. the  cored  specimens  were  then  cut  into  45  mm  high  cylinders  and both  ends  of  the  specimens  were  ground  to  produce  two  parallel surfaces  perpendicular  to  the  axes  of  the  cylindrical  specimens.  2.3.  experimental  procedure  tri-axial  experiments  were  conducted  on  samples  under  four different  conﬁning  pressures  (10,  30,  60  and  90  mpa)  and  four different  temperatures  (rt,  100,  200,  300 ◦c).  these  experimental  conditions  were  selected,  because  the  most  preferable  hot  dry rock  systems  are  generally  located  at  depths  of  2.5–3.5  km  and have  around  70  mpa–120  mpa   conﬁning  pressures  (assuming  the reservoir  rock  density  is  equal  to  2500  kg/m3)  and  temperatures  of  200–350 ◦c  (breede  et  al.,  2013).  the  different  conﬁning  pressures and  temperatures  were  selected  to  simulate  the  reservoir  depth effect  and  to  obtain  a  sufﬁcient  data  set  to  understand  the  failure criteria  under  different  temperatures.  the  complete  arrangement  of  the  tri-axial  cell  is  shown  in fig.  3.  the  prepared  sample  was  ﬁrst  placed  inside  the  cell  and  the required  conﬁning  pressure  was   then  applied  using  a  silicon  oil  system,  and  an  annealed  copper  sleeve  was  used  to  isolate  the  sample from  the  conﬁning  liquid  (refer  to  fig.  3(b).  a  mica-insulated  metal band  heater  was   used  to  heat  the  pressure  cell  and  consequently the  rock  sample.  the  temperatures  of  the  cell  were  adjusted  using  a controller  and  a  constant  small  heating  rate  of  2.5 ◦c/min  was  used to  prevent  micro-structural  damage  due  to  sudden  thermal  shocks. two  separate  thermocouples  were  used  to  achieve  precise  temperature  control,  and  the  reading  of  the  thermocouple  installed  inside the  cell  (fig.  3(b))  was   recorded  by  the  data  acquisition  system.  the other  thermocouple  that  was   attached  to  the  barrel  (fig.  3(a))  was used  to  control  the  band  heater.  furthermore,  the  barrel  and  the top  of  the  pressure  cell  were  covered  using  an  insulating  blanket to  reduce  heat  loss  during  the  experiments  and  to  minimise  the inﬂuence  of  air  ﬂows  towards  the  cell.  all  the  tests  were  started once  the  system  had  achieved  a  steady  state  to  ensure  uniformity in  temperature  and  pressure  across  the  sample.  equilibrium  was ensured  by  monitoring  the  conﬁnement  pump  volume  and  the thermocouple  readings  inside  the  cell  (located  very  close  to  the specimen).  under  steady-state  conditions,  constant  pump  volume and  constant  temperature  were  observed  and  testing  was   initiated. a   constant  loading  pump  ﬂow  rate  of  1  ml/min  was  adopted  for all  the  test  specimens  and  the  converted  displacement  rate  was 0.05  mm/min.  it  should  be  noted  that  a  small  shaft  resistance  exists as  a  result  of  the  sealing  of  the  hydraulic  cylinder,  and  this  effect was  considered  in  the  calibration  of  the  loading  cell.  the  sealing resistance  was  obtained  by  measuring  the  pump  pressure  to  initiate  a  movement  in  the  loading  shaft,  and  this  was   deducted  from each  pressure  reading  to  eliminate  the  resistance  of  the  sealing  dur\\x0cw.g.p.  kumari  et  al.  /  geothermics  65  (2017)  44–59   47  using  the  typical  mohr-coulomb  brittle  deformation.  the  deviatoric stress-strain  plots  of  the  granite  samples  (fig.  4)  exhibited  concave upward  curvilinear  trends  from  initial  loading  to  the  peak  value, beyond  which  strain  softening  occurred,  causing  a  rapid  stress  drop to  a  residual  value.  increasing  peak  stress  with  increasing  conﬁning  pressure  can  be  observed,  which  is  to  be  expected,  according to  typical  mohr-coulomb  type  brittle  failure  (paterson  and  wong, 2005).  traditionally,  rock  failure  in  compression  can  occur  in  two main  ways;  (a)  dilatancy  and  failure  by  strain  softening  under relatively  low  conﬁning  pressures  and  (b)  failure  by  strain  hardening  under  elevated  conﬁning  pressures,  and  a  transitional  regime may   be  observed  at  intermediate  pressures.  these  transitional  failure  modes  have  been  referred  to  as  “quasi-brittle”,  and  complex localized  features  such  as  conjugate  shear  bands  can  be  observed under  such  conditions  (klein  et  al.,  2001;  gajo  et  al.,  2004).  by visual  inspection  of  the  post-failure  samples,  important  information  about  the  alteration  of  the  granite  failure  mechanism  with conﬁning  pressures  and  temperatures  can  be  identiﬁed.  postfailure  images  (fig.  5)  were  therefore  collected  after  each  test.  according  to  the  post-failure  images,  specimens  that  failed at  10–60  mpa   conﬁning  pressures  mainly  failed  by  shear  localization  along  an  inclined  macroscopic  shear  band  with  a  single shear  zone  across  each  sample.  however,  samples  tested  at  higher conﬁnements  of  90  mpa   and  120  mpa   (at  100 ◦c)  exhibited  strain hardening  characteristics  after  achieving  the  peak  stress,  and  several  conjugate  shear  bands  could  be  observed  on  the  cylindrical sample  surface,  instead  of  the  single  shear  band  observed  earlier. this  characteristic  was  signiﬁcant  at  120  mpa   conﬁning  pressure. however,  it  should  be  noted  that  only  one  test  was   conducted at  120  mpa   conﬁnement,  because  at  such  high  conﬁning  pressures  the  corresponding  failure  load  of  granite  exceeds  the  bottom pedestal’s  load-bearing  capacity.  further,  a  progressive  reduction was  observed  in  the  failure  plane  angle  with  respect  to  the  minor principal  stress  direction  with  increasing  conﬁning  pressure,  which implies  a  reduction  in  friction  angle,  possibly  due  to  the  greater quasi-brittle  behaviour  that  was   shown  by  granite  samples  at higher  conﬁning  pressures  (wong  et  al.,  2001).  3.2.  effect  of  temperature  and  conﬁning  pressure  on  mechanical properties  of  strathbogie  granite  fig.  6  illustrates  the  inﬂuence  of  temperature  on  the  deviatoric stress  of  the  tested  granite  under  each  conﬁnement.  as  the  ﬁgure  shows,  the  inﬂuence  of  conﬁnement  is  more  signiﬁcant  than that  of  temperature  in  the  temperature  range  considered  here. wong  and  brace  (1979)  conﬁrm  that  at  lower  conﬁning  pressures considerable  thermal  cracking  occurs  at  relatively  low  temperatures.  if  thermal  cracking  is  responsible  for  the  reduction  in  failure strength,  a  sharp  reduction  in  deviatoric  stress  with  increasing temperature  (with  suppression  of  thermal  cracks)  should  be  exhibited  under  unconﬁned  pressure  condition.  however,  based  on  the experimental  results,  under  unconﬁned  conditions,  up  to  100 ◦c, 17.6%  of  increment  in  deviatoric  stress  is  followed  by  2.5%  and 10.5%  reductions  at  200 ◦c  and  300 ◦c,  respectively.  however,  when conﬁnement  was  applied,  strength  reduction  was  initiated  after   higher  temperature  of  200 ◦c,  mainly  due  to  the  inhibition  of a thermal  cracks  by  induced  compressive  force.  thermal  cracking  is therefore  an  important  strength  property  alteration  mechanism  in reservoir  rocks  under  certain  conﬁning  pressure  conditions.  a    clear  inﬂuence  of  temperature  on  deviatoric  stress  at  any depth  or  conﬁnement  can  be  observed,  and  increasing  the  temperature  from  room  temperature  to  200 ◦c  causes  an  increment  in deviatoric  stress,  and  further  increasing  of  temperature  to  300 ◦c causes  a  slight  reduction  in  it.  this  is  because  the  thermal  expansion which  occurs  with  increasing  temperature  causes  the  reduction

resistance  is  negligible  which  is  only  0.19% of  maximum  measurement.  during  the  load  application,  the  axial strain  was  measured  using  linear  variable  differential  transducers (lvdts)  attached  to  the  ram  of  the  load  cell  (fig.  3(a)).  an  acoustic  emission  (ae)  system  was  also  employed  in  the  testing  of  samples  to  record  the  data  related  to  the  fracturing  process. the  ae  system  adopted  was  a  peripheral  component  interconnection  (pci)  system  with  a  nominal  resolution  frequency  of  500  khz. during  the  experiments,  two  sensors  were  attached  to  either  side  of the  loading  shaft  and  with  the  external  ampliﬁers,  which  generated low  frequency  acoustic  waves  with  the  fracturing  of  the  sample.  in addition,  possible  micro-structural  and  mineralogical  changes  that occurred  during  thermal  and  conﬁnement  effects  were  checked using  sem  analyses.  3.  results  and  discussion  3.1.

pressure.  the  reductions  of  strength  characteristics  were relatively  small  up  to  500 ◦c  and  beyond  that  an  accelerated  downward  trend  was  identiﬁed.  furthermore,  wider  localized  zones were  observed  at  high  temperatures  in  the  post-failure  images. however,  these  studies  were  conducted  at  wider  temperature ranges  (up  to  700 ◦c  and  900 ◦c,  respectively)  and  the  researchers therefore  did  not  pay  close  attention  to  reservoir  rock  behaviour under  relatively  low  geothermal  temperature  ranges  (<300 ◦c).  this was  the  focus  of  the  present  study,  according  to  which  there  is an  initial  strengthening  and  stiffening  in  granite  with  increasing temperature  at  low  temperatures  (up  to  200 ◦c),  and  increasing the  temperature  beyond  a  certain  value  causes  a  gradual  reduction  in  failure  stress  with  increasing  temperature.  elastic  modulus is  an  important  mechanical  property  of  any  reservoir  rock,  and  describes  the  brittle  characteristics  of  the  rock  mass.  it  is  therefore often  used  to  evaluate  many  in-situ  stress  applications,  including wellbore  stability,  fracturing  possibility  and  tectonic  stress  distribution  (heard  and  page,  1982).  the  temperature-dependent  brittle properties  (elastic  modulus)  of  the  tested  granite  were  then  evaluated.  the  elastic  region  of  each  stress-strain  curve  was  used  to calculate  the  temperature and  pressure-dependent  young’s  moduli  (e)  and  the  results  are  shown  in  fig.  7.  the  axial  strain  was measured  using  lvdts  attached  to  the  loading  ram  with  a  linearity ±0.1%  f.s  (full  scale)  (±0.0075  mm)   and  inﬁnite  resoluerror  of  tion  (no  hysteresis).  an  increment  of  the  modulus  of  strathbogie granite  with  increasing  temperature  up  to  200 ◦c  can  be  observed, and  further  increase  of  temperature  (to  300 ◦c)  causes  the  elastic modulus  to  be  slightly  reduced  for  any  conﬁnement.  this  trend  is  \\x0ca  ‘brittle’  or     general  increment  in  elastic  modulus  with  increasing  conﬁnement  can  be  observed  until  90  mpa,  and  a  further  increase of  conﬁnement  (to  120  mpa)  reduces  the  young’s  modulus  considerably.  with  increasing  conﬁning  stress  additional  plastic deformation  occurs,  exhibiting  strain-hardening  characteristics  in granite  under  high  conﬁnements.  however,  within  the  range  of the  experiments  conducted  (10  mpa–120  mpa)  it  cannot  be  deﬁnitively  identiﬁed  as  a  ’ductile’  regime.  however,  the strain-hardening  behaviour  observed  at  120  mpa   indicates  transitional  characteristics  and  this  can  be  identiﬁed  as  ‘quasi-brittle’ behaviour  (klein  et  al.,  2001).  the  initial  young’s  modulus  reduction  with  increasing  conﬁnement  was  observed  by  heard  and  page (1982),  who   conducted  tests  up  to  55  mpa   conﬁning  pressure.  however,  the  latter  behaviour  was  not  observed  by  these  researchers. interestingly,  according  to  the  research  literature,  at  low  temperatures  (<200 ◦c)  some  granite  types  are  more  temperature-sensitive, while  in  contrast,  some  granites  are  more  temperature-sensitive at  high  temperatures.  the  initial  strength  enhancement  is  more signiﬁcant  for  coarse-grained  granites  and  granodiorite  than  for ﬁne-grained  granites.  for  example,  according  to  heard  and  page (1982),  stripa  granite  is  more  sensitive  to  temperature  at  relatively  low  temperatures  (<200 ◦c),  and  westerly  granite  is  more sensitive  to  temperature  at  high  temperatures  (>200 ◦c).  such  contradictory  behaviours  may   occur  in  granite  due  to  the  different grain  size  distributions,  grain  orientations,  mineralogical  compositions  and  heterogeneity  of  different  granite  types.  this  indicates  the importance  of  studying  the  mineralogical  composition  and  microstructural  inﬂuence  of  granites  on  such  on  temperature-dependent strength  variations.  3.3.  effect  of  temperature  on  shear  strength  parameters  of strathbogie  granite  fig.  8  illustrates  the  variation  of  deviatoric  stress  of  the  tested granite  with  conﬁning  pressure  for  each  temperature.  the  ﬁgure shows  that  increasing  conﬁnement  causes  the  granite’s  deviatoric stress  to  increase  non-linearly  and  gradually  come  to  a  steady  state. this  is  consistent  with  similar  previous  studies,  which  have  clearly shown  the  enhancement  of  rock  strength  with  increasing  conﬁnement,  and  the  increasing  rate  is  reduced  with  increasing  conﬁning pressure  (barton,  2013;  singh  et  al.,  2011).  this  is  because  at  low conﬁning  pressures  there  is  a  high  dilation  potential.  therefore,  the ability  to  open  rock  micro-cracks  is  high,  resulting  in  higher  friction  angles.  however,  this  dilation  potential  and  the  corresponding tendency  for  micro-cracks  to  open  are  suppressed  with  increasing conﬁnement,  resulting  in  lower  friction  angles  at  higher  conﬁning  pressures.  therefore,  the  failure  mechanism  of  the  rocks  shifts from  brittle  to  ductile  with  increasing  conﬁnement,  changing  the shape  of  the  mohr-coulomb  failure  envelope,  and  according  to barton  (1976),  at  critical  conﬁning  pressure  the  mohr-coulomb  failure  envelope  reaches  a  zero  gradient.  this  has  also  been  shown by  hoek  (1983).  the  present  study  has  clearly  identiﬁed  this  rock behaviour  in  the  mohr-coulomb  failure  envelopes  developed  for each  temperature  condition  (refer  to  fig.  9).  according  to  fig.  9, the  traditional  linear  mohr-coulomb  criteria  are  applicable  only  in the  brittle  region  of  the  failure  envelope,  and  at  higher  conﬁnew.g.p.  kumari  et  al.  /  geothermics  65  (2017)  44–59  consistent  with  the  temperature-dependent  strength  behaviour  of the  granite  described  above.  the  reason  for  the  initial  elastic  module  increment  may  be  that  the  specimen  becomes  more  brittle  at the  initial  temperature  ranges  due  to  thermally-induced  volumetric  expansion  and  the  associated  pore  volume  reduction.  the  later slight  reduction  of  young’s  modulus  with  increasing  temperature exhibits  an  enhancement  in  ductile  behaviour  (quasi-brittle  characteristics)  with  further  increase  of  temperature.  this  is  possibly due  to  the  increased  crack  density  caused  by  the  induced  thermal crack  development  and  the  related  weakening  of  the  granite.  600  500

weakening  of  the  grain  boundaries,  dependent  on the  anisotropy  of  the  rock  matrix  (due  to  potentially  existing  distinct  mineral  compounds  in  granite  those  may   contain  different thermo-elastic  moduli  and  this  may   causes  to  generate  different  internal  stresses  with  heating).  according  to  wong  and  brace (1979),  increasing  the  temperature  causes  the  induction  of  thermal cracks  in  the  rock  mass  due  to  the  associated  generation  of  internal stresses  (eq.  (2)):  (2)  e(cid:4)˛(cid:4)t   =   \\u2434     where,  e,  \\x01␣,   \\x01t   is  the  matrix  young’s  modulus,  difference  of thermal  expansion  coefﬁcient  of  distinct  mineral  and  temperature difference,  respectively.  when  the  internal  stress  (given  by  eq.  (2)) exceeds  the  crack  closure  pressure  with  increasing  temperature, thermal  cracks  form  and  further  increase  of  temperature  provides the  surface  energy  required  for  the  propagation  of  the  initiated crack  (zuo  et  al.,  2007).  this  results  in  alteration  of  the  grain-tograin  contacts  in  the  rock  matrix,  which  leads  to  reduced  cohesion at  higher  temperatures.  in  the  case  of  the  variation  of  friction  angle with  increasing  temperature,  the  granite  friction  angle  appears  to remain  steady  up  to  around  100 ◦c  (52◦)  and  then  slightly  increases with  increasing  temperature  (54◦ at  200  and  300 ◦ c,  respectively). the  friction  between  grain-to-grain  contacts  may  be  altered  by the  thermally-induced  micro-structural  modiﬁcations.  however, this  effect  on  grain  contact  is  expected  to  be  smaller  at  relatively low  temperatures,  resulting  in  relatively  steady  friction  angle  with increasing  temperature  at  lower  temperatures.  however,  a  slight  ments  non-linearity  must  be  taken  into  account.  in  addition  to  the conﬁnement,  according  to  this  study,  increasing  temperature  also alters  the  failure  envelope  of  granite.  an  initial  increment  in  deviatoric  stress  with  increasing  temperature  can  be  observed  up  to 200 ◦c  and  further  increase  of  temperature  (to  300 ◦c)  causes  it  to be  slightly  reduced.  the  temperature-dependent  shear  parameters  of  granite  were investigated  next,  and  the  shear  parameters  can  be  obtained from  the  mohr-coulomb  failure  envelope.  as  suggested  by  singh et  al.  (2011),  the  mohr-coulomb  parameters  (cohesion  and  friction  angle)  were  calculated  using  eq.  (1),  taking  into  account  the linear  region  of  the  obtained  mohr-coulomb  failure  envelope  (considering  only  smaller  conﬁning  stresses,  up  to  30  mpa)  for  each temperature  condition  to  obtain  the  temperature-dependent  shear strength  parameters  (fig.  10).

(continued)  enhancement  in  friction  angle  with  increasing  temperature  can  be seen,  probably  due  to  the  increased  resistance  of  mineral  particles to  external  deformation  as  a  result  of  the  thermally-induced  energy in  the  mineral  particles.  however,  compared  with  cohesion,  the temperature  dependency  on  friction  angle  is  relatively  insigniﬁcant within  the  temperature  region  considered  here.  initial  enhancement  in  shear  parameters  in  sandstone  with increasing  temperature  has  been  observed  by  zhang  et  al.  (2015)  at relatively  low  temperature  regions,  and  these  researchers  observed   reduction  in  friction  angle  from  33.02◦ to  31.93◦ and  an  increment a in  cohesion  from  61.47  mpa   to  66.44  mpa   with  increasing  temperature  from  25 ◦c  to  100 ◦c.  further,  bauer  and  johnson  (1979) observed  around  10%  reduction  in  cohesion  and  40%  reduction  in friction  angle  in  westerly  granite  with  increasing  temperature  from room  temperature  to  300 ◦c,  and  friedman  et  al.  (1979)  observed   7%  reduction  in  cohesion  and  a  38%  reduction  in  friction  angle a with  increasing  temperature  from  room  temperature  to  400 ◦c and  300 ◦c,  respectively.  however,  the  variation  of  shear  strength parameters  with  increasing  temperature  at  relatively  low  temperatures  (<300 ◦c)  was  not  considered  in  the  above  studies.  the observed  initial  shear  strengthening  may   be  due  to  the  inhibition  of micro-crack  propagation  by  the  plasticity  mechanism  which  occurs at  crack  tips  (duclos  and  paquet  (1991))  at  low  temperatures.  with further  increment  of  temperature,  the  reduction  of  shear  strength parameters  can  be  expected,  due  to  the  thermal  weakening  of  the rock  micro-structure.  furthermore,  according  to  the  sem  studies conducted  by  zuo  et  al.  (2007),  large  local  plastic  deformations  and extremely  rough  cleavage  fractures  occur  at  relatively  low  temperatures.  moreover,  due  to  the  volume  expansion,  the  distance between  the  interfaces  of  the  individual  minerals  decreases  with the  enhancement  of  their  mutual  attraction,  and  the  strength  of the  bonds  increases  (dmitriev,  1972).  both  of  these  phenomena  can  be  considered  to  explain  the  stress  strengthening  of  granite  under relatively  low  temperatures  when  subjected  to  conﬁning  pressures.  3.4.  analysis  of  fracturing  behaviour  using  ae  technology  acoustic  emission  (ae)  detection  technology  is  a  powerful  nondestructive  tool  to  study  crack  propagation  processes  in  brittle materials,  including  the  stages  of  crack  initiation,  growth  and  crack damage  (lockner,  1993).  when  a  brittle  material  is  under  stress, strain  energy  is  released  during  the  development  of  new  cracks  or the  widening  of  existing  cracks.  this  energy  is  released  in  the  form of  elastic  stress  waves  from  the  crack  tips,  and  can  be  captured  and ampliﬁed  by  an  ae  system.  ae  detection  technology  has  therefore been  widely  used  in  a  number  of  previous  studies  to  understand the  crack  development  mechanism  in  brittle  materials  (chang  and lee,  2004;  lei  et  al.,  2000;  moura  et  al.,  2005).  by  incorporating  the  crack  propagation  pattern  into  the  stressstrain  relationship  of  the  cracking  material,  the  crack  development process  can  be  divided  into  several  stages.  hoek  and  bieniawski (1965)  divided  crack  formation  into  ﬁve  main  stages:  crack  closure,  crack  initiation,  secondary  cracking,  crack  coalescence  and crack  damage.  later,  ranjith  et  al.

(2015) incorporated  stress-strain  curves  into  cumulative  ae  counts/energy and  strain  plots.  in  the  crack  propagation  process,  with  the  gradual increment  of  loading  on  brittle  materials,  most  pre-existing  cracks are  ﬁrst  closed,  releasing  an  insigniﬁcant  number  of  ae  counts. this  initial  crack  closure  period  is  followed  by  the  stable  crack propagation  period,  which  can  be  identiﬁed  by  the  release  of  gradual  ae  energy  increments.  further  increment  of  loading  causes  an exponential  increase  in  ae  energy,  indicating  an  unstable  crack propagation  period  with  failure  approaching.  the  crack  closure threshold  ((cid:2)cc)  is  deﬁned  as  the  stress  threshold  at  which  the  initial ae  counts  are  identiﬁed.  anan  initial  increment  in  cumulative  ae  \\x0c54   w.g.p.  kumari  et  al.  /  geothermics  65  (2017)  44–59  counts  can  be  seen  at  the  crack  initiation  ((cid:2)ci)  threshold,  and  the cumulative  ae  counts  starts  exponential  growth  at  the  crack  damage  ((cid:2)cd)  threshold.  the  region  between  the  crack  closure  threshold and  the  crack  initiation  threshold  is  generally  deﬁned  as  the  stable crack  closure  region,  where  linear  elastic  deformation  occurs.  the region  between  the  crack  initiation  threshold  and  the  crack  damage  threshold  is  deﬁned  as  the  stable  crack  propagation  region,  and the  region  between  the  crack  damage  threshold  and  sample  failure is  identiﬁed  as  the  unstable  crack  propagation  region.  the  application  of  compressive  loading  fails  rocks  through  either shear  localization  (brittle  regime)  or  cataclastic  ﬂow,  and  the  surrounding  conditions,  such  as  temperatures  and  pressures,  may cause  a  homogenous  plastic  ﬂow.  according  to  existing  studies, axial  intra-granular  cracking  and  shear  rupturing  of  cemented  grain contacts  can  be  observed  before  failure  in  brittle  regimes,  and  grain crushing  and  pore  collapse  can  be  identiﬁed  before  failure  in  cataclastic  ﬂow  regimes  (menéndez  et  al.,  1996).  according  to  wong et  al.  (1997),  the  development  of  local  stress  concentrations  leads to  the  initiation  of  many  intra-granular  micro-cracks  in  the  rock mass,  and  the  crack  density  increases  with  increasing  deviatoric stress  and  tends  to  merge  on  reaching  the  peak  stress,  resulting  in strain  softening  and  shear  localization.  these  damage  processes  are clearly  identiﬁed  by  the  intense  ae  activities  in  the  ﬁeld  (chang  and lee,  2004).  ae  technology  was  therefore  used  to  investigate  the  progressive  fracturing  behaviour  in  strathbogie  granite  under  tri-axial conditions.  fig.  11  illustrates  the  cumulative  ae  events  with  axial stress  at  various  pressures  and  temperatures  for  the  tested  specimens.  the  corresponding  variations  of  deviatoric  stress  against strain  are  also  included  in  the  same  plots  to  identify  the  stress thresholds  for  crack  closure,  crack  initiation  and  crack  damage (table  4).  the  very  high  ae  counts  in  strathbogie  granite  at  dilatancy in  the  pre-failure  stage  are  due  to  the  fact  that  ae  waves  generate when  the  local  shear  stress  concentration  at  a  grain  contact  is  sufﬁciently  high  to  rupture  the  grain  boundaries,  and  frictional  slips and  grain  rotations  may   occur  once  the  grain  contacts  have  lost their  cohesion.  in  the  present  study,  crack  threshold  ratios  were  deﬁned  to  identify  the  temperature  and  pressure-dependent  crack  propagation  in the  tested  granite  as  follows,  and  fig.  12  shows  the  crack  propagation  stress  threshold  ratios  of  granite  specimens  tested  at  various conﬁning  pressures  and  temperatures.  crack  closure  stress  threshold   = deviatoric  stress  at  crack  closure  stress   deviatoric  stress  at  failure  ((cid:2)cc)  crack  initiation  stress  threshold   = deviatoric  stress  at  crack  initiation  stress   deviatoric  stress  at  failure  ((cid:2)ci)  crack  damage  stress  threshold   = deviatoric  stress  at  crack  damage  stress  ((cid:2)cd)  deviatoric  stress  at  failure  according  to  the  results,  the  beginning  of  crack  damage  occurs at  earlier  stages  of  deviatoric  loading  for  higher  conﬁning  pressures.  however,  the  crack  damage  stress  increases  with  increasing conﬁnement  due  to  the  inﬂuence  of  conﬁning  pressure  on  thermal crack  development  and  the  suppression  of  the  extension/widening of  existing  micro-cracks.  according  to  fig.  12,  in  the  temperature  range  considered  here,  three  tendencies  can  be  identiﬁed with  increasing  conﬁning  pressure:  increase  of  the  elastic  deformation  region,  decrease  of  the  stable  crack  propagation  region,  and increase  of  the  unstable  crack  propagation  region.  the  crack  initiation  stress  threshold  also  progressively  increases  with  increasing conﬁning  pressure,  which  can  be  attributed  to  the  fact  that  the brittle  behaviour  of  rock  specimens  at  lower  conﬁning  pressures changes  to  quasi-brittle  behaviour  with  increasing  conﬁning  pressure.  this  is  because  the  suppression  of  micro-crack  development is  less  at  low  conﬁning  pressures,  and  therefore  sudden  failures  mostly  occur,  and  the  beginning  of  crack  initiation  occurs  at  earlier  stages  of  deviatoric  loading  at  high  conﬁning  pressures due  to  the  higher  normal  stress  acting  on  micro-cracks,  resulting  in  limited  progression  of  cracking  before  failure.  in  relation to  the  temperature  effect,  increasing  the  temperature  causes  an initial  increment  in  the  crack  propagation  stress  threshold,  followed  by  a  slight  reduction  for  all  the  temperature  conditions considered.  for  example,  at  30  mpa   conﬁnement,  the  crack  damage  stress  threshold  ratios  increased  by  around  6.8%,  10.5%  with increasing  temperature  from  room  temperature  to  100  and  200 ◦c, respectively,  and  reduced  by  around  4.0%  when  the  temperature increased  to  300 ◦c.  this  implies  that  at  low  temperatures  a  suppressed  micro-crack  development  mechanism  is  dominant,  and increasing  the  temperature  causes  crack  damage  to  occur  at  earlier  loading  stages.  interestingly,  at  60  mpa   conﬁnement  the  crack damage  stress  threshold  ratio  increased  by  around  4.9%,  5.4%, 2.6%  with  increasing  temperature  from  room  to  100,  200  and 300 ◦c,  respectively.  this  exhibits  the  cumulative  effect  of  temperature  and  pressure  micro-crack  development  in  the  rock  mass. at  relatively  low  temperatures,  micro-crack  propagation  may  be inhibited  by  the  thermally-induced  plasticity  mechanism  which occurs  at  crack  tips  and  the  increased  bonding  strength  through thermally-induced  rock  matrix  expansion  (which  increases  crack stress  thresholds).  however,  further  increase  of  temperature  creates  thermally-induced  cracks  and  causes  the  grain  boundary cracks  to  widen,  resulting  in  early  crack  damage.  further,  with  the inﬂuence  of  conﬁnement,  micro-crack  development  is  suppressed, causing  a  relatively  low  increment  of  crack  damage  stress  threshold ratios  at  higher  conﬁnements.  3.5.  corresponding  alterations  in  granite  micro-structure  a    comprehensive  micro-structural  analysis  was   also  performed to  identify  the  interior  correspondences  of  the  above-described temperature-dependent  mechanical  behaviour  of  granite.  sem  and optical  microscopic  analyses  were  performed  on  thin  sections of  granite  specimens  at  various  temperatures:  room  temperature  (20 ◦c),  pre-heated  (72  hours)  to  200 ◦c  and  400 ◦c  (fig.  13). these  temperatures  were  selected  to  identify  the  microstructural behaviour  at  200 ◦c,  at  which  the  highest  strength  increment  was observed,  and  400 ◦c,  at  which  clear  thermally-induced  rock  mass weakening  was  observed.  a  specimen  at  room  temperature  was used  as  a  control.  based  on  optical  microscope  imaging,  mineralogical  assembling in  the  granite  specimen  could  be  identiﬁed  by  the  colour  and  texture  of  each  of  the  mineral  assemblages.  further,  a  detailed  sem study  was   performed  using  scanning  electron  imaging  (sei)  and bsei  back-scatter  electron  imaging  (bsei)  techniques.  bsei  images taken  at  low  magniﬁcations  clearly  show  different  mineral  assemblages  and  grain  boundaries  (see  fig.  14).  using  energy-dispersive x-ray  (edx)  technology  with  aztec  oxford  instruments,  chemical  component  mapping  was  generated  in  each  specimen,  and each  mineral  was  identiﬁed  qualitatively.  the  bright  colour  images observed  in  edx  images  indicate  higher  concentration  (higher energy  dispersion)  while  dark  colour  areas  indicate  lower  concentration  (lower  energy  dispersion).  based  on  the  spectrum  of  each point  (point  id),  the  corresponding  mineral  was  identiﬁed  and  a map   spectrum  provided  overall  elements  available  for  each  specimen.  according  to  figs.  13  and  14,  there  are  clear  mineralogical assembling  in  the  granite  specimens,  mainly  with  quartz,  kfeldspar  and  plagioclase.  the  heating  of  granite  up  to  200 ◦c temperature  has  not  caused  any  signiﬁcant  thermally-induced micro-cracks  (in  addition  to  the  pre-existing  faults  and  grain boundaries)  and  almost  all  grain  boundaries  remain  intact.  however,  further  heating  of  granite  to  the  higher  temperature  of 400 ◦c  caused  the  induction  of  some  micro-cracks,  mainly  along  \\x0cw.g.p.  kumari  et  al.  /  geothermics  65  (2017)  44–59   55  table   4 stress  thresholds  for  different  fracturing  stages.  temperature

have  been  partially  parted  and  a  signiﬁcant  number of  grain  boundaries  appear  to  remain  intact  up  to  this  temperature.  furthermore,  based  on  the  edx  mapping,  it  was   conﬁrmed that  intra-granular  cracks  are  mainly  initiated  along  the  feldspar and  quartz  minerals.  intragranular  cracks  were  mainly  observed in  larger  crystals  (crystals  greater  than  0.5  mm)   and  smaller  crystals  remained  un-parted  even  at  400 ◦c.  for  strathbogie  granite, thermally-induced  intra-granular  micro-cracks  seem  to  play  a  signiﬁcant  role  at  relatively  low  temperatures,  probably  due  to  the presence  of  relatively  high  k  feldspar  and  biotite  contents.  similar  observations  have  been  reported  in  bauer  and  johnson’s  (1979) study  conducted  for  charcoal  granite,  where  intra-granular  microcracks  predominantly  occur  compared  to  grain  boundary  cracks. the  sem  analysis  is  also  consistent  with  this  ﬁnding,  which  exhibits inhibition  of  micro-crack  development  followed  by  micro-cracking at  relatively  high  temperatures.  the  crack  propagation  process  in  any  rock  mass  is  largely inﬂuenced  by  the  mineralogical  composition,  because  cracks  normally  propagate  through  weaker  planes  of  the  rock  mass.  since granite  is  an  igneous  type  of  rock,  two  main  types  of  thermallyinduced  cracking  modes  can  be  identiﬁed:  inter-granular  and  intragranular.  the  amount  of  inter-granular  or  intra-granular  cracking is  dependent  on  the  stress  state,  rock  type  and  mineralogy  of the  rock  mass.  inter-granular  cracks  occur  along  grain  boundaries, pre-existing  faults  and  micro-cracks  of  the  rock,  while  intragranular  cracks  occur  through  weaker  mineralogical  constituents (kranz,  1983).  for  example,  k feldspar  and  biotite  are  weaker  mineralogical  constituents  due  to  their  large  crystals  (>10  mm), as  crystals  greater  than  2–3  mm  in  size  are  generally  deﬁned  as weaker  mineralogical  constituents  compared  to  equi-dimensional small  crystals  like  quartz  (homand-etienne  and  houpert,  1989). based  on  experimental  results,  intra-granular  cracking  is  highly temperature-dependent  due  to  the  temperature dependent  dislocations  in  the  rocks.  this  is  because  different  mineralogical components  have  different  thermo-elastic  moduli  and  thermal conductivities  (kranz,  1983;  dwivedi  et  al.,  2008).  these  observations  suggest  that  micro-cracking  in  granite  is highly  temperature dependent,  as  evidenced  by  the  previously observed  initial  strength  gain  followed  by  slight  strength  reduction  with  increasing  temperature  in  the  tested  granite.  however, this  shows  that  granite  needs  to  be  heated  to  a  sufﬁcient  temperature  to  cause  thermal  cracks  in  it  and  therefore,  heating  to  a  lower temperature  may   only  cause  a  strength  gain  through  the  thermal expansion  of  the  rock  matrix.  this  is  consistent  with  the  results of  bauer  and  johnson  (1979).  the  mechanical  properties  of  charcoal  granite  in  their  study  remained  relatively  steady  until  200 ◦c, and  westerly  granite  exhibited  a  signiﬁcant  thermal  dependency, even  at  relatively  low  temperatures  (<200 ◦c).  in  homand-etienne and  houpert  (1989)  study,  the  variation  of  uni-axial  compressive strength  of  both  semones  and  remiremont  granites  is  insigniﬁcant until  400 ◦c,  followed  by  signiﬁcant  reductions  at  higher  temperatures.  these  results  indicate  the  dependency  of  mineralogical composition  and  grain  size  distribution  on  the  temperature dependent  mechanical  behaviour  in  various  types  of  granites.  however,  \\x0cw.g.p.  kumari  et  al.  /  geothermics  65  (2017)  44–59   57  fig.  14.  bse  images  of  strathbogie  granite  with  edx  mapping:  (a)

granite  under  four  different  conﬁning  pressures  (10,  30, 60,  90  mpa)  and  four  different  temperatures  (rt,  100,  200,  300 ◦c), simulating  various  geothermal  reservoir  conditions.  the  following conclusions  can  be  drawn:   mechanical  behaviour  of  the  tested  granite  is  inﬂuenced  by  both reservoir  depth  and  temperature,  and  the  depth  effect  is  much greater  than  the  temperature  effect.   granite  located  at  relatively  smaller  depths  appears  to  fail through  shear  localization  and  increasing  depth  may  cause  this to  change  to  ductile  failure  through  strain  hardening.  a  progressive  enhancement  in  stress  threshold  with  increasing  conﬁning pressure  is  observed  in  strathbogie  granite.  such  behaviours exhibit  greater  strength  and  lower  brittle  characteristics  in  granite  located  at  greater  depths.   increasing  of  temperature  causes  granite’s  strength  to  be enhanced  up  to  a  certain  temperature  (around  200 ◦c  for  strathbogie  granite)  through  the  possible  thermal  expansion  of  the rock  matrix  and  further  increasing  of  temperature  may   cause  it to  weaken  by  inducing  thermal  cracks.  this  was  conﬁrmed  by the  micro-structural  analysis,  which  did  not  reveal  any  noticeable  amount  of  thermally-induced  micro-cracking  in  strathbogie granite  up  to  200 ◦c,  and  heating  of  the  granite  to  a  greater  temperature  as  400 ◦c  caused  many  intra-granular  cracks  in  quartz and  feldspar  and  some  grain  boundary  cracks  between  quartz  and feldspar  minerals.  furthermore,  according  to  ae  analysis,  increasing  the  temperature  ﬁrst  causes  the  crack  propagation  stress threshold  to  increase  and  further  increasing  of  the  temperature causes  it  to  be  slightly  reduced.  this  indicates  a  suppression  of micro-cracks  at  low  temperatures  by  matrix  expansion  and  the development  of  micro-cracks  through  thermally-induced  damage  at  higher  temperatures.   finally  an  attempt  was  made  to  improve  the  conventional  mohrcoulomb  failure  criteria  for  geothermal  reservoirs  with  extreme pressures  and  temperatures,  because  the  conventional  criteria are  not  applicable  to  extreme  conditions.  acknowledgements  this  research  project  is  funded  by

strength  criteria  are  available  for  intact rock,  the  practical  application  of  most  of  them  for  geothermal reservoirs  in-situ  model  parameters  required  when  considering  the  available  high-pressure  and high-temperature  environment  in  underground  reservoirs.  of  the various  failure  criteria,  the  mohr-coulomb  failure  criteria  have been  extensively  used  in  the  ﬁeld  and  have  made  a  signiﬁcant  contribution  to  the  determination  of  rock  mass  failure.  however,  they have  some  major  limitations,  including  ignoring  the  intermediate stress  (cid:2)2 inﬂuence  (which  has  been  proven  to  have  a  substantial inﬂuence  on  rock  strength)  and  the  assumed  linearity  (the  strength criteria  of  rock  are  non-linear  in  reality).  after  re-analyzing  thousands  of  reported  triaxial  experiments  and  combining  the  critical state  concept  proposed  by  barton  (1976),  singh  et  al.  (2011)  proposed  a  non-linear  mohr-coulomb  failure  criterion.  according  to the  ﬁndings  of  singh  et  al.  (2011),  the  mohr-coulomb  shear  strength parameters  should  only  be  obtained  by  performing  conventional tri-axial  tests  under  low  conﬁning  stresses  (in  the  linear  region  of the  mohr-coulomb  failure  envelope).  according  to  their  statistical analysis,  (cid:2)cc ≈   (cid:2)crit,  where  (cid:2)c and  (cid:2) crit are  uni-axial  compressive strength  and  critical  conﬁning  pressure,  respectively.  the  modiﬁed mohr-coulomb  failure  criterion  proposed  by  singh  et  al.  is  given below: (cid:2)1 −   (cid:2)3 = where,  (cid:2)ci ≈    (cid:2)ci + 2sin(cid:3)i0 sin(cid:3)i0   ucs  of  the  rock  =  2ciocos(cid:3)i0/1   sin(cid:3)i0,  (cid:3)i0 and cio are  friction  angle  and  cohesion  obtained  at  low  conﬁning  pressures.  sin(cid:3)i0) (cid:2)32  2sin(cid:3)i0  (cid:2)3 ≤  (cid:2)3 −  (cid:2)crit (1   for  0     (cid:2)crit  −   −   1     however,  even  the  improved  mohr-coulomb  failure  criteria cannot  be  directly  applied  to  geothermal  reservoir  rocks  at  extreme pressures  and  temperatures,  because  the  strength  response  is altered  by  the  thermal  effect  (heuze,  1983).  to  date,  no  extensive study  has  captured  this  thermal  response  in  the  improved  mohrcoulomb  failure  criteria.  such  a  realistic  approach  is  necessary for  deep  underground  engineering  applications  like  geothermal energy  extraction.  the  concepts  of  barton  (1976)  and  singh  et  al. (2011)  are  therefore  incorporated  into  the  temperature  inﬂuence in  this  study  and  an  attempt  is  made  to  propose  novel  strength  criteria  for  geothermal  reservoir  rocks  based  on  experimental  data:  + 2sin(cid:3)i (t)  sin(cid:3)i (t) (cid:2)3 −  −    1     −      (cid:2)3 (t) = 2ci (t) cos(cid:3)i (t) sin(cid:3)i (t)  1     (cid:2)1 −  (4)  (cid:2)3 ≤    (cid:2)crit  ≤   sin(cid:3)i (t)) (cid:2)32 for  0   −   (cid:2)crit (t)  (1   2sin(cid:3)i (t)  (7)  10−7t 3  ×     4.52   0.0002t 2 +  −   ×   −   ×   where,  (cid:3)i (t) ,  ci (t) and  (cid:2)crit (t) are  temperature-dependent friction  angle,  cohesion  and  critical  conﬁning  pressure  and  can  be given  as  follows: f1 (t) =  1.034  (cid:3)i (t) (cid:3)io ci (t) cio ccrit (t)  f2 (t) =  0.7795   0.0001t 2 +  10−8t 3(6)  10−5t 2 −  0.1504t   10−8t 3  0.0032t     2.22     7.62   (5)  3.53   =   +   ×   −   =   +     1.7887   0.0226t   +     f3 (t) = =  ucs  however,  it  should  be  noticed  that  the  modiﬁed  temperaturedependent  criteria  may   only  be  applicable  for  similar  types  of granites  under  the  tested  experimental  conditions.  58   w.g.p.  kumari  et  al.  /

wang, 2014). site selection for china's hlw repository started in 1985 (wang, 2010). the efforts have been focused on potential hlw repository sites located within granite intrusions in mainland china. since 1999, the beijing research  ⁎ corresponding author.  e-mail address: xingguang100@126.com (x.g. zhao).  http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tecto.2016.06.021 0040-1951/© 2016 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.  institute of uranium geology (briug) has performed site characterization studies in the beishan area, china. so far, the beishan area has been considered as the most potential candidate area for china's hlw repository.  among all the engineering properties of crystalline rocks at a potential hlw repository site, the thermal conductivity is one of the most important parameters in design consideration because it has a direct impact on the evaluation of the necessary repository volume and the optimization of the repository layout (sundberg and hellström, 2009). for instance, in the swedish kbs-3 concept for geological disposal of spent fuel, copper canisters with cast iron inserts containing the spent fuel are surrounded by bentonite for isolation and mechanical protection (brantberger et al., 2006). the heat generated by the spent fuel will increase the temperature of all components of the repository. for the bentonite buffer outside the canisters, the peak temperature must not exceed 100 °c. this requirement implies that the canisters cannot be deposited arbitrarily close to each other. on the other hand, unnecessarily large distances between the canisters will mean inefﬁcient and costly use of the repository rock volume (hökmark et al., 2009). to fulﬁll the temperature requirement, the rocks with low thermal conductivities will  \\x0cx.g. zhao et al. / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137  125  lead to a larger distance between canisters than for a case with high thermal conductivities. this is because the rocks with low thermal conductivities will give rise to higher temperatures in the bentonite (sundberg et al., 2008). hence, to design and construct repositories successfully, it is essential to perform an accurate assessment of the thermal conductivity characteristics of the host rock. over the past few decades, various experimental approaches have been employed to measure the thermal conductivity of rocks. the results indicate that the thermal conductivity of rocks is closely associated with mineral composition, porosity, texture, and density, etc. (birch and clark, 1940; clauser and huenges, 1995; hartmann et al., 2005; özkahraman et al., 2004; pasquale et al., 2015; ray et al., 2007; sundberg et al., 2009). for crystalline rocks with relatively homogeneous texture and low porosity, the mineral composition dominates the thermal conductivity. in volcanic and sedimentary rocks, the high variability of porosity in these rocks is a major factor controlling the thermal conductivity (clauser and huenges, 1995; özkahraman et al., 2004). for example, increasing porosity, which acts as barrier to the ﬂow of heat, often results in both lower p-wave velocity and lower thermal conductivity values (özkahraman et al., 2004). for a given rock, water content and temperature have an inﬂuence on its thermal conductivity. generally, the thermal conductivity of the rock increases and decreases with increasing water content (cho and kwon, 2010; cho et al., 2009) and temperature (abdulagatova et al., 2009; birch and clark, 1940; heuze, 1983; miao et al., 2014; mottaghy et al., 2008; vosteen and schellschmidt, 2003), respectively. moreover, the effect of water saturation on the thermal conductivity of rocks shows a generally increasing trend with increasing porosity (nagaraju and roy, 2014). given that the thermal conductivity of surrounding rocks around the excavations will be changed by the excavation-induced stress, some researchers studied the inﬂuence of pressure on the thermal conductivity of rocks (abdulagatova et al., 2010; abdulagatova et al., 2009; demırcı et al., 2004; görgülü et al., 2008; sibbitt, 1976; walsh and decker, 1966; zimmerman, 1989). one of the main ﬁndings achieved from these investigations shows that the thermal conductivity  varies with the pressure exerted on the rock. with increasing applied pressure, the thermal conductivity starts to increase and subsequently the increase rate tends to be a constant value due to gradual closure of cracks and pores within the rock (görgülü et al., 2008; walsh and decker, 1966).  while the above-mentioned studies provide meaningful insight into the thermal conductivity of various rocks, the thermal conductivity characteristics of low-porosity crystalline rocks subjected to different external factors such as water saturation, temperature and compression stress have not been fully understood. on the other hand, the information on the thermal conductivity of rocks in a potential hlw repository site must be known with sufﬁcient conﬁdence to provide necessary input conditions for its long-term safety assessment, which is one of the motivations for this study. in this work, experimental investigations on the thermal conductivity of the beishan granitic rocks are conducted using the transient plane source (tps) method. in the following discussion, rock sampling and basic physical properties of the rock specimens are introduced ﬁrst. testing facilities and procedures are then described. subsequently, the water saturation, temperature and compression stress dependent thermal conductivity characteristics of the tested rocks are evaluated comprehensively, and ﬁnally some insights are obtained.  2. rock sampling and preparation  the beishan area is situated in gansu province of northwestern china (see fig. 1). after a long geological evolution and weathering process, the topography of this area is characterized by a ﬂat gobi and small gentle rolling hills with elevations ranging between 1400 and 2000 m above the sea level. the crust in this area possesses a blocky structure with many granite intrusions (see fig. 2). other surrounding rocks include mainly metamorphic and sedimentary rocks, as well as quaternary cover. rock sampling was carried out in the jijicao and xinchang rock blocks, which are currently considered as two of the key investigation sub-areas during site selection and characterization.  fig. 1. geographical location of the beishan area and a photo showing its typical topography.  \\x0c126  x.g. zhao et al. / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137  xinchang  bs06  bs18  bs19  jijicao  bs16  bs15  bs05  n  2.5 km  granitic rock  sedimentary rock  metamorphic rock  quaternary cover  borehole  fault  fig. 2. rock sampling from six boreholes in the jijicao and xinchang sub-areas for thermal conductivity measurements.  intact drill cores with a diameter of approximately 63 mm were taken from six sub-vertical boreholes (i.e., boreholes bs05, bs06, bs15, bs16, bs18 and bs19) in these two sub-areas. the borehole locations are presented in fig. 2.  field observations indicated that the collected granitic rocks were relatively isotropic in texture and mineralogical composition. to evaluate the geological nature of the rocks, a series of thin sections were prepared and then exposed to cross-polarized light under an optical microscope to identify the dominant minerals in the rocks. the percentages of the dominant minerals were determined by point counting on thin sections. for each thin section approximately 500 points covering phenocrysts and groundmass were counted. according to the quartz-alkali feldspar-plagioclase (qap) diagram (streckeisen, 1976), the rocks can further be classiﬁed. it can be observed from fig. 3 that the rocks contain mainly a moderate to low amount of quartz and alkali feldspar, and a moderate to high amount of plagioclase. this means that the collected rocks dominantly range from granodiorite to monzogranite. for grain size characteristics, the rocks are from ﬁne grained to, medium to coarse grained. an overview of the basic information of the rocks is listed in table 1. based on the borehole no. and sampling depth, these rocks have been divided into eight groups.  a total of 47 pairs of rock specimens, 50 mm in diameter, were prepared from the drill cores with a length to diameter ratio of approximately 0.5. in particular, specimen ends were polished carefully using a  q  90          90  i granodiorite ii monzogranite  60                                   60          ii         i    bs05 bs06 bs15 bs16 bs18-1 bs18-2 bs19-1 bs19-2  20                                                                     20  5                                                                                  5 p  10                 35                       65                  90  a  fig. 3. qap classiﬁcation of the eight rock groups based on modal analysis.  grinding machine until the ﬂatness and roughness of the ends are less than 10 μm and 3 μm, respectively. the ﬂat and polished specimen end surfaces minimize the thermal contact resistance during thermal conductivity measurement. a minimum of ten specimens for each rock group were prepared.  3. test methodology  3.1. an introduction to the used tps method  in the ﬁelds of geology and geophysics, laboratory approaches to measuring soil and rock thermal conductivity can mainly be divided into two groups: steady state and transient state. in this work, the transient plane source (tps) method (gustafsson, 1991; log and gustafsson, 1995) was utilized to measure the thermal conductivity of the specimens. as one of the transient measurement methods, the tps technique is based on the use of a transiently heated plane sensor (i.e., hot disk sensor) and a hot disk thermal constants analyser (see fig. 4a). the used hot disk tps2500s system can measure thermal conductivity of materials ranging from 0.01 to 400 w/mk. the hot disk sensor consists of a continuous double spiral, which is etched out of a thin nickel foil (fig. 4e). this spiral is sandwiched between two sheets of electrical insulation materials made of kapton. the sensor acts both as a heat source for increasing the temperature of the specimens and as a dynamic temperature sensor for recording the temperature increase. during the measurement, the temperature in the sensor rises and heat starts to ﬂow to the specimens. the temperature rise in the sensor provides an indicator of the thermal properties of the specimens. if the specimens have good thermal conducting properties, the heat will be transported rapidly inside the specimens. on the contrary, if the specimens have good thermal insulation properties, the sensor temperature will rise faster and the heat will not be transported as much as in the test of the good thermal conducting specimens. compared with steady state measurement methods such as the divided bar (beck and beck, 1958; birch, 1950; sass et al., 1971) and the guarded hot plate (abdulagatova et al., 2009; alishaev et al., 2012), one of significant advantages of the tps technique is that the thermal conductivity of materials can be measured more quickly, typically from several to tens of seconds. hence, a long wait for thermal gradients to equilibrate is not required and the moisture migration in response to temperature gradients was minimized (jackson and taylor, 1986). on the other hand, unlike some transient methods such as thermal needle probes (barry-macaulay et al., 2013; von herzen and maxwell, 1959), which are commonly used for soils and soft rocks, the tps method can be  \\x0cx.g. zhao et al. / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137  127  table 1 basic information and geological description of the tested rocks.  rock type and group  basic information  mineral composition  naked eye observation  photomicrograph of a thin section  monzogranite (bs05)  location: jijicao borehole no.: bs05 sampling depth: 5–7 m number of specimen pairs: 7 grain size: medium  plagioclase: 33.7% ± 5.8%;

popov et al., 2003). hence, the thermal resistance between the specimen ends and the sensor exists (see section 3.2). so far, the tps technology has been widely used to  \\x0c128  x.g. zhao et al. / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137  a   c   temperature control system  b   hot disk thermal   constants analyser   sensor   platen   specimens  d   e   specimens  insulation material  chamber   sensor   specimens   oil bath   sensor   double spiral  cable extension  fig. 4. the hot disk tps2500s system (a) used to measure the thermal conductivity of specimens under room temperature (d), high temperature (c), and uniaxial compression (b) conditions. a hot disk sensor showing its key components (e).  determine the thermal properties of different materials (lagüela et al., 2015;

θ ¼ a2=d  where t is the time measured from the start of the transient recording, θ is the characteristic time, which depends both on parameters of the sensor and the sample, and d is the thermal diffusivity of the sample.  according to eq. (2), and δtðτþ and d(τ) plotted as a function of τ provides a linear relationship with a slope that is a function of p0, a, and k. thermal conductivity k can be obtained by ﬁtting the experimental data to the straight line given by eq. (2); thermal diffusivity d is calculated from eq. (3) taking into account the τ value determined in the previous ﬁt.  as mentioned above, the solution of the thermal conductivity equation is based on the assumption that the hot disk sensor is located in an inﬁnite material in perfect contact with the sensor surface. this means that the heat ﬂow generated from each measurement must not reach the outside boundaries of the specimen (hot disk, 2007). meanwhile, a careful preparation of specimen ends is required to minimize thermal contact resistance. an estimation of how far the heat ﬂow has proceeded in the specimen during a recording is the probing depth δp, which is deﬁned as (hot disk, 2007):  ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ p dt  δp ¼ 2  ð4þ  to determine the thermal conductivity with good accuracy, the shortest distance from any part of the sensor to the nearest outside boundary of the sample should be larger than δp. in our experiments, the used hot disk sensor has a radius of 6.403 mm. the shortest distance is about 19 mm, and the probing depth is approximately 10 mm. for this probing depth value, we can consider that we are conducting a bulk measurement.  3.3. test procedures  3.3.1. tests on specimens under saturated and dry conditions  firstly, the specimens were immersed by deionized water in a vacuum for a period of 96 h. the specimens were then taken from the vacuum and the water droplets on the surfaces were wiped dry, care

constant under vacuum within 72 h (see fig. 5), indicating that the specimens were saturated with water. subsequently, the hot disk sensor was horizontally placed between the two saturated specimen pieces with the double spiral centered and totally covered, and the two specimen pieces were ﬁrmly clamped together to ensure that there was no air gap between the sensor and the specimen end surfaces, as presented in fig. 4d. in order to remain water saturation, the saturated specimens and the sensor were kept in a plastic bag during thermal conductivity measurement (adl-zarrabi, 2004). after the test, the used water-saturated specimens were suffered from dehydration treatment in a thermostatic drying oven at 105 °c for a period of 24 h and subsequently cooled in a desiccator to measure the thermal conductivity under a dry condition. meanwhile, the mass of the dry specimens (mdry) was measured, and the porosity (n) of the specimens was calculated using the equations  n ¼ 100v p  v %  v p ¼ msat − mdry  ρw  ð5þ  ð6þ  where v is the bulk rock volume, vp is the pore volume, and ρw is the density of water. for each pair of specimens saturated or dried, measurements on the thermal conductivity were carried out at room temperature (25 ± 1 °c).  3.3.2. tests on specimens under increasing temperature  to investigate the effect of temperature on the thermal conductivity of the tested rocks, measurements were performed on dry specimens from 40 °c to 150 °c based on the requirements of the used test equipment. compared with measurements at room temperature, the experiments under high temperature are time consuming due to a slow stepwise heating process by using a constant temperature oil bath and a temperature control system, as shown in fig. 4c. the thermal conductivity measurement can only be conducted until the two specimen pieces in the chamber with a specimen holder within the oil bath have reached thermal equilibrium and kept a target temperature value. during thermal equilibrium of the oil bath, the hot disk sensor monitors continuously the temperature variation of the specimens. for our tests, the thermal conductivity of the specimens was measured when the recorded temperature variation of the specimens is less than 0.04 °c. in general, 32 h were needed to complete one test. a typical temperature-time history during the test is

measurement, the load was maintained constant for a period of about 15 min to avoid residual temperature drifts on the specimens. based on the in-situ stress measurement results obtained from the beishan area (zhao et al., 2013), the maximum axial compression stress applied to the specimens was set to be 45 mpa to approximately simulate the excavation-induced stress near the vertical hlw disposal element boundary at a depth of 600 m. the axial stress applied to the specimens was recorded automatically, and the used stress path throughout the course of testing is presented in fig. 7. the experiments were conducted at room temperature.  according to previous experimental results (zhao et al., 2015a; zhao et al., 2015b), the identiﬁed crack initiation stresses of cylindrical specimens of beishan granitic rocks under uniaxial compression using the cumulative ae hit (caeh) method range from 45.3 to 109.1 mpa, which are larger than the maximum compression stress adopted in the present study. hence, the stress-induced rock damage might not occur in the tested specimens during loading. it should be mentioned that in the process of loading, the friction may occur at the interfaces between the specimen ends and the sensor. due to limitation of the tps measurement technique, the utilized test method does not consider the potential inﬂuence of interface friction effect on the experimental results. to reduce or eliminate the friction effect, further efforts are needed to produce innovative design for the test equipment. although not perfect, the developed test system provides a feasible means for us to gain insight into thermal conductivity behaviors of rocks under compression.  4. test results  4.1. inﬂuence of water saturation on the thermal conductivity  table

content of the specimens, leading to difﬁculties in evaluating the relationship between the thermal conductivity and the water saturation degree of the specimens quantitatively.  3.3.3. tests on specimens under uniaxial compression  the uniaxial compression tests on dry specimens were conducted using a hydraulic servo-controlled compression machine. for each test, two specimen pieces with the hot disk sensor were contained between steel platens machined to match their end surfaces, as shown in fig. 4b. the interfaces between the specimens and the steel platens were daubed with a thin layer of lubricant to reduce the end effect of the platens during loading. when the experimental setup was completed, axial-load control was used with a loading rate of 100 n/s and the axial load was increased with an increment  thermal conductivity measurements were carried out on the 40 pairs of specimens both in dry and water-saturated conditions, and the results are listed in table 2. a statistical analysis shows that for the eight rock groups under dry or saturated state, the standard deviation (sd) and coefﬁcient of variation (cov) of the thermal conductivity are all less than 0.06 w/mk and 4%, respectively, indicating that the results between specimens in each rock group have a good consistency. for all rock groups, the average thermal conductivity values in the dry state

the dry specimens were saturated with water, water with a higher thermal conductivity (0.604 w/mk) replaced the air with a lower thermal conductivity (0.025 w/mk) in the void of the rocks, leading to

 to 150 °c. the thermal conductivity of these specimens at room temperature (25 °c) was also measured and the data were added to this ﬁgure. it is seen that the thermal conductivity of the specimens shows a decaying trend with increasing temperature, and the values at 150 °c range from 5.7% to 8.7% lower than those at room temperature. this means that within the used temperature range, the inﬂuence of the increasing temperature on the decay of thermal conductivity for these rocks is limited. on the other hand, a possible reason for the gradual decrease in thermal conductivity is the generation of thermally induced microcracks in the rocks because of a mismatch between thermal expansion coefﬁcients of adjacent mineral grains in a homogeneous temperature ﬁeld (jansen et al., 1993), which has been demonstrated from a microcracking perspective based on numerical simulations (zhao, 2016). based on the experimental data, the relationship between thermal conductivity and temperature can be described using the equation: k ¼ kr − at2  ð8þ  where kr is the thermal conductivity of the rock at room temperature (25 °c), t is the temperature in celsius, and a is the ﬁt coefﬁcient (see table 3). the parameter a affects the decaying velocity of the thermal conductivity with the temperature, i.e., the decaying velocity of the thermal conductivity increases as a increases. as shown in table 3, a in eq. (8) varies from rock to rock and can be determined only using laboratory tests. in order to develop a model for predicting a,   individual fit  overall fit (model)  bs15-07  bs18-1-08  bs06-05 bs18-2-05 bs19-1-05 bs05-07  bs16-05  2.9  2.8  2.7  2.6  2.5  2.4  2.3  2.2  thermal conductivity (w/mk)  0  20  40  80  60 100 temperature (oc)  120  140  160  fig. 13. comparison of overall ﬁt using the temperature and rock porosity dependent thermal conductivity model and individual ﬁt of seven pairs of specimens in different rock groups.  behavior. however, with further increase of rock porosity, the approximately linear relationship between kdry and ksat is not valid anymore. for example, the rock groups bs05 and bs15 with average porosity values greater than or equal to 0.68% exhibit higher thermal conductivity in the water-saturated state relative to the dry state.  to evaluate the thermal conductivity of rocks, various mixing models such as the geometric mean (lichtenecker, 1924), the arithmetic mean (voigt, 1928), the hashin–shtrikman mean (hashin and shtrikman, 1962), and the effective-medium mean (bruggeman, 1935; clauser, 2009) have been proposed. comprehensive overviews and case studies on such mixing models can be found in (abdulagatova et al., 2009; clauser, 2009; fuchs et al., 2013; hartmann, 2005; ray et al., 2015). based on the experimental data (see table 2) in combination with the methodology used by fuchs et al. (2013), the abovementioned mixing models were used to predict the thermal conductivity values of the tested rocks in the water-saturated state. fig. 9 shows the comparison between measured and calculated thermal conductivities for the four different models. it can be observed from fig. 9a, b, and d that the geometric mean, the arithmetic mean, and the effectivemedium mean yield similar prediction results and consistently underestimate the thermal conductivity of the eight rock groups, especially for the groups with relatively high porosity values (e.g., groups bs05 and bs15). the hashin–shtrikman mean shows a reasonably good ﬁt for all rock groups, as shown in fig. 9c. the analysis results are basically in line with observations reported by fuchs et al. (2013) because most of the evaluated mixing models used in their analysis also underestimate the thermal conductivity of the rocks. however, the geometric mean model was rated as the best ﬁt to their data set. it should be noted that the rocks used in their analysis covered different rock types with a large range in porosity, from almost zero to about 30%. in addition, the measured thermal conductivity values of these rocks spans the interval between 1.0 and 6.5 w/mk. the present investigations focused mainly on the granitic rocks with low porosities and a narrow thermal conductivity range. hence, the large difference of rock properties may result in uncertainties between analysis results obtained from various mixing models. more work is required to explain this discrepancy.  nagaraju and roy (2014) deﬁned the effect of water saturation on thermal conductivity (s) as a function of porosity of rocks, and s is expressed by s ¼ ksat − kdry  ð7þ  kdry  according to the measurement results listed in table 2, we established the relationship between s and the porosity of the rocks, as presented in fig. 10. analysis of fig. 10 reveals that the effect of water saturation on thermal conductivity of rocks presents an increasing trend with an increase of porosity. a linear form expression can ﬁt the data reasonably well while ensuring that the line passes through the origin.  4.2. inﬂuence of temperature on the thermal conductivity  fig. 11 presents the variation of thermal conductivity of seven pairs of dry specimens in different rock groups with temperature from 40 °c  table 3 fit coefﬁcient a for thermal conductivity-temperature curves of seven pairs of specimens in different rock groups.  rock type and specimen no.  monzogranite (bs05-07) granodiorite (bs06-05) monzogranite (bs15-07) granodiorite (bs16-05) monzogranite (bs18-1-08) granodiorite (bs18-2-05) monzogranite (bs19-1-07)  a (10−6)  8.821 5.679 8.394 4.871 6.891 5.728 6.385  r2  0.9830 0.9334 0.9853 0.9289 0.9262 0.9581 0.9933  132  x.g. zhao et al. / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137  \\x0cx.g. zhao et al. / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137  133  n=2  20  10 axial stress (mpa)  30  40  n=3  20  10 axial stress (mpa)  30  40  50  50  3.4  3.3  3.2  3.1  3.0  2.9  2.8  2.7  2.6  2.5  2.4  c  thermal conductivity (w/mk)  50  0  f  2.9  2.8  2.7  2.6  2.5  2.4  thermal conductivity (w/mk)  50  0  n=3  20  10 axial stress (mpa)  30  40  n=3  20  10 axial stress (mpa)  30  40  bs05 bs06 bs15 bs16 bs18-1 bs18-2 bs19-1 bs19-2  y=24.15-24.99e-x (r2=0.9296)  21  18  15  12  0369  i  r(%)   n=1  20  10 axial stress (mpa)  30  40  50  0.0  0.3  0.9  1.2 0.6 porosity (%)  1.5  1.8  b  3.0  2.9  2.8  2.7  2.6  2.5  2.4  thermal conductivity (w/mk)  50  0  3.2e 3.1  3.0  2.9  2.8  2.7  2.6  2.5  2.4  thermal conductivity (w/mk)  50  0  3.2h  3.1  3.0  2.9  2.8  2.7  2.6  thermal conductivity (w/mk)  50  0  n=3  20  10 axial stress (mpa)  30  40  n=3  20  10 axial stress (mpa)  30  40  n=2  20  10 axial stress (mpa)  30  40  3.0  2.9  2.8  2.7  2.6  2.5  2.4  2.3  2.2  a  thermal conductivity (w/mk)  3.0d 2.9  2.8  2.7  2.6  2.5  2.4  2.3  2.2  2.1  2.0  thermal conductivity (w/mk)  3.0g  2.9  2.8  2.7  2.6  2.5  2.4  thermal conductivity (w/mk)  0  0  0  fig. 14. inﬂuence of axial compression stress on the thermal conductivity of the eight rock groups: (a) bs05, (b) bs06, (c) bs15, (d) bs16, (e) bs18-1, (f) bs18-2, (g) bs19-1 and (h) bs19-2, and variation of the increase rate of the thermal conductivity (r) with rock porosity (i). error bars indicate the standard deviation of the thermal conductivity. n in the ﬁgures represents the number of specimen pairs in each rock group.  we attempted to relate a with other rock parameters and found that a depended on the magnitude of rock porosity (n), as presented in fig. 12. the coefﬁcient a varies with porosity n according to the following equation: a ¼ 9:43 − 0:71=n2  ð9þ  according to eqs.

(11) is not sensitive to the variation of rock porosity, and is within the range from 0.20 to 0.27 except for the rock group bs19-1. for simplicity, an average value of c = 0.24 obtained from table 4 is used to approximately describe the trend, as shown in fig. 15b. using eqs. (11)–(12) and the constant coefﬁcient c, an overall ﬁt is made for these rock groups to reproduce the rock porosity-dependent thermal conductivity under different axial stresses. a comparison between individual and overall ﬁt results is presented in fig. 16. it is found that for each rock group subjected to different compression stresses, the difference of the thermal conductivity values from the individual and overall ﬁts is less than 0.05 w/mk. the good agreement indicates that the established rock porosity-dependent model can capture the nonlinear stress-thermal conductivity relationships of the beishan granitic rocks satisfactorily.  5. discussion  one of the ﬁndings from the experimental investigations in the previous sections is that the rock porosity has an inﬂuence on the thermal conductivity of the beishan granitic rocks under water saturation, increasing temperature and compression stress conditions, although the porosity of tested rocks is relatively low. it is well known that for low-porosity crystalline rocks, the mineral composition plays an important role in dominating the thermal conductivity. the crystalline rocks are mainly made up of quartz, feldspars, and maﬁc minerals such as pyroxene, amphibole and biotite, and the content of minerals from these three mineral groups basically determines a rock's thermal conductivity (clauser and huenges, 1995). as mentioned in section 2, a model analysis on a total of 46 thin sections of the rocks was conducted to identify the dominant minerals in the rocks. as listed in table 1, the main minerals of these rocks include quartz, plagioclase, k-feldspar and biotite. among these four minerals, quartz has the highest thermal conductivity (7.69 w/mk) while another three minerals have a thermal conductivity range between 1.70 and 2.29 w/mk (horai, 1971). hence, when the porosity values of the specimens in different rock groups are close to each other, quartz content in the rocks may determine the thermal conductivity. according to the data listed in table 2, fig. 17a presents the inﬂuence of quartz content on the average thermal conductivity of different rock groups in dry state. it is seen that except for rock groups bs05 and bs15 (which have relatively large porosity values of 1.37% and 0.68%, respectively), thermal conductivity of the rocks appears an increasing trend with increasing quartz content. when the specimens are subjected to compression stresses, the original pores and cracks in the rocks tend to close, and the effective contact areas between mineral grains increase, leading to a signiﬁcant decay of the porosity effect on the thermal conductivity, especially for rocks with relatively high porosity. on the other hand, the closure of pores and cracks increases the contact opportunity of quartz grains, and hence improves the transportation capability of heat ﬂow in the rocks. under this condition, an obvious increase of the thermal conductivity for all rock groups with increasing quartz content can be observed, as presented in fig. 17b.  6. conclusions  beishan granitic rocks are candidate host rock types for china's hlw repository. in this paper, thermal conductivity characteristics of the beishan granitic rocks have been investigated using the transient plane source (tps) method. the measurement results indicate that for the used eight rock groups with a porosity range from 0.40% to 1.37%, the average thermal conductivity values in the dry state range between 2.412 and 2.812 w/mk. the values under water-saturated condition range from 2.602 to 3.156 w/mk. meanwhile, the effect of water saturation on thermal conductivity presents an increasing trend with an increase of rock porosity. using several mixing models proposed by previous researchers, we found that the hashin–shtrikman mean model showed a reasonably good ﬁt to the experimental data while another three models  currently obtained data, a best ﬁtting equation of axial stressdependent thermal conductivity for these rocks can be expressed as (demırcı et al., 2004) k ¼ k0 þ bσ c  ð11þ  1  where k0 is the thermal conductivity of the rock at zero stress, σ1 is the axial stress, and b and c are ﬁt coefﬁcients, as listed in table 4. analysis of eq. (11) reveals that the coefﬁcient b plays a critical role in controlling the increasing gradient of the thermal conductivity in the initial loading stage (i.e., crack closure stage). the coefﬁcient c dominantly affects the increasing velocity of the thermal conductivity in the subsequent elastic deformation stage. based on experimental investigations on the thermal conductivity of some rocks subjected to uniaxial stresses using a steady-state apparatus developed by demırcı et al. (2004), görgülü et al. (2008) found that the parameters b and c depended on the magnitude of elastic modulus of the rocks, and subsequently established an elastic modulus dependent model to predict the thermal conductivity values under pressure. unfortunately, in the present study, the elastic moduli of the tested rocks have not been available. therefore, the model proposed by görgülü et al. (2008) cannot be used to ﬁt our test results. according to fig. 14, we found that the increasing gradients of the thermal conductivities in the initial loading stage were generally large for the rocks with a high porosity such as rock groups bs05 and bs15. hence, the coefﬁcient b is associated with the rock porosity n, i.e., b increases as n increases, as presented in fig. 15a. an exponential form

thermal conductivity of the rocks under the water-saturated condition. future work is demanded to verify the validity of various mixing models using different rock types with a large porosity range.  with increasing temperature from 25 °c to 150 °c, the thermal conductivity of the rocks shows a decaying trend and the values at 150 °c range from 5.7% to 8.7% lower than those at room temperature, revealing that the inﬂuence of temperature on the thermal conductivity of the tested rocks is limited. in addition, the thermal conductivity of the rocks increases with increasing compression stress in a nonlinear behavior, and the increase rate of the thermal conductivity increases with an increase of rock porosity. it is found that the effects of compression stress and water saturation on the magnitude of thermal conductivity of the rocks are basically comparable. based on the experimental data, the empirical models considering the inﬂuence of rock porosity have been established for predicting the temperature and compression stress dependent thermal conductivity characteristics of the rocks, and the predictions are found to be in good agreement with experimental results. this study thus emphasizes importance of porosity on thermal conductivity measurements even for low porosity crystalline rocks.  when the pores and cracks in the rocks tend to close during compression, quartz content may determine the thermal conductivity, and there exists an increase of the thermal conductivity with increasing quartz content. this is because the closure of pores and cracks increases the contact opportunity of quartz grains, and hence improves the transportation capability of heat ﬂow in the rocks. while the test results provide insights into the thermal conductivity characteristics of beishan granitic rocks, one should be aware of the limitation of this study. because the thermal conductivity of granitic rocks is inﬂuenced by many factors. in order to better understand the thermal conductivity of granitic rocks related to rock characteristics such as rock fabric, grain shape, grain contact and grain size, comprehensive petrographic investigations are recommended in the future. in the meantime, studies should be carried out to understand how the interactions between mineral components affect the thermal conductivity. work is also being conducted to investigate the thermal conductivity of the rocks under coupled thermal-hydro-mechanical conditions.  acknowledgments  this work has been supported by the china atomic energy authority through the

tectonic regions is mainly controlled by permeability of fault zones. therefore, the characterization of fault zones is an important step toward performance assessment of a reservoir. the ﬂuid ﬂow is controlled also by pressure and temperature conditions. in this context, we simulated pressure and temperature ﬁelds to elaborate on the inﬂuence of permeability on subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow in the lahendong geothermal reservoir. thermal–hydraulic simulation is performed using a ﬁnite element approach. adjusting the permeability through 370 different cases, modeling results converged to the observed data within a misﬁt range of 0–7 %. the best ﬁtting models identiﬁed a deep-seated fault that has previously not been traced at the surface. simulated temperature distribution suggests a prominent convective heat ﬂow, driven by an upward migrating and sw–ne oriented ﬂuid ﬂow. this hydraulic gradient causes a pressure drop along the reservoir. highpressure patterns are used to constrain recharge areas, in addition to inﬁltration measurements. discharge ﬂow occurs from sw to ne migrating also upward toward the hot springs. in that frame, thermal–hydraulic simulations

engineering \\x01 pressure drop  introduction  it  geothermal energy is an essential component to supply future energy demands. requires developing new geothermal sites and improving the performance of existing systems to satisfy continuously growing demand. the productivity of a geothermal ﬁeld mainly depends on subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow, which in active tectonic regions is controlled by permeability of fault zones (moeck 2014). in that frame, the primary focus is on locating and characterizing faulted areas in geothermal ﬁelds. this study employs numerical modeling to allocate and quantify permeability anisotropies and discontinuities, e.g., faults, in order to understand their inﬂuence on subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow in geothermal reservoirs.  numerical models have been increasingly used to understand the setup and productivity of geothermal systems. a general overview of geothermal models has been given by o’sullivan et al. (2001). additionally, there are several sites exemplifying similar characteristics as in lahendong. the underground movement of hot and cold ﬂuids has been modeled for geothermal ﬁelds in new zealand (kaya et al. 2014). the kakkonda geothermal site, e.g., consists of two reservoirs at various depths with different ﬂuid properties. there, results from ﬂuid ﬂow analysis show the importance of fractures for ﬂuid transport enhancing the recharge or discharge in the reservoir  123  \\x0c1088 page 2 of 11  environ earth sci (2016) 75:1088  (mcguinness et al. 1995). generally, faults acting as preferential ﬂuid path ways signiﬁcantly change the pressure and temperature ﬁeld in the reservoir (cherubini et al. 2013). models for the seferihisar–balc¸ova ﬁeld focus on the ﬂuid ﬂow inside of faults. results show an enhanced upward heat transport through ﬂuids from bottom of the geothermal system (magri et al. 2011).  our test ground is the lahendong geothermal ﬁeld located in sulawesi, indonesia. the ﬁeld is owned and operated by p.t. pertamina geothermal energy and hosts a power plant with a production capacity of 80 mwe. there, geothermal exploration started in the early 1970s including geophysical and geohydrochemical approaches. it is a water-dominated magmatic structurally controlled system. faults generally act as across-fault ﬂuid barriers and alongfault ﬂuid conductors (brehme et al. 2014). as a result, hot springs mainly appear on the top of vertically permeable faults at the surface. available numerous drilling and surface measurements allowed a detailed characterization of the geological and hydrogeological setting of the area (fig. 1; brehme et al. 2011, 2013, 2014, 2016; wiegand et al. 2013). the model presented here is developed for investigating subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow and the permeability distribution including the fault zones in the lahendong geothermal ﬁeld. below, the geological structure of the  ﬁeld is presented followed by an introduction to the modeling approach.  detailed investigation of subsurface permeability distribution is a crucial step for site selection and smart drilling strategies. the numerical simulations presented will provide insight into understanding the subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow considering the hydraulic conductivity of faults. it ensures productive as well as sustainable operation of geothermal ﬁelds avoiding risks, such as drilling into non-fractured or cold zones, and targeting highly corroding waters. although the target area is lahendong, the general workﬂow is applicable for other geothermal sites consisting of similar constraints.  reservoir characterization  hydrogeology  the overall driving force for the ﬂuid ﬂow is the sw–ne oriented natural hydraulic gradient in the lahendong geothermal system. the direction of ﬂuid ﬂow varies through the geothermal site due to horizontal partitioning of the reservoir by relatively less permeable fault zones (brehme et al. 2014). the basic sections are located in the  fig. 1 topographic map of the study area with geological features, water and rock sample locations, and model cross section  123  \\x0cenviron earth sci (2016) 75:1088  page 3 of 11  1088  south, in the east, and beneath lake linau. beneath lake linau, the direction of ﬂuid ﬂow is slightly rotated to wsw–ene (fig. 1). also, types of ﬂuid change from one section to another, e.g., an acidic highly saline-type beneath lake linau and a neutral low saline-type south and east of lake linau (fig. 1). the impermeable structure across faults prevent the ﬂuids from diluting each other (brehme et al. 2016). however, faults are rather permeable along the vertical axis, which allows recharge of the system through the faults. rainwater inﬁltrates at a fault in the sw, at mt. lengkoan, and creek water inﬁltrates into the normal faults at lake linau (fig. 2). the hydrothermal system discharges into lake linau and toward the ne, as driven by the hydraulic gradient (brehme et al. 2014).  the fracture network along the area is characterized by strike slip faults and normal faults. the sinistral faults strike n 40° and steeply dip toward the se. left step over on the strike slip faults forms an extension basin in the central study area. normal faults at the extension basin strike nw and dip 70°–80° beneath lake linau (brehme et al. 2014).  lithology  lahendong area is mainly characterized by pre-, postand tondano formation of plioto pleistocene age (koestono et al. 2010). the rocks are typically andesite, volcanic breccia, and tuff. those types have been sampled from borehole cores and used to determine porosity, permeability, and thermal conductivity. effective porosity and matrix permeability have been analyzed using a cylindrical-shaped  specimen with a dimension of 5 cm x 5 cm 9 2.5 cm oriented parallel to the coring (brehme et al. 2016). thermal conductivity has been measured on plain sections of dried cores. the experimental setup consists of a gas permeameter for determining matrix permeability (milsch et al. 2011), of an helium pycnometry for effective porosity measurements (johnson-maynard et al. 1994) and of an optical scanner for thermal conductivity measurements (popov et al. 1999). these parameters have been measured and averaged for the three rock types (brehme et al. 2016;

(2014).  is parallel  it  the numerical  the mesh used for  simulation in feflow consists of 45,264 nodes and 89,320 elements that are denser surrounding the faults because of expected gradients due to parameter contrasts. material properties of  123  elements are permeability, porosity, and thermal conductivity and set according to laboratory measurements (table 1). however, properties of the faults and lake linau are slightly adapted to speciﬁc conditions. the definitions for the modeled grids along the faults are as follows: porosity is 30 % and thermal conductivity is 1.8 w m-1 k-1. corresponding grids for lake linau are deﬁned by a porosity of 100 % and a thermal conductivity of 0.6 w m-1 k-1. the model simulates ﬂuid ﬂow and thermal transport in saturated media in steady state.  initial values and boundary conditions  fluid ﬂow boundary conditions in the model describe groundwater heads and recharge amounts (table 2; fig. 2). the hydraulic head at the sw model boundary is 837 m and 500 m at the ne boundary. the sw hydraulic head represents inﬁltration of surface water into a fault, striking perpendicular to the model. hydraulic head at the ne border is adapted to borehole measurements in that area (brehme et al. 2014). inﬁltration into the fault zones at lake linau is described by ﬂuid ﬂux boundary conditions. the quantity is 3.0 9 10-4 m s-1 the sw and 1.3 9 10-6 m s-1 at the ne fault distributed over 40 m fault width. groundwater recharge is set to 412 mm a-1 at the ne top surface (table 2; fig. 2). fluid movement in  for  \\x0cthe model domain is constrained by no-ﬂow boundary at the bottom, recharge through the surrounding fault zones, and the low hydraulic heads in the ne model area. discharge of the system in the central study area is mainly toward lake linau and across the ne model boundary. initial hydraulic head for the whole model domain is 500 m.  the heat  is 116 °c km-1 at  transport boundary conditions are time-invariant, ﬁxed temperatures, and heat ﬂux (table 2; fig. 2). thermal gradient the sw model boundary, and the temperature is constant 350 °c at the pluton. temperature of water inﬁltrating into faults and here mixing with shallow warm groundwater is 70 °c, while surface groundwater recharge is at 28 °c. temperature values are obtained from ﬁeld and bore log measurements (brehme et al. 2014). heat ﬂux is set to 100 mw m-2 at the bottom model boundary (table 2; fig. 2). this value is ﬁxed based on the studies from delisle et al. (1998), nagao and uyeda (1995), and neben et al. (1998). initial temperature for the model domain is set as 116 °c km-1, according to the local thermal gradient.  permeability determination  initial values for permeability are deﬁned based on laboratory measurements (table 1). after each simulation run, modeled and measured temperature and pressure values have been compared at indicated observation points. in case of poor matching (errors [10 %), permeability has been adjusted until satisfactory results have been achieved. beneath lake linau, simulation results showed locally strong discrepancies between modeled and measured pressure and temperature (errors [45 %). adjustment of permeability in geological inﬁltration rates into faults, or hydraulic heads did not lead to acceptable results. only the implementation of strong permeability anisotropy throughout whole depth, i.e., an additional fault, resulted in minimization of errors (0–7 %). implementation has been accomplished by mesh adaptation to ensure appropriate behavior around the fault. by this procedure, permeability anisotropies have been located and characterized in detail throughout the model.  layers,  in general, deﬁning a direction-dependent permeability improves the data ﬁt rather than using similar permeabilities in all directions. this is probably due to the fractures increasing the permeability mostly in vertical direction.  porosity and thermal conductivity remained constant throughout simulation. variation in porosity is negligible because it would directly be reﬂected in permeability, while thermal conductivity differences would only affect conductive heat transport, which is not dominant in the lahendong area (ondrak et al. 1998; brehme et al. 2014).  123  100c  measurementa  500borelog  ofmodel bottom  boundary

performed to obtain the best ﬁt to the measured data changing the absolute and relative permeability in geological elements. relative permeability refers to different permeabilities in horizontal and vertical direction. as a main result, a blind fault has been recognized beneath lake linau, which has not been known from former studies. simulated pressure and temperature are measured at ﬁve selected observation points, which represent boreholes with available bore logs for pressure and temperature. details on data are given in fig. 6. the model with best data ﬁt, out of 370 different models, is considered to generate the ﬁnal model developed for lahendong.  permeability distribution and identiﬁcation of a blind fault  distribution of permeability patterns in the reservoir has been conceived comparing temperature and pressure data in several wells. especially beneath lake linau, closely located wells show high variations in temperature and pressure. a drop of 100 °c and 18 bar along 300 m distance has been observed between well lhd 24 and lhd 28. models ﬁrst showed high discrepancies between modeled and measured values in this area. however, after implementing another high anisotropic permeable structure between the observation points, models resulted in satisfactory results. the structure has ten times higher vertical  environ earth sci (2016) 75:1088  permeability than horizontal permeability. this structure is assumed to be another fault zone located between two known faults with vertical dip and nw strike. this fault shows no trace at surface, because it is covered by lake linau.  generally, modeled permeability distribution in the lahendong reservoir is direction-dependent and overprints the lithology. modeled permeability is generally higher than measured ones in the order of up to four magnitudes. this is due to fracture patterns, which are not detectable at core-sample scale. permeability patterns directly affect subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow and temperature and pressure distribution.  permeability in the faulted zones and surroundings is lowest in the study area. especially the middle and ne fault, the shallow area beneath sw lake linau and the deep ne section of the ne fault show low permeabilities between 10-13 and 10-14 m2 (fig. 3). the area between the middle and ne fault, the deep section ne of the sw fault, the sw fault itself and the whole model area toward the sw and ne boundary show higher permeabilities of 10-10 and 10-12 m2 (fig. 3).  permeability varies not only within the modeled area, but also in vertical and horizontal direction. in faults and the deep reservoir section in the ne, permeability is by a factor of 10 higher in the vertical direction than in the horizontal direction (fig. 3). in the areas between faults, permeability is in some parts by a factor of 10–100 lower in the vertical direction. in the rest of the model, vertical and horizontal permeability do not differ (fig. 3).  fig. 3 final

suggests that convective heat transport is the dominating process in the reservoir rocks. isotherms generally follow the sw–ne oriented ﬂow pattern, the rise and the inﬁltration of ﬂuids. upwelling of isotherms between the faults veriﬁes water rise toward lake linau. inﬁltration of cold water causes down welling of isotherms particularly on the northeast section of the model. temperature is locally increased at the bottom of the model surrounding the pluton (fig. 4).  subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow  the absolute and horizontal/vertical permeability distribution controls local ﬂuid ﬂow in the lahendong reservoir.  the general ﬂuid ﬂow, driven by the natural pressure gradient, is oriented from sw to ne. vertical inﬁltration occurs at faults at lake linau and at the sw boundary. discharge is across the ne model boundary (fig. 5). the more detailed ﬂow patterns can be observed with streamlines, which show a ﬂuid ﬂow along highly permeable areas. calculated streamlines describe particle ﬂow within the model domain. a forward calculation shows how inﬁltrating water at the sw model boundary distributes through the reservoir. the backward calculation shows the source of ﬂuid particles arriving at the ne model boundary (fig. 5). patterns show that hot groundwater ﬂows toward the faults beneath lake linau, where the ﬂuid ﬂow is disturbed by a rise in temperature and vertically high permeable layers. this causes a rise of groundwater in this model area (red forward streamlines in fig. 5). at the same time, cold water inﬁltrates into high permeable areas and distributes over the ne model domain (blue backward streamlines in fig. 5). it is clearly seen that the composition of the ne reservoir domain is dominated by coldwater inﬁltration into faults, while the production areas are characterized by hot water ﬂow (fig. 5).  discussion  investigation of subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow in geothermal reservoirs is crucial for sustainable exploitation avoiding drilling into less productive areas. subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow might be locally inﬂuenced by fault zones or physical  123  \\x0c1088 page 8 of 11  environ earth sci (2016) 75:1088  fig. 5 model domain with calculated streamlines, in

water (i.e. viscosity). the inﬂuence of these parameters on the ﬂuid ﬂow has been investigated in lahendong geothermal reservoir using hydraulic–thermal simulations. simulation results show the detailed permeability distribution in the reservoir including location of an additional fault zone.  matching of measured and simulated temperature and pressure has been used as a tool for resolving the permeability distribution. temperature and pressure have been iteratively determined at several observation points (fig. 2). generally, modeled values are in good agreement with observed ones (fig. 6). nevertheless, some observation points give slightly different values for both pressure and temperature (lhd 4 and lhd 7) or only temperature (lhd 24). this is probably due to the complicated ﬂow processes or strong small-scale structural variation in fractured and faulted areas. furthermore, density variations, which could have not been included into simulation due to high temperatures, could cause variation of ﬂuid pressure. however, the average deviation of simulated pressure and temperature is 1 %.  implemented model parameters are porosity, permeability, and heat conductivity. from those parameters, only permeability has been tested in a speciﬁc range during simulation. the inﬂuence of porosity and heat conductivity on ﬂuid ﬂow is negligible due to dominating convective heat ﬂow (ondrak et al. 1998). values implemented in the model are based on measured permeabilities, which represent matrix permeability of rocks.  the measured matrix permeability, representing permeability in horizontal direction, is 1.5 9 10-14 m2 on  123  average, which remains within typical permeability range for fractured igneous rocks (schoen 2004). permeability for volcanic breccias ranges typically between 3 9 10-15 and 5 9 10-12 m2 and tuff permeabilities range between 7 9 10-17 and 7 9 10-12 m2 (klavetter and peters 1987). in the wairakei geothermal ﬁeld, simulating the impermeable layers resulted in permeabilities of 10-18 and 10-14 m2, in horizontal and vertical axis, respectively (mercer and faust 1979).  however, permeability in reservoir rocks might be locally increased due to fracture formation. it might also be decreased due to alteration and sealing in faults. in lahendong, modeled permeability can be up to four magnitudes higher than measured ones in faulted areas. this is caused by fractures, which are not detectable in core scale. moreover, in fault cores, it is by a factor of 10 higher in vertical direction than in horizontal direction. however, in areas between faults (fault gauge), permeability is in some parts by a factor of 10–100 lower in the vertical direction. adaptation of permeability ensures a ﬁt to measured temperature and pressure data.  permeability in fractured areas is the main factor inﬂuencing subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow and temperature distribution in the lahendong reservoir area. subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow is driven by local hydraulic heads, which show high variations at different sections of the study area. consequently, convective heat distribution leads to high temperature variation along the reservoir. these phenomena are observed in lahendong as well as comparable ﬁelds. in new mexico, water level drops of 30–100 m are observed across (haneberg 1995). high  several  fault  zones  \\x0c123  environ earth sci (2016)

al. (2014)  temperature drops and upwelling of isotherms indicate that fault zones control the ﬂuid ﬂow in the lake long and valentine ﬁelds, usa (hooper 1991). the analysis of ﬂuid pressure differences at the alpine fault, new zealand, allowed to characterize the change in permeability between hanging and footwall blocks (sutherland et al. 2012).  in summary, high pressure or temperature gradients are indicators for ﬂuid barriers between observation points. in other words, reservoir sections of different properties are separated by horizontally less permeable faults. in lahendong, most signiﬁcant ﬂuid barriers are faults to the sw and to the ne of lake linau. across these barriers, the pressure drops up to 20 bars. a similar pattern has been measured in bore logs beneath lake linau, where no surface trace of a fault had been observed in former studies. however, only by implementing another fault, modeled and measured values could have been adapted. the recently identiﬁed fault zone beneath lake linau remains under lake water and therefore is only traceable by this kind of reservoir modeling.  additionally to fault identiﬁcation, the internal structure of known fault zones has been understood in detail. the ne fault, i.e., shows a displacement at 2 km depth. the detailed trend has been understood by permeability adaptation in this area.  due to low permeability in horizontal direction in the faults, ﬂuids propagate mostly vertically toward the hot springs at surface. it also allows surface water to inﬁltrate into the reservoir in case the pressure within the fault zone is low enough (fig. 5). this vertical ﬂuid movement  eventually controls the temperature distribution in the reservoir. upward migration of deep hot water increases the temperature, while inﬁltration of cold surface water causes local drop of temperature.  in summary, the most important factors inﬂuencing the reliability of numerical reservoir models are absolute and different horizontal and vertical permeability. however, a permeability adaptation has been done for each geological layer; the vertical permeability anomalies are overprinting those layers and are constraining the regional groundwater ﬂow. those permeabilities of fractures directly inﬂuence the productivity of the reservoir (cherubini et al. 2013). therefore, their permeability characteristics should be investigated in detail.  in a previous study, a numerical model for the lahendong site has been set up in tough2 and aimed at forecasting the reservoir behavior during exploitation until the year 2036. with a production of 60 mwe, it predicts a pressure drop of 10 bars. however, the forecast results are uncertain due to lack of measured pressure draw down data (yani 2006). accordingly, the next steps of the presented study should include a realistic production and injection scenario in order reservoir exploitation. furthermore, chemical characteristics could be considered to achieve reliable production setups, because hydrochemical processes play an important role in the lahendong reservoir (brehme et al. 2016). presented models from this study provide important information on ﬂuid ﬂow in the water-dominated lahendong reservoir. however, additional the  two-phase ﬂow models of  to support  sustainable  \\x0c1088 page 10 of 11  environ earth sci (2016) 75:1088  lahendong area are in progress to understand the inﬂuence of steam driven ﬂuid ﬂow in this high-temperature system.  conclusion  the primary focus of this study is to understand the inﬂuence of fault zones and permeability patterns on subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow in geothermal reservoirs. the ﬂuid ﬂow mainly depends on rock and fault zone permeability. these processes have been considered in numerical models, which simulate local temperature and pressure conditions. the initial reservoir conditions, which refers to the case before production starts. models are developed based on the conceptual models of the study area, which explain reservoir geometry, geological structures, temperature, and hydraulic conditions. temperature and pressure well-logs have been used for model calibration.  the numerical

pressure signiﬁcantly drop across that ﬂuid barrier. this behavior has been observed in comparable ﬁelds in the usa as well. the overall shape of ﬂuid ﬂow direction trends in a sw–ne direction. main recharge occurs by inﬁltration of surface water into the faults, especially in the southwest and near to lake linau. discharge is enhanced in highly fractured areas toward lake linau. vertical permeability of faults allows ﬂuids rising toward the hot springs at surface.  results show that permeability has to be considered for simulation of a geothermal system. the geothermal system is mainly controlled by ﬂuid ﬂow in fractures/faults depending on temperature and pressure conditions. the locally modiﬁed ﬂuid ﬂow can considerably inﬂuence the productivity of a geothermal ﬁeld. results also guide reservoir management in case of a potential for ﬁeld extension, as performed in lahendong.  acknowledgments the authors acknowledge the continuous support within the team of the

keywords: geothermal  energy granite high  temperature stress-strain  response triaxial acoustic xrd  geothermal   heat   has   now   been   identiﬁed   as   an   effective   renewable   energy   source   due   to  severe   environmental   impacts   created   by   conventional   fossil   usage   on  global   climatic   change.   however,   its  wide application   has   been   limited   due   to   the   lack   of   knowledge,   particularly   of   the   geothermal   conditions   of reservoir   rocks   at   elevated   temperatures   and   pressures.   such   high   temperatures   and   pressures   possibly alter   the  mechanical   properties   of  reservoir   rocks   due   to   the   associated   micro-structural   and   mineralogical  alterations   of   the   rock   mass,   which   are   an   important   attribute   for   wellbore   stability   and   stimulation   of geothermal   reservoirs   for   safe  and   effective   geothermal   energy   extraction.   this   study   therefore   investigates   the   stress-strain   behaviour   under   in-situ   stress   and   temperature   conditions   by   conducting   a  series of  high-pressure,   high-temperature   tri-axial   experiments   on  australian   strathbogie   granite   under   four different  conﬁning   pressures   (10,   30,   60,   90   mpa)   and   four   different   temperatures   (rt,   100,   200,   300 ◦c). the  effect   of  temperature   on   the   mechanical   behaviour   of   rock   specimens   was   studied   under   tri-axial   conditions   and   the   corresponding   fracture   propagation   behaviour   was   observed   using   an   advanced   acoustic emission   (ae)   system.   the   corresponding   micro-structure   alteration   in   granite   was   observed   using   sem analysis.   according   to   the   ﬁndings,   increasing   temperature   leads   to  an   initial   increment   in   reservoir rock   strength   and   shear   parameters   followed   by   reduction,   and   the   trend   is   aligned   with   the   crack  formation   pattern   of   the  rock   mass.   this   was   further   conﬁrmed   by   the   sem   analysis,   according   to  which the   rock   micro-structure   is   subject   to  only   minor   changes   at   relatively   low   temperatures   and  higher temperatures   cause   micro-cracks   to   develop   along   the   rock   mass   grain   boundaries.   furthermore,   the conventional   mohr-coulomb   criteria   failed   to   model   the  stress-strain   response   of   rock   under   geothermal reservoir   conditions,   and   was   therefore   modiﬁed   for   the   corresponding   in-situ   conditions.  ©   2016   elsevier   ltd.   all   rights   reserved.  1.  introduction  geothermal  heat  has  been  identiﬁed  as  a

found  to  have  adequate  temperatures  to  serve  as  a geothermal  reservoirs  (fox  et  al.,  2013).  such  explorations  involve ﬁnding  vast  blocks  of  “hot  rocks”  with  fracture  systems.  such  rocks can  be  used  to  generate  electricity.  in  this  process,  water  is  ﬁrst injected  and  circulated  through  the  fractures  in  the  geothermal reservoirs  and  eventually  pumped  back  to  the  surface  as  steam. however,  the  exploration  of  geothermal  resources  has  become  a challenge  to  engineers  and  geologists,  due  to  the  high  temperature and  stress  environments  in  geothermal  reservoirs.  for  this  reason, laboratory  experiments  conducted  under  high  pressure  and  temperature  conditions  (geothermal  conditions)  can  assist  in  providing  \\x0cw.g.p.  kumari  et  al.  /  geothermics  65  (2017)  44–59   45  basic  predictions.  a  large  number  of  laboratory  experiments  has therefore  been  conducted  since  1970  to  investigate  the  inﬂuence of  high  pressure  and  temperature  on  rock  in  relation  to  geothermal heat  extraction  (siratovich  et  al.,  2016),  deep  geological  disposal  of nuclear  waste  (paquet  and  franc¸  ois,  1980),  deep  mining  (wawersik and  hannum,  1980)  and  geological  co2 storage  (dai  et  al.,  2014). the  mechanical  behaviour  of  reservoir  rocks  is  signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced  by  elevated  temperatures,  because  they  cause  the micro-structure  of  the  rock  mass  to  be  altered  through  thermal   expansion,  the  development  of  new  micro-cracks,  extending and/or  widening  the  existing  micro cracks  and  various  mineralogical  alterations.  rock  strength-deformation  criteria  change with  temperature,  and  some  rock  mechanical  properties,  such  as compressive  strength,  tensile  strength,  elastic  modulus,  cohesive strength  and  friction  angle,  decrease  with  increasing  temperature (heuze,  1983;  dwivedi  et  al.,  2008).  however,  such  alterations  are also  affected  by  the  conﬁnement  applying  on  the  rock  mass,  and conﬁning  pressure  causes  the  suppression  of  thermal  cracks  and the  extension/widening  of  existing  micro-cracks.  this  results  in further  alteration  of  the  rock  mass  mechanical  properties,  resulting  in  changing  failure  modes  (mogi,  1966).  studies  have  identiﬁed the  transition  of  rock  failure  mode  from  brittle  to  ductile  with increasing  conﬁnement.  however,  this  transition  is  diverse  due  to the  different  mineralogical  compositions  and  grain  boundaries  in different  rocks  (klein  et  al.,  2001;  wong,  1982).  although  many  studies  have  been  conducted  to  investigate  the temperature-dependent  mechanical  behaviour  of  reservoir  rocks, most  experiments  have  been  conducted  in  unconﬁned  environments  (singh  et  al.,  2015;  shao  et  al.,  2014).  pre-heating  the specimens  to  the  corresponding  temperature  ranges  and  testing  at  room  temperatures  has  been  frequently  done  (bauer  and johnson,  1979;  xu  et  al.,  2008),  but  the  method  is  not  reliable, as  geothermal  reservoirs  experience  continuous  thermal  stresses. such  limitations  have  occurred  mainly  due  to  the  limited  number  of appropriate  test  facilities  available  to  simulate  the  stress  and  temperature  conditions  of  actual  geothermal  reservoirs.  although  some studies  have  analytically  and  numerically  evaluated  the  mechanical properties  of  rocks  under  high  temperatures  and  pressures  (chester and  higgs,  1992;  tian  et  al.,  2013;  vásárhelyi  et  al.,  2016),  to  date none  has  captured  the  stress-strain  behaviour  and  failure  criteria  of rocks  over  a  wide  range  of  conﬁning  pressures  and  temperatures, particularly  for  australian  granite.  however,  the  thermo-elastic response  and  appropriate  failure  criteria  are  essential  inputs  for many  engineering  applications  under  high  pressures  and  temperatures,  including  geothermal  extraction  applications.  this  study therefore  intends  to  ﬁll  this  gap,  and  it  is  hoped  it  will  make  an important  contribution  to  many  deep  underground  applications.  2.  methodology  2.1.  tested  material  granite  is  an  abundant  crystalline  rock  in  the  earth  with  medium to  coarse  grains  which  was  formed  as  a  result  of  the  slow  cooling of  magma.  granite  therefore  has  abundant  radioactive  elements (k,  th,  and  u).  such  elements  bring  elevated  geothermal  gradients to  deep  granite  reservoirs,  which  therefore  have  ideal  conditions as  geothermal  reservoirs.  the  mineralogical  composition  of  granite  mainly  consists  of  quartz,  feldspar,  plagioclase  and  biotite,  and small  amounts  of  muscovite,  amphibole,  hornblende  and  opaque (dwivedi  et  al.,  2008).  for  the  present  study,  samples  were  collected  from  the  strathbogie  batholith,  which  is  a  composite  granitoid  intrusion  body spreading  over  more  than  1500  km2 in  150  km  north-east  from melbourne  (fig.  1).  strathbogie  granite  is  a  high-level,  discordant  fig.  1.  sampling  location  of  strathbogie  batholith  in  central  victoria.  table  1 physical,  mechanical  and

be  observed  in  the  granite  specimen,  mainly  with quartz,  k-feldspar  and  plagioclase.  as  shown  in  fig.  3,  the  grain  size was  measured  from  a  thin  section  of  this  granite  and  found  to  be \\u242em  with  only  a  small  number mainly  in  the  range  of  0  mm–200  of  larger  grains  (>300  mm)   (shao  et  al.,  2014).  table  1  summarizes the  physical,  mechanical  and  petrographic  properties  of  the  tested strathbogie  granite.  in  addition,  an  xrd  analysis  was  conducted  to determine  the  mineralogical  composition  of  the  selected  granite and  the  result  is  shown  in  table  2.  as  the  table  shows,  quartz  is the  predominant  mineral  in  the  selected  granite  (50%),  followed  by 16%  of  sodic  and  intermediate  biotite  and  15%  of  plagioclase.  the mineralogical  composition  of  this  particular  granitic  composition is  representative  of  the  composition  of  the  majority  of  the  earth’s granites  (best,  1995).  all  the  physical  properties  in  tables  1  and  2  \\x0c46   w.g.p.  kumari  et  al.  /  geothermics  65  (2017)  44–59  fig.  2.

intrusion  testing  (porosity)  and  volume  and weight  measurement  (bulk  density).  2.2.  sample  preparation  sample  preparation  and  testing  were  carried  out  at  the  deep earth  energy  research  laboratory  (deerl)  in  the  civil  engineering  department  of  monash  university,  and  the  sample  preparation was  conducted  in  accordance  with  the  astm  standard  for  tri-axial compressive  testing  (astm  d7012-10  (2010)).  in  order  to  maintain consistency,  all  the  samples  were  cored  to  22.5  mm  in  diameter using  the  same  block  of  granite  at  the  same  orientation.  during  the sampling  great  care  was  taken  to  obtain  samples  with  the  same crystalline  orientation,  and  samples  with  different  crystalline  orientation,  internal  layers  and  visible  cracks  were  discarded.  it  should be  noted  that  coring-induced  rock-microstructure  alteration  is  an important  aspect  to  consider  in  laboratory  experiments,  although few  studies  have  considered  this  effect.  to  avoid  such  issues,  a  very small  coring  rate  was  adopted  and  water  was  used  as  a  lubricant. the  cored  specimens  were  then  cut  into  45  mm  high  cylinders  and both  ends  of  the  specimens  were  ground  to  produce  two  parallel surfaces  perpendicular  to  the  axes  of  the  cylindrical  specimens.  2.3.  experimental  procedure  tri-axial  experiments  were  conducted  on  samples  under  four different  conﬁning  pressures  (10,  30,  60  and  90  mpa)  and  four different  temperatures  (rt,  100,  200,  300 ◦c).  these  experimental  conditions  were  selected,  because  the  most  preferable  hot  dry rock  systems  are  generally  located  at  depths  of  2.5–3.5  km  and have  around  70  mpa–120  mpa   conﬁning  pressures  (assuming  the reservoir  rock  density  is  equal  to  2500  kg/m3)  and  temperatures  of  200–350 ◦c  (breede  et  al.,  2013).  the  different  conﬁning  pressures and  temperatures  were  selected  to  simulate  the  reservoir  depth effect  and  to  obtain  a  sufﬁcient  data  set  to  understand  the  failure criteria  under  different  temperatures.  the  complete  arrangement  of  the  tri-axial  cell  is  shown  in fig.  3.  the  prepared  sample  was  ﬁrst  placed  inside  the  cell  and  the required  conﬁning  pressure  was   then  applied  using  a  silicon  oil  system,  and  an  annealed  copper  sleeve  was  used  to  isolate  the  sample from  the  conﬁning  liquid  (refer  to  fig.  3(b).  a  mica-insulated  metal band  heater  was   used  to  heat  the  pressure  cell  and  consequently the  rock  sample.  the  temperatures  of  the  cell  were  adjusted  using  a controller  and  a  constant  small  heating  rate  of  2.5 ◦c/min  was  used to  prevent  micro-structural  damage  due  to  sudden  thermal  shocks. two  separate  thermocouples  were  used  to  achieve  precise  temperature  control,  and  the  reading  of  the  thermocouple  installed  inside the  cell  (fig.  3(b))  was   recorded  by  the  data  acquisition  system.  the other  thermocouple  that  was   attached  to  the  barrel  (fig.  3(a))  was used  to  control  the  band  heater.  furthermore,  the  barrel  and  the top  of  the  pressure  cell  were  covered  using  an  insulating  blanket to  reduce  heat  loss  during  the  experiments  and  to  minimise  the inﬂuence  of  air  ﬂows  towards  the  cell.  all  the  tests  were  started once  the  system  had  achieved  a  steady  state  to  ensure  uniformity in  temperature  and  pressure  across  the  sample.  equilibrium  was ensured  by  monitoring  the  conﬁnement  pump  volume  and  the thermocouple  readings  inside  the  cell  (located  very  close  to  the specimen).  under  steady-state  conditions,  constant  pump  volume and  constant  temperature  were  observed  and  testing  was   initiated. a   constant  loading  pump  ﬂow  rate  of  1  ml/min  was  adopted  for all  the  test  specimens  and  the  converted  displacement  rate  was 0.05  mm/min.  it  should  be  noted  that  a  small  shaft  resistance  exists as  a  result  of  the  sealing  of  the  hydraulic  cylinder,  and  this  effect was  considered  in  the  calibration  of  the  loading  cell.  the  sealing resistance  was  obtained  by  measuring  the  pump  pressure  to  initiate  a  movement  in  the  loading  shaft,  and  this  was   deducted  from each  pressure  reading  to  eliminate  the  resistance  of  the  sealing  dur\\x0cw.g.p.  kumari  et  al.  /  geothermics  65  (2017)  44–59   47  using  the  typical  mohr-coulomb  brittle  deformation.  the  deviatoric stress-strain  plots  of  the  granite  samples  (fig.  4)  exhibited  concave upward  curvilinear  trends  from  initial  loading  to  the  peak  value, beyond  which  strain  softening  occurred,  causing  a  rapid  stress  drop to  a  residual  value.  increasing  peak  stress  with  increasing  conﬁning  pressure  can  be  observed,  which  is  to  be  expected,  according to  typical  mohr-coulomb  type  brittle  failure  (paterson  and  wong, 2005).  traditionally,  rock  failure  in  compression  can  occur  in  two main  ways;  (a)  dilatancy  and  failure  by  strain  softening  under relatively  low  conﬁning  pressures  and  (b)  failure  by  strain  hardening  under  elevated  conﬁning  pressures,  and  a  transitional  regime may   be  observed  at  intermediate  pressures.  these  transitional  failure  modes  have  been  referred  to  as  “quasi-brittle”,  and  complex localized  features  such  as  conjugate  shear  bands  can  be  observed under  such  conditions  (klein  et  al.,  2001;  gajo  et  al.,  2004).  by visual  inspection  of  the  post-failure  samples,  important  information  about  the  alteration  of  the  granite  failure  mechanism  with conﬁning  pressures  and  temperatures  can  be  identiﬁed.  postfailure  images  (fig.  5)  were  therefore  collected  after  each  test.  according  to  the  post-failure  images,  specimens  that  failed at  10–60  mpa   conﬁning  pressures  mainly  failed  by  shear  localization  along  an  inclined  macroscopic  shear  band  with  a  single shear  zone  across  each  sample.  however,  samples  tested  at  higher conﬁnements  of  90  mpa   and  120  mpa   (at  100 ◦c)  exhibited  strain hardening  characteristics  after  achieving  the  peak  stress,  and  several  conjugate  shear  bands  could  be  observed  on  the  cylindrical sample  surface,  instead  of  the  single  shear  band  observed  earlier. this  characteristic  was  signiﬁcant  at  120  mpa   conﬁning  pressure. however,  it  should  be  noted  that  only  one  test  was   conducted at  120  mpa   conﬁnement,  because  at  such  high  conﬁning  pressures  the  corresponding  failure  load  of  granite  exceeds  the  bottom pedestal’s  load-bearing  capacity.  further,  a  progressive  reduction was  observed  in  the  failure  plane  angle  with  respect  to  the  minor principal  stress  direction  with  increasing  conﬁning  pressure,  which implies  a  reduction  in  friction  angle,  possibly  due  to  the  greater quasi-brittle  behaviour  that  was   shown  by  granite  samples  at higher  conﬁning  pressures  (wong  et  al.,  2001).  3.2.  effect  of  temperature  and  conﬁning  pressure  on  mechanical properties  of  strathbogie  granite  fig.  6  illustrates  the  inﬂuence  of  temperature  on  the  deviatoric stress  of  the  tested  granite  under  each  conﬁnement.  as  the  ﬁgure  shows,  the  inﬂuence  of  conﬁnement  is  more  signiﬁcant  than that  of  temperature  in  the  temperature  range  considered  here. wong  and  brace  (1979)  conﬁrm  that  at  lower  conﬁning  pressures considerable  thermal  cracking  occurs  at  relatively  low  temperatures.  if  thermal  cracking  is  responsible  for  the  reduction  in  failure strength,  a  sharp  reduction  in  deviatoric  stress  with  increasing temperature  (with  suppression  of  thermal  cracks)  should  be  exhibited  under  unconﬁned  pressure  condition.  however,  based  on  the experimental  results,  under  unconﬁned  conditions,  up  to  100 ◦c, 17.6%  of  increment  in  deviatoric  stress  is  followed  by  2.5%  and 10.5%  reductions  at  200 ◦c  and  300 ◦c,  respectively.  however,  when conﬁnement  was  applied,  strength  reduction  was  initiated  after   higher  temperature  of  200 ◦c,  mainly  due  to  the  inhibition  of a thermal  cracks  by  induced  compressive  force.  thermal  cracking  is therefore  an  important  strength  property  alteration  mechanism  in reservoir  rocks  under  certain  conﬁning  pressure  conditions.  a    clear  inﬂuence  of  temperature  on  deviatoric  stress  at  any depth  or  conﬁnement  can  be  observed,  and  increasing  the  temperature  from  room  temperature  to  200 ◦c  causes  an  increment  in deviatoric  stress,  and  further  increasing  of  temperature  to  300 ◦c causes  a  slight  reduction  in  it.  this  is  because  the  thermal  expansion which  occurs  with  increasing  temperature  causes  the  reduction

resistance  is  negligible  which  is  only  0.19% of  maximum  measurement.  during  the  load  application,  the  axial strain  was  measured  using  linear  variable  differential  transducers (lvdts)  attached  to  the  ram  of  the  load  cell  (fig.  3(a)).  an  acoustic  emission  (ae)  system  was  also  employed  in  the  testing  of  samples  to  record  the  data  related  to  the  fracturing  process. the  ae  system  adopted  was  a  peripheral  component  interconnection  (pci)  system  with  a  nominal  resolution  frequency  of  500  khz. during  the  experiments,  two  sensors  were  attached  to  either  side  of the  loading  shaft  and  with  the  external  ampliﬁers,  which  generated low  frequency  acoustic  waves  with  the  fracturing  of  the  sample.  in addition,  possible  micro-structural  and  mineralogical  changes  that occurred  during  thermal  and  conﬁnement  effects  were  checked using  sem  analyses.  3.  results  and  discussion  3.1.

pressure.  the  reductions  of  strength  characteristics  were relatively  small  up  to  500 ◦c  and  beyond  that  an  accelerated  downward  trend  was  identiﬁed.  furthermore,  wider  localized  zones were  observed  at  high  temperatures  in  the  post-failure  images. however,  these  studies  were  conducted  at  wider  temperature ranges  (up  to  700 ◦c  and  900 ◦c,  respectively)  and  the  researchers therefore  did  not  pay  close  attention  to  reservoir  rock  behaviour under  relatively  low  geothermal  temperature  ranges  (<300 ◦c).  this was  the  focus  of  the  present  study,  according  to  which  there  is an  initial  strengthening  and  stiffening  in  granite  with  increasing temperature  at  low  temperatures  (up  to  200 ◦c),  and  increasing the  temperature  beyond  a  certain  value  causes  a  gradual  reduction  in  failure  stress  with  increasing  temperature.  elastic  modulus is  an  important  mechanical  property  of  any  reservoir  rock,  and  describes  the  brittle  characteristics  of  the  rock  mass.  it  is  therefore often  used  to  evaluate  many  in-situ  stress  applications,  including wellbore  stability,  fracturing  possibility  and  tectonic  stress  distribution  (heard  and  page,  1982).  the  temperature-dependent  brittle properties  (elastic  modulus)  of  the  tested  granite  were  then  evaluated.  the  elastic  region  of  each  stress-strain  curve  was  used  to calculate  the  temperature and  pressure-dependent  young’s  moduli  (e)  and  the  results  are  shown  in  fig.  7.  the  axial  strain  was measured  using  lvdts  attached  to  the  loading  ram  with  a  linearity ±0.1%  f.s  (full  scale)  (±0.0075  mm)   and  inﬁnite  resoluerror  of  tion  (no  hysteresis).  an  increment  of  the  modulus  of  strathbogie granite  with  increasing  temperature  up  to  200 ◦c  can  be  observed, and  further  increase  of  temperature  (to  300 ◦c)  causes  the  elastic modulus  to  be  slightly  reduced  for  any  conﬁnement.  this  trend  is  \\x0ca  ‘brittle’  or     general  increment  in  elastic  modulus  with  increasing  conﬁnement  can  be  observed  until  90  mpa,  and  a  further  increase of  conﬁnement  (to  120  mpa)  reduces  the  young’s  modulus  considerably.  with  increasing  conﬁning  stress  additional  plastic deformation  occurs,  exhibiting  strain-hardening  characteristics  in granite  under  high  conﬁnements.  however,  within  the  range  of the  experiments  conducted  (10  mpa–120  mpa)  it  cannot  be  deﬁnitively  identiﬁed  as  a  ’ductile’  regime.  however,  the strain-hardening  behaviour  observed  at  120  mpa   indicates  transitional  characteristics  and  this  can  be  identiﬁed  as  ‘quasi-brittle’ behaviour  (klein  et  al.,  2001).  the  initial  young’s  modulus  reduction  with  increasing  conﬁnement  was  observed  by  heard  and  page (1982),  who   conducted  tests  up  to  55  mpa   conﬁning  pressure.  however,  the  latter  behaviour  was  not  observed  by  these  researchers. interestingly,  according  to  the  research  literature,  at  low  temperatures  (<200 ◦c)  some  granite  types  are  more  temperature-sensitive, while  in  contrast,  some  granites  are  more  temperature-sensitive at  high  temperatures.  the  initial  strength  enhancement  is  more signiﬁcant  for  coarse-grained  granites  and  granodiorite  than  for ﬁne-grained  granites.  for  example,  according  to  heard  and  page (1982),  stripa  granite  is  more  sensitive  to  temperature  at  relatively  low  temperatures  (<200 ◦c),  and  westerly  granite  is  more sensitive  to  temperature  at  high  temperatures  (>200 ◦c).  such  contradictory  behaviours  may   occur  in  granite  due  to  the  different grain  size  distributions,  grain  orientations,  mineralogical  compositions  and  heterogeneity  of  different  granite  types.  this  indicates  the importance  of  studying  the  mineralogical  composition  and  microstructural  inﬂuence  of  granites  on  such  on  temperature-dependent strength  variations.  3.3.  effect  of  temperature  on  shear  strength  parameters  of strathbogie  granite  fig.  8  illustrates  the  variation  of  deviatoric  stress  of  the  tested granite  with  conﬁning  pressure  for  each  temperature.  the  ﬁgure shows  that  increasing  conﬁnement  causes  the  granite’s  deviatoric stress  to  increase  non-linearly  and  gradually  come  to  a  steady  state. this  is  consistent  with  similar  previous  studies,  which  have  clearly shown  the  enhancement  of  rock  strength  with  increasing  conﬁnement,  and  the  increasing  rate  is  reduced  with  increasing  conﬁning pressure  (barton,  2013;  singh  et  al.,  2011).  this  is  because  at  low conﬁning  pressures  there  is  a  high  dilation  potential.  therefore,  the ability  to  open  rock  micro-cracks  is  high,  resulting  in  higher  friction  angles.  however,  this  dilation  potential  and  the  corresponding tendency  for  micro-cracks  to  open  are  suppressed  with  increasing conﬁnement,  resulting  in  lower  friction  angles  at  higher  conﬁning  pressures.  therefore,  the  failure  mechanism  of  the  rocks  shifts from  brittle  to  ductile  with  increasing  conﬁnement,  changing  the shape  of  the  mohr-coulomb  failure  envelope,  and  according  to barton  (1976),  at  critical  conﬁning  pressure  the  mohr-coulomb  failure  envelope  reaches  a  zero  gradient.  this  has  also  been  shown by  hoek  (1983).  the  present  study  has  clearly  identiﬁed  this  rock behaviour  in  the  mohr-coulomb  failure  envelopes  developed  for each  temperature  condition  (refer  to  fig.  9).  according  to  fig.  9, the  traditional  linear  mohr-coulomb  criteria  are  applicable  only  in the  brittle  region  of  the  failure  envelope,  and  at  higher  conﬁnew.g.p.  kumari  et  al.  /  geothermics  65  (2017)  44–59  consistent  with  the  temperature-dependent  strength  behaviour  of the  granite  described  above.  the  reason  for  the  initial  elastic  module  increment  may  be  that  the  specimen  becomes  more  brittle  at the  initial  temperature  ranges  due  to  thermally-induced  volumetric  expansion  and  the  associated  pore  volume  reduction.  the  later slight  reduction  of  young’s  modulus  with  increasing  temperature exhibits  an  enhancement  in  ductile  behaviour  (quasi-brittle  characteristics)  with  further  increase  of  temperature.  this  is  possibly due  to  the  increased  crack  density  caused  by  the  induced  thermal crack  development  and  the  related  weakening  of  the  granite.  600  500

weakening  of  the  grain  boundaries,  dependent  on the  anisotropy  of  the  rock  matrix  (due  to  potentially  existing  distinct  mineral  compounds  in  granite  those  may   contain  different thermo-elastic  moduli  and  this  may   causes  to  generate  different  internal  stresses  with  heating).  according  to  wong  and  brace (1979),  increasing  the  temperature  causes  the  induction  of  thermal cracks  in  the  rock  mass  due  to  the  associated  generation  of  internal stresses  (eq.  (2)):  (2)  e(cid:4)˛(cid:4)t   =   \\u2434     where,  e,  \\x01␣,   \\x01t   is  the  matrix  young’s  modulus,  difference  of thermal  expansion  coefﬁcient  of  distinct  mineral  and  temperature difference,  respectively.  when  the  internal  stress  (given  by  eq.  (2)) exceeds  the  crack  closure  pressure  with  increasing  temperature, thermal  cracks  form  and  further  increase  of  temperature  provides the  surface  energy  required  for  the  propagation  of  the  initiated crack  (zuo  et  al.,  2007).  this  results  in  alteration  of  the  grain-tograin  contacts  in  the  rock  matrix,  which  leads  to  reduced  cohesion at  higher  temperatures.  in  the  case  of  the  variation  of  friction  angle with  increasing  temperature,  the  granite  friction  angle  appears  to remain  steady  up  to  around  100 ◦c  (52◦)  and  then  slightly  increases with  increasing  temperature  (54◦ at  200  and  300 ◦ c,  respectively). the  friction  between  grain-to-grain  contacts  may  be  altered  by the  thermally-induced  micro-structural  modiﬁcations.  however, this  effect  on  grain  contact  is  expected  to  be  smaller  at  relatively low  temperatures,  resulting  in  relatively  steady  friction  angle  with increasing  temperature  at  lower  temperatures.  however,  a  slight  ments  non-linearity  must  be  taken  into  account.  in  addition  to  the conﬁnement,  according  to  this  study,  increasing  temperature  also alters  the  failure  envelope  of  granite.  an  initial  increment  in  deviatoric  stress  with  increasing  temperature  can  be  observed  up  to 200 ◦c  and  further  increase  of  temperature  (to  300 ◦c)  causes  it  to be  slightly  reduced.  the  temperature-dependent  shear  parameters  of  granite  were investigated  next,  and  the  shear  parameters  can  be  obtained from  the  mohr-coulomb  failure  envelope.  as  suggested  by  singh et  al.  (2011),  the  mohr-coulomb  parameters  (cohesion  and  friction  angle)  were  calculated  using  eq.  (1),  taking  into  account  the linear  region  of  the  obtained  mohr-coulomb  failure  envelope  (considering  only  smaller  conﬁning  stresses,  up  to  30  mpa)  for  each temperature  condition  to  obtain  the  temperature-dependent  shear strength  parameters  (fig.  10).

(continued)  enhancement  in  friction  angle  with  increasing  temperature  can  be seen,  probably  due  to  the  increased  resistance  of  mineral  particles to  external  deformation  as  a  result  of  the  thermally-induced  energy in  the  mineral  particles.  however,  compared  with  cohesion,  the temperature  dependency  on  friction  angle  is  relatively  insigniﬁcant within  the  temperature  region  considered  here.  initial  enhancement  in  shear  parameters  in  sandstone  with increasing  temperature  has  been  observed  by  zhang  et  al.  (2015)  at relatively  low  temperature  regions,  and  these  researchers  observed   reduction  in  friction  angle  from  33.02◦ to  31.93◦ and  an  increment a in  cohesion  from  61.47  mpa   to  66.44  mpa   with  increasing  temperature  from  25 ◦c  to  100 ◦c.  further,  bauer  and  johnson  (1979) observed  around  10%  reduction  in  cohesion  and  40%  reduction  in friction  angle  in  westerly  granite  with  increasing  temperature  from room  temperature  to  300 ◦c,  and  friedman  et  al.  (1979)  observed   7%  reduction  in  cohesion  and  a  38%  reduction  in  friction  angle a with  increasing  temperature  from  room  temperature  to  400 ◦c and  300 ◦c,  respectively.  however,  the  variation  of  shear  strength parameters  with  increasing  temperature  at  relatively  low  temperatures  (<300 ◦c)  was  not  considered  in  the  above  studies.  the observed  initial  shear  strengthening  may   be  due  to  the  inhibition  of micro-crack  propagation  by  the  plasticity  mechanism  which  occurs at  crack  tips  (duclos  and  paquet  (1991))  at  low  temperatures.  with further  increment  of  temperature,  the  reduction  of  shear  strength parameters  can  be  expected,  due  to  the  thermal  weakening  of  the rock  micro-structure.  furthermore,  according  to  the  sem  studies conducted  by  zuo  et  al.  (2007),  large  local  plastic  deformations  and extremely  rough  cleavage  fractures  occur  at  relatively  low  temperatures.  moreover,  due  to  the  volume  expansion,  the  distance between  the  interfaces  of  the  individual  minerals  decreases  with the  enhancement  of  their  mutual  attraction,  and  the  strength  of the  bonds  increases  (dmitriev,  1972).  both  of  these  phenomena  can  be  considered  to  explain  the  stress  strengthening  of  granite  under relatively  low  temperatures  when  subjected  to  conﬁning  pressures.  3.4.  analysis  of  fracturing  behaviour  using  ae  technology  acoustic  emission  (ae)  detection  technology  is  a  powerful  nondestructive  tool  to  study  crack  propagation  processes  in  brittle materials,  including  the  stages  of  crack  initiation,  growth  and  crack damage  (lockner,  1993).  when  a  brittle  material  is  under  stress, strain  energy  is  released  during  the  development  of  new  cracks  or the  widening  of  existing  cracks.  this  energy  is  released  in  the  form of  elastic  stress  waves  from  the  crack  tips,  and  can  be  captured  and ampliﬁed  by  an  ae  system.  ae  detection  technology  has  therefore been  widely  used  in  a  number  of  previous  studies  to  understand the  crack  development  mechanism  in  brittle  materials  (chang  and lee,  2004;  lei  et  al.,  2000;  moura  et  al.,  2005).  by  incorporating  the  crack  propagation  pattern  into  the  stressstrain  relationship  of  the  cracking  material,  the  crack  development process  can  be  divided  into  several  stages.  hoek  and  bieniawski (1965)  divided  crack  formation  into  ﬁve  main  stages:  crack  closure,  crack  initiation,  secondary  cracking,  crack  coalescence  and crack  damage.  later,  ranjith  et  al.

(2015) incorporated  stress-strain  curves  into  cumulative  ae  counts/energy and  strain  plots.  in  the  crack  propagation  process,  with  the  gradual increment  of  loading  on  brittle  materials,  most  pre-existing  cracks are  ﬁrst  closed,  releasing  an  insigniﬁcant  number  of  ae  counts. this  initial  crack  closure  period  is  followed  by  the  stable  crack propagation  period,  which  can  be  identiﬁed  by  the  release  of  gradual  ae  energy  increments.  further  increment  of  loading  causes  an exponential  increase  in  ae  energy,  indicating  an  unstable  crack propagation  period  with  failure  approaching.  the  crack  closure threshold  ((cid:2)cc)  is  deﬁned  as  the  stress  threshold  at  which  the  initial ae  counts  are  identiﬁed.  anan  initial  increment  in  cumulative  ae  \\x0c54   w.g.p.  kumari  et  al.  /  geothermics  65  (2017)  44–59  counts  can  be  seen  at  the  crack  initiation  ((cid:2)ci)  threshold,  and  the cumulative  ae  counts  starts  exponential  growth  at  the  crack  damage  ((cid:2)cd)  threshold.  the  region  between  the  crack  closure  threshold and  the  crack  initiation  threshold  is  generally  deﬁned  as  the  stable crack  closure  region,  where  linear  elastic  deformation  occurs.  the region  between  the  crack  initiation  threshold  and  the  crack  damage  threshold  is  deﬁned  as  the  stable  crack  propagation  region,  and the  region  between  the  crack  damage  threshold  and  sample  failure is  identiﬁed  as  the  unstable  crack  propagation  region.  the  application  of  compressive  loading  fails  rocks  through  either shear  localization  (brittle  regime)  or  cataclastic  ﬂow,  and  the  surrounding  conditions,  such  as  temperatures  and  pressures,  may cause  a  homogenous  plastic  ﬂow.  according  to  existing  studies, axial  intra-granular  cracking  and  shear  rupturing  of  cemented  grain contacts  can  be  observed  before  failure  in  brittle  regimes,  and  grain crushing  and  pore  collapse  can  be  identiﬁed  before  failure  in  cataclastic  ﬂow  regimes  (menéndez  et  al.,  1996).  according  to  wong et  al.  (1997),  the  development  of  local  stress  concentrations  leads to  the  initiation  of  many  intra-granular  micro-cracks  in  the  rock mass,  and  the  crack  density  increases  with  increasing  deviatoric stress  and  tends  to  merge  on  reaching  the  peak  stress,  resulting  in strain  softening  and  shear  localization.  these  damage  processes  are clearly  identiﬁed  by  the  intense  ae  activities  in  the  ﬁeld  (chang  and lee,  2004).  ae  technology  was  therefore  used  to  investigate  the  progressive  fracturing  behaviour  in  strathbogie  granite  under  tri-axial conditions.  fig.  11  illustrates  the  cumulative  ae  events  with  axial stress  at  various  pressures  and  temperatures  for  the  tested  specimens.  the  corresponding  variations  of  deviatoric  stress  against strain  are  also  included  in  the  same  plots  to  identify  the  stress thresholds  for  crack  closure,  crack  initiation  and  crack  damage (table  4).  the  very  high  ae  counts  in  strathbogie  granite  at  dilatancy in  the  pre-failure  stage  are  due  to  the  fact  that  ae  waves  generate when  the  local  shear  stress  concentration  at  a  grain  contact  is  sufﬁciently  high  to  rupture  the  grain  boundaries,  and  frictional  slips and  grain  rotations  may   occur  once  the  grain  contacts  have  lost their  cohesion.  in  the  present  study,  crack  threshold  ratios  were  deﬁned  to  identify  the  temperature  and  pressure-dependent  crack  propagation  in the  tested  granite  as  follows,  and  fig.  12  shows  the  crack  propagation  stress  threshold  ratios  of  granite  specimens  tested  at  various conﬁning  pressures  and  temperatures.  crack  closure  stress  threshold   = deviatoric  stress  at  crack  closure  stress   deviatoric  stress  at  failure  ((cid:2)cc)  crack  initiation  stress  threshold   = deviatoric  stress  at  crack  initiation  stress   deviatoric  stress  at  failure  ((cid:2)ci)  crack  damage  stress  threshold   = deviatoric  stress  at  crack  damage  stress  ((cid:2)cd)  deviatoric  stress  at  failure  according  to  the  results,  the  beginning  of  crack  damage  occurs at  earlier  stages  of  deviatoric  loading  for  higher  conﬁning  pressures.  however,  the  crack  damage  stress  increases  with  increasing conﬁnement  due  to  the  inﬂuence  of  conﬁning  pressure  on  thermal crack  development  and  the  suppression  of  the  extension/widening of  existing  micro-cracks.  according  to  fig.  12,  in  the  temperature  range  considered  here,  three  tendencies  can  be  identiﬁed with  increasing  conﬁning  pressure:  increase  of  the  elastic  deformation  region,  decrease  of  the  stable  crack  propagation  region,  and increase  of  the  unstable  crack  propagation  region.  the  crack  initiation  stress  threshold  also  progressively  increases  with  increasing conﬁning  pressure,  which  can  be  attributed  to  the  fact  that  the brittle  behaviour  of  rock  specimens  at  lower  conﬁning  pressures changes  to  quasi-brittle  behaviour  with  increasing  conﬁning  pressure.  this  is  because  the  suppression  of  micro-crack  development is  less  at  low  conﬁning  pressures,  and  therefore  sudden  failures  mostly  occur,  and  the  beginning  of  crack  initiation  occurs  at  earlier  stages  of  deviatoric  loading  at  high  conﬁning  pressures due  to  the  higher  normal  stress  acting  on  micro-cracks,  resulting  in  limited  progression  of  cracking  before  failure.  in  relation to  the  temperature  effect,  increasing  the  temperature  causes  an initial  increment  in  the  crack  propagation  stress  threshold,  followed  by  a  slight  reduction  for  all  the  temperature  conditions considered.  for  example,  at  30  mpa   conﬁnement,  the  crack  damage  stress  threshold  ratios  increased  by  around  6.8%,  10.5%  with increasing  temperature  from  room  temperature  to  100  and  200 ◦c, respectively,  and  reduced  by  around  4.0%  when  the  temperature increased  to  300 ◦c.  this  implies  that  at  low  temperatures  a  suppressed  micro-crack  development  mechanism  is  dominant,  and increasing  the  temperature  causes  crack  damage  to  occur  at  earlier  loading  stages.  interestingly,  at  60  mpa   conﬁnement  the  crack damage  stress  threshold  ratio  increased  by  around  4.9%,  5.4%, 2.6%  with  increasing  temperature  from  room  to  100,  200  and 300 ◦c,  respectively.  this  exhibits  the  cumulative  effect  of  temperature  and  pressure  micro-crack  development  in  the  rock  mass. at  relatively  low  temperatures,  micro-crack  propagation  may  be inhibited  by  the  thermally-induced  plasticity  mechanism  which occurs  at  crack  tips  and  the  increased  bonding  strength  through thermally-induced  rock  matrix  expansion  (which  increases  crack stress  thresholds).  however,  further  increase  of  temperature  creates  thermally-induced  cracks  and  causes  the  grain  boundary cracks  to  widen,  resulting  in  early  crack  damage.  further,  with  the inﬂuence  of  conﬁnement,  micro-crack  development  is  suppressed, causing  a  relatively  low  increment  of  crack  damage  stress  threshold ratios  at  higher  conﬁnements.  3.5.  corresponding  alterations  in  granite  micro-structure  a    comprehensive  micro-structural  analysis  was   also  performed to  identify  the  interior  correspondences  of  the  above-described temperature-dependent  mechanical  behaviour  of  granite.  sem  and optical  microscopic  analyses  were  performed  on  thin  sections of  granite  specimens  at  various  temperatures:  room  temperature  (20 ◦c),  pre-heated  (72  hours)  to  200 ◦c  and  400 ◦c  (fig.  13). these  temperatures  were  selected  to  identify  the  microstructural behaviour  at  200 ◦c,  at  which  the  highest  strength  increment  was observed,  and  400 ◦c,  at  which  clear  thermally-induced  rock  mass weakening  was  observed.  a  specimen  at  room  temperature  was used  as  a  control.  based  on  optical  microscope  imaging,  mineralogical  assembling in  the  granite  specimen  could  be  identiﬁed  by  the  colour  and  texture  of  each  of  the  mineral  assemblages.  further,  a  detailed  sem study  was   performed  using  scanning  electron  imaging  (sei)  and bsei  back-scatter  electron  imaging  (bsei)  techniques.  bsei  images taken  at  low  magniﬁcations  clearly  show  different  mineral  assemblages  and  grain  boundaries  (see  fig.  14).  using  energy-dispersive x-ray  (edx)  technology  with  aztec  oxford  instruments,  chemical  component  mapping  was  generated  in  each  specimen,  and each  mineral  was  identiﬁed  qualitatively.  the  bright  colour  images observed  in  edx  images  indicate  higher  concentration  (higher energy  dispersion)  while  dark  colour  areas  indicate  lower  concentration  (lower  energy  dispersion).  based  on  the  spectrum  of  each point  (point  id),  the  corresponding  mineral  was  identiﬁed  and  a map   spectrum  provided  overall  elements  available  for  each  specimen.  according  to  figs.  13  and  14,  there  are  clear  mineralogical assembling  in  the  granite  specimens,  mainly  with  quartz,  kfeldspar  and  plagioclase.  the  heating  of  granite  up  to  200 ◦c temperature  has  not  caused  any  signiﬁcant  thermally-induced micro-cracks  (in  addition  to  the  pre-existing  faults  and  grain boundaries)  and  almost  all  grain  boundaries  remain  intact.  however,  further  heating  of  granite  to  the  higher  temperature  of 400 ◦c  caused  the  induction  of  some  micro-cracks,  mainly  along  \\x0cw.g.p.  kumari  et  al.  /  geothermics  65  (2017)  44–59   55  table   4 stress  thresholds  for  different  fracturing  stages.  temperature

have  been  partially  parted  and  a  signiﬁcant  number of  grain  boundaries  appear  to  remain  intact  up  to  this  temperature.  furthermore,  based  on  the  edx  mapping,  it  was   conﬁrmed that  intra-granular  cracks  are  mainly  initiated  along  the  feldspar and  quartz  minerals.  intragranular  cracks  were  mainly  observed in  larger  crystals  (crystals  greater  than  0.5  mm)   and  smaller  crystals  remained  un-parted  even  at  400 ◦c.  for  strathbogie  granite, thermally-induced  intra-granular  micro-cracks  seem  to  play  a  signiﬁcant  role  at  relatively  low  temperatures,  probably  due  to  the presence  of  relatively  high  k  feldspar  and  biotite  contents.  similar  observations  have  been  reported  in  bauer  and  johnson’s  (1979) study  conducted  for  charcoal  granite,  where  intra-granular  microcracks  predominantly  occur  compared  to  grain  boundary  cracks. the  sem  analysis  is  also  consistent  with  this  ﬁnding,  which  exhibits inhibition  of  micro-crack  development  followed  by  micro-cracking at  relatively  high  temperatures.  the  crack  propagation  process  in  any  rock  mass  is  largely inﬂuenced  by  the  mineralogical  composition,  because  cracks  normally  propagate  through  weaker  planes  of  the  rock  mass.  since granite  is  an  igneous  type  of  rock,  two  main  types  of  thermallyinduced  cracking  modes  can  be  identiﬁed:  inter-granular  and  intragranular.  the  amount  of  inter-granular  or  intra-granular  cracking is  dependent  on  the  stress  state,  rock  type  and  mineralogy  of the  rock  mass.  inter-granular  cracks  occur  along  grain  boundaries, pre-existing  faults  and  micro-cracks  of  the  rock,  while  intragranular  cracks  occur  through  weaker  mineralogical  constituents (kranz,  1983).  for  example,  k feldspar  and  biotite  are  weaker  mineralogical  constituents  due  to  their  large  crystals  (>10  mm), as  crystals  greater  than  2–3  mm  in  size  are  generally  deﬁned  as weaker  mineralogical  constituents  compared  to  equi-dimensional small  crystals  like  quartz  (homand-etienne  and  houpert,  1989). based  on  experimental  results,  intra-granular  cracking  is  highly temperature-dependent  due  to  the  temperature dependent  dislocations  in  the  rocks.  this  is  because  different  mineralogical components  have  different  thermo-elastic  moduli  and  thermal conductivities  (kranz,  1983;  dwivedi  et  al.,  2008).  these  observations  suggest  that  micro-cracking  in  granite  is highly  temperature dependent,  as  evidenced  by  the  previously observed  initial  strength  gain  followed  by  slight  strength  reduction  with  increasing  temperature  in  the  tested  granite.  however, this  shows  that  granite  needs  to  be  heated  to  a  sufﬁcient  temperature  to  cause  thermal  cracks  in  it  and  therefore,  heating  to  a  lower temperature  may   only  cause  a  strength  gain  through  the  thermal expansion  of  the  rock  matrix.  this  is  consistent  with  the  results of  bauer  and  johnson  (1979).  the  mechanical  properties  of  charcoal  granite  in  their  study  remained  relatively  steady  until  200 ◦c, and  westerly  granite  exhibited  a  signiﬁcant  thermal  dependency, even  at  relatively  low  temperatures  (<200 ◦c).  in  homand-etienne and  houpert  (1989)  study,  the  variation  of  uni-axial  compressive strength  of  both  semones  and  remiremont  granites  is  insigniﬁcant until  400 ◦c,  followed  by  signiﬁcant  reductions  at  higher  temperatures.  these  results  indicate  the  dependency  of  mineralogical composition  and  grain  size  distribution  on  the  temperature dependent  mechanical  behaviour  in  various  types  of  granites.  however,  \\x0cw.g.p.  kumari  et  al.  /  geothermics  65  (2017)  44–59   57  fig.  14.  bse  images  of  strathbogie  granite  with  edx  mapping:  (a)

granite  under  four  different  conﬁning  pressures  (10,  30, 60,  90  mpa)  and  four  different  temperatures  (rt,  100,  200,  300 ◦c), simulating  various  geothermal  reservoir  conditions.  the  following conclusions  can  be  drawn:   mechanical  behaviour  of  the  tested  granite  is  inﬂuenced  by  both reservoir  depth  and  temperature,  and  the  depth  effect  is  much greater  than  the  temperature  effect.   granite  located  at  relatively  smaller  depths  appears  to  fail through  shear  localization  and  increasing  depth  may  cause  this to  change  to  ductile  failure  through  strain  hardening.  a  progressive  enhancement  in  stress  threshold  with  increasing  conﬁning pressure  is  observed  in  strathbogie  granite.  such  behaviours exhibit  greater  strength  and  lower  brittle  characteristics  in  granite  located  at  greater  depths.   increasing  of  temperature  causes  granite’s  strength  to  be enhanced  up  to  a  certain  temperature  (around  200 ◦c  for  strathbogie  granite)  through  the  possible  thermal  expansion  of  the rock  matrix  and  further  increasing  of  temperature  may   cause  it to  weaken  by  inducing  thermal  cracks.  this  was  conﬁrmed  by the  micro-structural  analysis,  which  did  not  reveal  any  noticeable  amount  of  thermally-induced  micro-cracking  in  strathbogie granite  up  to  200 ◦c,  and  heating  of  the  granite  to  a  greater  temperature  as  400 ◦c  caused  many  intra-granular  cracks  in  quartz and  feldspar  and  some  grain  boundary  cracks  between  quartz  and feldspar  minerals.  furthermore,  according  to  ae  analysis,  increasing  the  temperature  ﬁrst  causes  the  crack  propagation  stress threshold  to  increase  and  further  increasing  of  the  temperature causes  it  to  be  slightly  reduced.  this  indicates  a  suppression  of micro-cracks  at  low  temperatures  by  matrix  expansion  and  the development  of  micro-cracks  through  thermally-induced  damage  at  higher  temperatures.   finally  an  attempt  was  made  to  improve  the  conventional  mohrcoulomb  failure  criteria  for  geothermal  reservoirs  with  extreme pressures  and  temperatures,  because  the  conventional  criteria are  not  applicable  to  extreme  conditions.  acknowledgements  this  research  project  is  funded  by

strength  criteria  are  available  for  intact rock,  the  practical  application  of  most  of  them  for  geothermal reservoirs  in-situ  model  parameters  required  when  considering  the  available  high-pressure  and high-temperature  environment  in  underground  reservoirs.  of  the various  failure  criteria,  the  mohr-coulomb  failure  criteria  have been  extensively  used  in  the  ﬁeld  and  have  made  a  signiﬁcant  contribution  to  the  determination  of  rock  mass  failure.  however,  they have  some  major  limitations,  including  ignoring  the  intermediate stress  (cid:2)2 inﬂuence  (which  has  been  proven  to  have  a  substantial inﬂuence  on  rock  strength)  and  the  assumed  linearity  (the  strength criteria  of  rock  are  non-linear  in  reality).  after  re-analyzing  thousands  of  reported  triaxial  experiments  and  combining  the  critical state  concept  proposed  by  barton  (1976),  singh  et  al.  (2011)  proposed  a  non-linear  mohr-coulomb  failure  criterion.  according  to the  ﬁndings  of  singh  et  al.  (2011),  the  mohr-coulomb  shear  strength parameters  should  only  be  obtained  by  performing  conventional tri-axial  tests  under  low  conﬁning  stresses  (in  the  linear  region  of the  mohr-coulomb  failure  envelope).  according  to  their  statistical analysis,  (cid:2)cc ≈   (cid:2)crit,  where  (cid:2)c and  (cid:2) crit are  uni-axial  compressive strength  and  critical  conﬁning  pressure,  respectively.  the  modiﬁed mohr-coulomb  failure  criterion  proposed  by  singh  et  al.  is  given below: (cid:2)1 −   (cid:2)3 = where,  (cid:2)ci ≈    (cid:2)ci + 2sin(cid:3)i0 sin(cid:3)i0   ucs  of  the  rock  =  2ciocos(cid:3)i0/1   sin(cid:3)i0,  (cid:3)i0 and cio are  friction  angle  and  cohesion  obtained  at  low  conﬁning  pressures.  sin(cid:3)i0) (cid:2)32  2sin(cid:3)i0  (cid:2)3 ≤  (cid:2)3 −  (cid:2)crit (1   for  0     (cid:2)crit  −   −   1     however,  even  the  improved  mohr-coulomb  failure  criteria cannot  be  directly  applied  to  geothermal  reservoir  rocks  at  extreme pressures  and  temperatures,  because  the  strength  response  is altered  by  the  thermal  effect  (heuze,  1983).  to  date,  no  extensive study  has  captured  this  thermal  response  in  the  improved  mohrcoulomb  failure  criteria.  such  a  realistic  approach  is  necessary for  deep  underground  engineering  applications  like  geothermal energy  extraction.  the  concepts  of  barton  (1976)  and  singh  et  al. (2011)  are  therefore  incorporated  into  the  temperature  inﬂuence in  this  study  and  an  attempt  is  made  to  propose  novel  strength  criteria  for  geothermal  reservoir  rocks  based  on  experimental  data:  + 2sin(cid:3)i (t)  sin(cid:3)i (t) (cid:2)3 −  −    1     −      (cid:2)3 (t) = 2ci (t) cos(cid:3)i (t) sin(cid:3)i (t)  1     (cid:2)1 −  (4)  (cid:2)3 ≤    (cid:2)crit  ≤   sin(cid:3)i (t)) (cid:2)32 for  0   −   (cid:2)crit (t)  (1   2sin(cid:3)i (t)  (7)  10−7t 3  ×     4.52   0.0002t 2 +  −   ×   −   ×   where,  (cid:3)i (t) ,  ci (t) and  (cid:2)crit (t) are  temperature-dependent friction  angle,  cohesion  and  critical  conﬁning  pressure  and  can  be given  as  follows: f1 (t) =  1.034  (cid:3)i (t) (cid:3)io ci (t) cio ccrit (t)  f2 (t) =  0.7795   0.0001t 2 +  10−8t 3(6)  10−5t 2 −  0.1504t   10−8t 3  0.0032t     2.22     7.62   (5)  3.53   =   +   ×   −   =   +     1.7887   0.0226t   +     f3 (t) = =  ucs  however,  it  should  be  noticed  that  the  modiﬁed  temperaturedependent  criteria  may   only  be  applicable  for  similar  types  of granites  under  the  tested  experimental  conditions.  58   w.g.p.  kumari  et  al.  /

wang, 2014). site selection for china's hlw repository started in 1985 (wang, 2010). the efforts have been focused on potential hlw repository sites located within granite intrusions in mainland china. since 1999, the beijing research ⁎ corresponding author. e-mail address: xingguang100@126.com (x.g. zhao). http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tecto.2016.06.021 0040-1951/© 2016 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved. institute of uranium geology (briug) has performed site characterization studies in the beishan area, china. so far, the beishan area has been considered as the most potential candidate area for china's hlw repository. among all the engineering properties of crystalline rocks at a potential hlw repository site, the thermal conductivity is one of the most important parameters in design consideration because it has a direct impact on the evaluation of the necessary repository volume and the optimization of the repository layout (sundberg and hellström, 2009). for instance, in the swedish kbs-3 concept for geological disposal of spent fuel, copper canisters with cast iron inserts containing the spent fuel are surrounded by bentonite for isolation and mechanical protection (brantberger et al., 2006). the heat generated by the spent fuel will increase the temperature of all components of the repository. for the bentonite buffer outside the canisters, the peak temperature must not exceed 100 °c. this requirement implies that the canisters cannot be deposited arbitrarily close to each other. on the other hand, unnecessarily large distances between the canisters will mean inefﬁcient and costly use of the repository rock volume (hökmark et al., 2009). to fulﬁll the temperature requirement, the rocks with low thermal conductivities will\\x0cx.g. zhao et al. / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137 125 lead to a larger distance between canisters than for a case with high thermal conductivities. this is because the rocks with low thermal conductivities will give rise to higher temperatures in the bentonite (sundberg et al., 2008). hence, to design and construct repositories successfully, it is essential to perform an accurate assessment of the thermal conductivity characteristics of the host rock. over the past few decades, various experimental approaches have been employed to measure the thermal conductivity of rocks. the results indicate that the thermal conductivity of rocks is closely associated with mineral composition, porosity, texture, and density, etc. (birch and clark, 1940; clauser and huenges, 1995; hartmann et al., 2005; özkahraman et al., 2004; pasquale et al., 2015; ray et al., 2007; sundberg et al., 2009). for crystalline rocks with relatively homogeneous texture and low porosity, the mineral composition dominates the thermal conductivity. in volcanic and sedimentary rocks, the high variability of porosity in these rocks is a major factor controlling the thermal conductivity (clauser and huenges, 1995; özkahraman et al., 2004). for example, increasing porosity, which acts as barrier to the ﬂow of heat, often results in both lower p-wave velocity and lower thermal conductivity values (özkahraman et al., 2004). for a given rock, water content and temperature have an inﬂuence on its thermal conductivity. generally, the thermal conductivity of the rock increases and decreases with increasing water content (cho and kwon, 2010; cho et al., 2009) and temperature (abdulagatova et al., 2009; birch and clark, 1940; heuze, 1983; miao et al., 2014; mottaghy et al., 2008; vosteen and schellschmidt, 2003), respectively. moreover, the effect of water saturation on the thermal conductivity of rocks shows a generally increasing trend with increasing porosity (nagaraju and roy, 2014). given that the thermal conductivity of surrounding rocks around the excavations will be changed by the excavation-induced stress, some researchers studied the inﬂuence of pressure on the thermal conductivity of rocks (abdulagatova et al., 2010; abdulagatova et al., 2009; demırcı et al., 2004; görgülü et al., 2008; sibbitt, 1976; walsh and decker, 1966; zimmerman, 1989). one of the main ﬁndings achieved from these investigations shows that the thermal conductivity varies with the pressure exerted on the rock. with increasing applied pressure, the thermal conductivity starts to increase and subsequently the increase rate tends to be a constant value due to gradual closure of cracks and pores within the rock (görgülü et al., 2008; walsh and decker, 1966). while the above-mentioned studies provide meaningful insight into the thermal conductivity of various rocks, the thermal conductivity characteristics of low-porosity crystalline rocks subjected to different external factors such as water saturation, temperature and compression stress have not been fully understood. on the other hand, the information on the thermal conductivity of rocks in a potential hlw repository site must be known with sufﬁcient conﬁdence to provide necessary input conditions for its long-term safety assessment, which is one of the motivations for this study. in this work, experimental investigations on the thermal conductivity of the beishan granitic rocks are conducted using the transient plane source (tps) method. in the following discussion, rock sampling and basic physical properties of the rock specimens are introduced ﬁrst. testing facilities and procedures are then described. subsequently, the water saturation, temperature and compression stress dependent thermal conductivity characteristics of the tested rocks are evaluated comprehensively, and ﬁnally some insights are obtained. 2. rock sampling and preparation the beishan area is situated in gansu province of northwestern china (see fig. 1). after a long geological evolution and weathering process, the topography of this area is characterized by a ﬂat gobi and small gentle rolling hills with elevations ranging between 1400 and 2000 m above the sea level. the crust in this area possesses a blocky structure with many granite intrusions (see fig. 2). other surrounding rocks include mainly metamorphic and sedimentary rocks, as well as quaternary cover. rock sampling was carried out in the jijicao and xinchang rock blocks, which are currently considered as two of the key investigation sub-areas during site selection and characterization. fig. 1. geographical location of the beishan area and a photo showing its typical topography.\\x0c126 x.g. zhao et al. / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137 xinchang bs06 bs18 bs19 jijicao bs16 bs15 bs05 n 2.5 km granitic rock sedimentary rock metamorphic rock quaternary cover borehole fault fig. 2. rock sampling from six boreholes in the jijicao and xinchang sub-areas for thermal conductivity measurements. intact drill cores with a diameter of approximately 63 mm were taken from six sub-vertical boreholes (i.e., boreholes bs05, bs06, bs15, bs16, bs18 and bs19) in these two sub-areas. the borehole locations are presented in fig. 2. field observations indicated that the collected granitic rocks were relatively isotropic in texture and mineralogical composition. to evaluate the geological nature of the rocks, a series of thin sections were prepared and then exposed to cross-polarized light under an optical microscope to identify the dominant minerals in the rocks. the percentages of the dominant minerals were determined by point counting on thin sections. for each thin section approximately 500 points covering phenocrysts and groundmass were counted. according to the quartz-alkali feldspar-plagioclase (qap) diagram (streckeisen, 1976), the rocks can further be classiﬁed. it can be observed from fig. 3 that the rocks contain mainly a moderate to low amount of quartz and alkali feldspar, and a moderate to high amount of plagioclase. this means that the collected rocks dominantly range from granodiorite to monzogranite. for grain size characteristics, the rocks are from ﬁne grained to, medium to coarse grained. an overview of the basic information of the rocks is listed in table 1. based on the borehole no. and sampling depth, these rocks have been divided into eight groups. a total of 47 pairs of rock specimens, 50 mm in diameter, were prepared from the drill cores with a length to diameter ratio of approximately 0.5. in particular, specimen ends were polished carefully using a q 90 90 i granodiorite ii monzogranite 60 60 ii i bs05 bs06 bs15 bs16 bs18-1 bs18-2 bs19-1 bs19-2 20 20 5 5 p 10 35 65 90 a fig. 3. qap classiﬁcation of the eight rock groups based on modal analysis. grinding machine until the ﬂatness and roughness of the ends are less than 10 μm and 3 μm, respectively. the ﬂat and polished specimen end surfaces minimize the thermal contact resistance during thermal conductivity measurement. a minimum of ten specimens for each rock group were prepared. 3. test methodology 3.1. an introduction to the used tps method in the ﬁelds of geology and geophysics, laboratory approaches to measuring soil and rock thermal conductivity can mainly be divided into two groups: steady state and transient state. in this work, the transient plane source (tps) method (gustafsson, 1991; log and gustafsson, 1995) was utilized to measure the thermal conductivity of the specimens. as one of the transient measurement methods, the tps technique is based on the use of a transiently heated plane sensor (i.e., hot disk sensor) and a hot disk thermal constants analyser (see fig. 4a). the used hot disk tps2500s system can measure thermal conductivity of materials ranging from 0.01 to 400 w/mk. the hot disk sensor consists of a continuous double spiral, which is etched out of a thin nickel foil (fig. 4e). this spiral is sandwiched between two sheets of electrical insulation materials made of kapton. the sensor acts both as a heat source for increasing the temperature of the specimens and as a dynamic temperature sensor for recording the temperature increase. during the measurement, the temperature in the sensor rises and heat starts to ﬂow to the specimens. the temperature rise in the sensor provides an indicator of the thermal properties of the specimens. if the specimens have good thermal conducting properties, the heat will be transported rapidly inside the specimens. on the contrary, if the specimens have good thermal insulation properties, the sensor temperature will rise faster and the heat will not be transported as much as in the test of the good thermal conducting specimens. compared with steady state measurement methods such as the divided bar (beck and beck, 1958; birch, 1950; sass et al., 1971) and the guarded hot plate (abdulagatova et al., 2009; alishaev et al., 2012), one of significant advantages of the tps technique is that the thermal conductivity of materials can be measured more quickly, typically from several to tens of seconds. hence, a long wait for thermal gradients to equilibrate is not required and the moisture migration in response to temperature gradients was minimized (jackson and taylor, 1986). on the other hand, unlike some transient methods such as thermal needle probes (barry-macaulay et al., 2013; von herzen and maxwell, 1959), which are commonly used for soils and soft rocks, the tps method can be\\x0cx.g. zhao et al. / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137 127 table 1 basic information and geological description of the tested rocks. rock type and group basic information mineral composition naked eye observation photomicrograph of a thin section monzogranite (bs05) location: jijicao borehole no.: bs05 sampling depth: 5–7 m number of specimen pairs: 7 grain size: medium plagioclase: 33.7% ± 5.8%;

popov et al., 2003). hence, the thermal resistance between the specimen ends and the sensor exists (see section 3.2). so far, the tps technology has been widely used to\\x0c128 x.g. zhao et al. / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137 a c temperature control system b hot disk thermal constants analyser sensor platen specimens d e specimens insulation material chamber sensor specimens oil bath sensor double spiral cable extension fig. 4. the hot disk tps2500s system (a) used to measure the thermal conductivity of specimens under room temperature (d), high temperature (c), and uniaxial compression (b) conditions. a hot disk sensor showing its key components (e). determine the thermal properties of different materials (lagüela et al., 2015;

θ ¼ a2=d where t is the time measured from the start of the transient recording, θ is the characteristic time, which depends both on parameters of the sensor and the sample, and d is the thermal diffusivity of the sample. according to eq. (2), and δtðτþ and d(τ) plotted as a function of τ provides a linear relationship with a slope that is a function of p0, a, and k. thermal conductivity k can be obtained by ﬁtting the experimental data to the straight line given by eq. (2); thermal diffusivity d is calculated from eq. (3) taking into account the τ value determined in the previous ﬁt. as mentioned above, the solution of the thermal conductivity equation is based on the assumption that the hot disk sensor is located in an inﬁnite material in perfect contact with the sensor surface. this means that the heat ﬂow generated from each measurement must not reach the outside boundaries of the specimen (hot disk, 2007). meanwhile, a careful preparation of specimen ends is required to minimize thermal contact resistance. an estimation of how far the heat ﬂow has proceeded in the specimen during a recording is the probing depth δp, which is deﬁned as (hot disk, 2007): ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ p dt δp ¼ 2 ð4þ to determine the thermal conductivity with good accuracy, the shortest distance from any part of the sensor to the nearest outside boundary of the sample should be larger than δp. in our experiments, the used hot disk sensor has a radius of 6.403 mm. the shortest distance is about 19 mm, and the probing depth is approximately 10 mm. for this probing depth value, we can consider that we are conducting a bulk measurement. 3.3. test procedures 3.3.1. tests on specimens under saturated and dry conditions firstly, the specimens were immersed by deionized water in a vacuum for a period of 96 h. the specimens were then taken from the vacuum and the water droplets on the surfaces were wiped dry, care being taken to ensure that no rock grains or fragments were lost. the mass of the water-saturated specimens (msat) was measured using a\\x0cx.g. zhao et al. / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137 129 loading

conductivity measurement. high precision balance (to 0.0001 g). our tests revealed that the mass of the specimens could be approximately constant under vacuum within 72 h (see fig. 5), indicating that the specimens were saturated with water. subsequently, the hot disk sensor was horizontally placed between the two saturated specimen pieces with the double spiral centered and totally covered, and the two specimen pieces were ﬁrmly clamped together to ensure that there was no air gap between the sensor and the specimen end surfaces, as presented in fig. 4d. in order to remain water saturation, the saturated specimens and the sensor were kept in a plastic bag during thermal conductivity measurement (adl-zarrabi, 2004). after the test, the used water-saturated specimens were suffered from dehydration treatment in a thermostatic drying oven at 105 °c for a period of 24 h and subsequently cooled in a desiccator to measure the thermal conductivity under a dry condition. meanwhile, the mass of the dry specimens (mdry) was measured, and the porosity (n) of the specimens was calculated using the equations n ¼ 100v p v % v p ¼ msat − mdry ρw ð5þ ð6þ where v is the bulk rock volume, vp is the pore volume, and ρw is the density of water. for each pair of specimens saturated or dried, measurements on the thermal conductivity were carried out at room temperature (25 ± 1 °c). 3.3.2. tests on specimens under increasing temperature to investigate the effect of temperature on the thermal conductivity of the tested rocks, measurements were performed on dry specimens from 40 °c to 150 °c based on the requirements of the used test equipment. compared with measurements at room temperature, the experiments under high temperature are time consuming due to a slow stepwise heating process by using a constant temperature oil bath and a temperature control system, as shown in fig. 4c. the thermal conductivity measurement can only be conducted until the two specimen pieces in the chamber with a specimen holder within the oil bath have reached thermal equilibrium and kept a target temperature value. during thermal equilibrium of the oil bath, the hot disk sensor monitors continuously the temperature variation of the specimens. for our tests, the thermal conductivity of the specimens was measured when the recorded temperature variation of the specimens is less than 0.04 °c. in general, 32 h were needed to complete one test. a typical temperature-time history during the test is presented in fig. 6. it should variation of specimen temperature (oc) 0.35 0.30 0.25

each incremental stress level. after each measurement, the load was maintained constant for a period of about 15 min to avoid residual temperature drifts on the specimens. based on the in-situ stress measurement results obtained from the beishan area (zhao et al., 2013), the maximum axial compression stress applied to the specimens was set to be 45 mpa to approximately simulate the excavation-induced stress near the vertical hlw disposal element boundary at a depth of 600 m. the axial stress applied to the specimens was recorded automatically, and the used stress path throughout the course of testing is presented in fig. 7. the experiments were conducted at room temperature. according to previous experimental results (zhao et al., 2015a; zhao et al., 2015b), the identiﬁed crack initiation stresses of cylindrical specimens of beishan granitic rocks under uniaxial compression using the cumulative ae hit (caeh) method range from 45.3 to 109.1 mpa, which are larger than the maximum compression stress adopted in the present study. hence, the stress-induced rock damage might not occur in the tested specimens during loading. it should be mentioned that in the process of loading, the friction may occur at the interfaces between the specimen ends and the sensor. due to limitation of the tps measurement technique, the utilized test method does not consider the potential inﬂuence of interface friction effect on the experimental results. to reduce or eliminate the friction effect, further efforts are needed to produce innovative design for the test equipment. although not perfect, the developed test system provides a feasible means for us to gain insight into thermal conductivity behaviors of rocks under compression. 4. test results 4.1. inﬂuence of water

content of the specimens, leading to difﬁculties in evaluating the relationship between the thermal conductivity and the water saturation degree of the specimens quantitatively. 3.3.3. tests on specimens under uniaxial compression the uniaxial compression tests on dry specimens were conducted using a hydraulic servo-controlled compression machine. for each test, two specimen pieces with the hot disk sensor were contained between steel platens machined to match their end surfaces, as shown in fig. 4b. the interfaces between the specimens and the steel platens were daubed with a thin layer of lubricant to reduce the end effect of the platens during loading. when the experimental setup was completed, axial-load control was used with a loading rate of 100 n/s and the axial load was increased with an increment thermal conductivity measurements were carried out on the 40 pairs of specimens both in dry and water-saturated conditions, and the results are listed in table 2. a statistical analysis shows that for the eight rock groups under dry or saturated state, the standard deviation (sd) and coefﬁcient of variation (cov) of the thermal conductivity are all less than 0.06 w/mk and 4%, respectively, indicating that the results between specimens in each rock group have a good consistency. for all rock groups, the average thermal conductivity values in the dry state (kdry) range between 2.412 and 2.812 w/mk. the values under watersaturated condition (ksat) for the same set of specimens range from 130 x.g. zhao et al. / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137\\x0cx.g.

from table 2 that the tested rocks have an average porosity range from 0.40% to 1.37%. when the dry specimens were saturated with water, water with a higher thermal conductivity (0.604 w/mk) replaced the air with a lower thermal conductivity (0.025 w/mk) in the void of the rocks, leading to an increase of the thermal conductivity. for our data set, the mean thermal conductivity values of the saturated specimens in different rocks groups range from 6.5% to 24.2% higher than those of dry ones. as presented in fig. 8, for the rock groups (i.e., bs06, bs16, bs18-1, bs18-2, bs19-1 and bs19-2) with an average porosity range between 0.40% and 0.52%, the inﬂuence of water saturation on the thermal conductivity of the rocks is relatively small, and ksat increases with increasing kdry in an

seen that the thermal conductivity of the specimens shows a decaying trend with increasing temperature, and the values at 150 °c range from 5.7% to 8.7% lower than those at room temperature. this means that within the used temperature range, the inﬂuence of the increasing temperature on the decay of thermal conductivity for these rocks is limited. on the other hand, a possible reason for the gradual decrease in thermal conductivity is the generation of thermally induced microcracks in the rocks because of a mismatch between thermal expansion coefﬁcients of adjacent mineral grains in a homogeneous temperature ﬁeld (jansen et al., 1993), which has been demonstrated from a microcracking perspective based on numerical simulations (zhao, 2016). based on the experimental data, the relationship between thermal conductivity and temperature can be described using the equation: k ¼ kr − at2 ð8þ where kr is the thermal conductivity of the rock at room temperature (25 °c), t is the temperature in celsius, and a is the ﬁt coefﬁcient (see table 3). the parameter a affects the decaying velocity of the thermal conductivity with the temperature, i.e., the decaying velocity of the thermal conductivity increases as a increases. as shown in table 3, a in eq. (8) varies from rock to rock and can be determined only using laboratory tests. in order to develop a model for predicting a, individual fit overall fit (model) bs15-07 bs18-1-08 bs06-05 bs18-2-05 bs19-1-05 bs05-07 bs16-05 2.9 2.8 2.7 2.6 2.5 2.4 2.3 2.2 thermal conductivity (w/mk) 0 20 40 80 60 100 temperature (oc) 120 140 160 fig. 13. comparison of overall ﬁt using the temperature and rock porosity dependent thermal conductivity model and individual ﬁt of seven pairs of specimens in different rock groups. behavior. however, with further increase of rock porosity, the approximately linear relationship between kdry and ksat is not valid anymore. for example, the rock groups bs05 and bs15 with average porosity values greater than or equal to 0.68% exhibit higher thermal conductivity in the water-saturated state relative to the dry state. to evaluate the thermal conductivity of rocks, various mixing models such as the geometric mean (lichtenecker, 1924), the arithmetic mean (voigt, 1928), the hashin–shtrikman mean (hashin and shtrikman, 1962), and the effective-medium mean (bruggeman, 1935; clauser, 2009) have been proposed. comprehensive overviews and case studies on such mixing models can be found in (abdulagatova et al., 2009; clauser, 2009; fuchs et al., 2013; hartmann, 2005; ray et al., 2015). based on the experimental data (see table 2) in combination with the methodology used by fuchs et al. (2013), the abovementioned mixing models were used to predict the thermal conductivity values of the tested rocks in the water-saturated state. fig. 9 shows the comparison between measured and calculated thermal conductivities for the four different models. it can be observed from fig. 9a, b, and d that the geometric mean, the arithmetic mean, and the effectivemedium mean yield similar prediction results and consistently underestimate the thermal conductivity of the eight rock groups, especially for the groups with relatively high porosity values (e.g., groups bs05 and bs15). the hashin–shtrikman mean shows a reasonably good ﬁt for all rock groups, as shown in fig. 9c. the analysis results are basically in line with observations reported by fuchs et al. (2013) because most of the evaluated mixing models used in their analysis also underestimate the thermal conductivity of the rocks. however, the geometric mean model was rated as the best ﬁt to their data set. it should be noted that the rocks used in their analysis covered different rock types with a large range in porosity, from almost zero to about 30%. in addition, the measured thermal conductivity values of these rocks spans the interval between 1.0 and 6.5 w/mk. the present investigations focused mainly on the granitic rocks with low porosities and a narrow thermal conductivity range. hence, the large difference of rock properties may result in uncertainties between analysis results obtained from various mixing models. more work is required to explain this discrepancy. nagaraju and roy (2014) deﬁned the effect of water saturation on thermal conductivity (s) as a function of porosity of rocks, and s is expressed by s ¼ ksat − kdry ð7þ kdry according to the measurement results listed in table 2, we established the relationship between s and the porosity of the rocks, as presented in fig. 10. analysis of fig. 10 reveals that the effect of water saturation on thermal conductivity of rocks presents an increasing trend with an increase of porosity. a linear form expression can ﬁt the data reasonably well while ensuring that the line passes through the origin. 4.2. inﬂuence of temperature on the thermal conductivity fig. 11 presents the variation of thermal conductivity of seven pairs of dry specimens in different rock groups with temperature from 40 °c table 3 fit coefﬁcient a for thermal conductivity-temperature curves of seven pairs of specimens in different rock groups. rock type and specimen no. monzogranite (bs05-07) granodiorite (bs06-05) monzogranite (bs15-07) granodiorite (bs16-05) monzogranite (bs18-1-08) granodiorite (bs18-2-05) monzogranite (bs19-1-07) a (10−6) 8.821 5.679 8.394 4.871 6.891 5.728 6.385 r2 0.9830 0.9334 0.9853 0.9289 0.9262 0.9581 0.9933 132 x.g. zhao et al. / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137\\x0cx.g. zhao et al. / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137 133 n=2 20 10 axial stress (mpa) 30 40 n=3 20 10 axial stress (mpa) 30 40 50 50 3.4 3.3 3.2 3.1 3.0 2.9 2.8 2.7 2.6 2.5 2.4 c thermal conductivity (w/mk) 50 0 f 2.9 2.8 2.7 2.6 2.5 2.4 thermal conductivity (w/mk) 50 0 n=3 20 10 axial stress (mpa) 30 40 n=3 20 10 axial stress (mpa) 30 40 bs05 bs06 bs15 bs16 bs18-1 bs18-2 bs19-1 bs19-2 y=24.15-24.99e-x (r2=0.9296) 21 18 15 12 0369 i r(%) n=1 20 10 axial stress (mpa) 30 40 50 0.0 0.3 0.9 1.2 0.6 porosity (%) 1.5 1.8 b 3.0 2.9 2.8 2.7 2.6 2.5 2.4 thermal conductivity (w/mk) 50 0 3.2e 3.1 3.0 2.9 2.8 2.7 2.6 2.5 2.4 thermal conductivity (w/mk) 50 0 3.2h 3.1 3.0 2.9 2.8 2.7 2.6 thermal conductivity (w/mk) 50 0 n=3 20 10 axial stress (mpa) 30 40 n=3 20 10 axial stress (mpa) 30 40 n=2 20 10 axial stress (mpa) 30 40 3.0 2.9 2.8 2.7 2.6 2.5 2.4 2.3 2.2 a thermal conductivity (w/mk) 3.0d 2.9 2.8 2.7 2.6 2.5 2.4 2.3 2.2 2.1 2.0 thermal conductivity (w/mk) 3.0g 2.9 2.8 2.7 2.6 2.5 2.4 thermal conductivity (w/mk) 0 0 0 fig. 14. inﬂuence of axial compression stress on the thermal conductivity of the eight rock groups: (a) bs05, (b) bs06, (c) bs15, (d) bs16, (e) bs18-1, (f) bs18-2, (g) bs19-1 and (h) bs19-2, and variation of the increase rate of the thermal conductivity (r) with rock porosity (i). error bars indicate the standard deviation of the thermal conductivity. n in the ﬁgures represents the number of specimen pairs in each rock group. we attempted to relate a with other rock parameters and found that a depended on the magnitude of rock porosity (n), as presented in fig. 12. the coefﬁcient a varies with porosity n according to the following equation: a ¼ 9:43 − 0:71=n2 ð9þ according to eqs.

(11) is not sensitive to the variation of rock porosity, and is within the range from 0.20 to 0.27 except for the rock group bs19-1. for simplicity, an average value of c = 0.24 obtained from table 4 is used to approximately describe the trend, as shown in fig. 15b. using eqs. (11)–(12) and the constant coefﬁcient c, an overall ﬁt is made for these rock groups to reproduce the rock porosity-dependent thermal conductivity under different axial stresses. a comparison between individual and overall ﬁt results is presented in fig. 16. it is found that for each rock group subjected to different compression stresses, the difference of the thermal conductivity values from the individual and overall ﬁts is less than 0.05 w/mk. the good agreement indicates that the established rock porosity-dependent model can capture the nonlinear stress-thermal conductivity relationships of the beishan granitic rocks satisfactorily. 5. discussion one of the ﬁndings from the experimental investigations in the previous sections is that the rock porosity has an inﬂuence on the thermal conductivity of the beishan granitic rocks under water saturation, increasing temperature and compression stress conditions, although the porosity of tested rocks is relatively low. it is well known that for low-porosity crystalline rocks, the mineral composition plays an important role in dominating the thermal conductivity. the crystalline rocks are mainly made up of quartz, feldspars, and maﬁc minerals such as pyroxene, amphibole and biotite, and the content of minerals from these three mineral groups basically determines a rock's thermal conductivity (clauser and huenges, 1995). as mentioned in section 2, a model analysis on a total of 46 thin sections of the rocks was conducted to identify the dominant minerals in the rocks. as listed in table 1, the main minerals of these rocks include quartz, plagioclase, k-feldspar and biotite. among these four minerals, quartz has the highest thermal conductivity (7.69 w/mk) while another three minerals have a thermal conductivity range between 1.70 and 2.29 w/mk (horai, 1971). hence, when the porosity values of the specimens in different rock groups are close to each other, quartz content in the rocks may determine the thermal conductivity. according to the data listed in table 2, fig. 17a presents the inﬂuence of quartz content on the average thermal conductivity of different rock groups in dry state. it is seen that except for rock groups bs05 and bs15 (which have relatively large porosity values of 1.37% and 0.68%, respectively), thermal conductivity of the rocks appears an increasing trend with increasing quartz content. when the specimens are subjected to compression stresses, the original pores and cracks in the rocks tend to close, and the effective contact areas between mineral grains increase, leading to a signiﬁcant decay of the porosity effect on the thermal conductivity, especially for rocks with relatively high porosity. on the other hand, the closure of pores and cracks increases the contact opportunity of quartz grains, and hence improves the transportation capability of heat ﬂow in the rocks. under this condition, an obvious increase of the thermal conductivity for all rock groups with increasing quartz content can be observed, as presented in fig. 17b. 6. conclusions beishan granitic rocks are candidate host rock types for china's hlw repository. in this paper, thermal conductivity characteristics of the beishan granitic rocks have been investigated using the transient plane source (tps) method. the measurement results indicate that for the used eight rock groups with a porosity range from 0.40% to 1.37%, the average thermal conductivity values in the dry state range between 2.412 and 2.812 w/mk. the values under water-saturated condition range from 2.602 to 3.156 w/mk. meanwhile, the effect of water saturation on thermal conductivity presents an increasing trend with an increase of rock porosity. using several mixing models proposed by previous researchers, we found that the hashin–shtrikman mean model showed a reasonably good ﬁt to the experimental data while another three models currently obtained data, a best ﬁtting equation of axial stressdependent thermal conductivity for these rocks can be expressed as (demırcı et al., 2004) k ¼ k0 þ bσ c ð11þ 1 where k0 is the thermal conductivity of the rock at zero stress, σ1 is the axial stress, and b and c are ﬁt coefﬁcients, as listed in table 4. analysis of eq. (11) reveals that the coefﬁcient b plays a critical role in controlling the increasing gradient of the thermal conductivity in the initial loading stage (i.e., crack closure stage). the coefﬁcient c dominantly affects the increasing velocity of the thermal conductivity in the subsequent elastic deformation stage. based on experimental investigations on the thermal conductivity of some rocks subjected to uniaxial stresses using a steady-state apparatus developed by demırcı et al. (2004), görgülü et al. (2008) found that the parameters b and c depended on the magnitude of elastic modulus of the rocks, and subsequently established an elastic modulus dependent model to predict the thermal conductivity values under pressure. unfortunately, in the present study, the elastic moduli of the tested rocks have not been available. therefore, the model proposed by görgülü et al. (2008) cannot be used to ﬁt our test results. according to fig. 14, we found that the increasing gradients of the thermal conductivities in the initial loading stage were generally large for the rocks with a high porosity such as rock groups bs05 and bs15. hence, the coefﬁcient b is associated with the rock porosity n, i.e., b increases as n increases, as presented in fig. 15a. an exponential form expression can ﬁt the data reasonably, as follows: b ¼ 0:25 − 0:24 exp −nð þ ð12þ bs05 bs06 bs15 bs16 bs18-1 bs18-2 bs19-1 bs19-2 20 22 24 26 28 30 32 34 quartz content (%) bs05 bs06 bs15 bs16 bs18-1

inﬂuence of quartz content on the average thermal conductivities of the eight rock groups in dry state (a) and compression state with an axial stress of 45 mpa (b).\\x0c136 x.g. zhao et al. / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137 (i.e., geometric mean, the arithmetic mean, and the effective-medium mean) yielded similar predictions and underestimated the thermal conductivity of the rocks under the water-saturated condition. future work is demanded to verify the validity of various mixing models using different rock types with a large porosity range. with increasing temperature from 25 °c to 150 °c, the thermal conductivity of the rocks shows a decaying trend and the values at 150 °c range from 5.7% to 8.7% lower than those at room temperature, revealing that the inﬂuence of temperature on the thermal conductivity of the tested rocks is limited. in addition, the thermal conductivity of the rocks increases with increasing compression stress in a nonlinear behavior, and the increase rate of the thermal conductivity increases with an increase of rock porosity. it is found that the effects of compression stress and water saturation on the magnitude of thermal conductivity of the rocks are basically comparable. based on the experimental data, the empirical models considering the inﬂuence of rock porosity have been established for predicting the temperature and compression stress dependent thermal conductivity characteristics of the rocks, and the predictions are found to be in good agreement with experimental results. this study thus emphasizes importance of porosity on thermal conductivity measurements even for low porosity crystalline rocks. when the pores and cracks in the rocks tend to close during compression, quartz content may determine the thermal conductivity, and there exists an increase of the thermal conductivity with increasing quartz content. this is because the closure of pores and cracks increases the contact opportunity of quartz grains, and hence improves the transportation capability of heat ﬂow in the rocks. while the test results provide insights into the thermal conductivity characteristics of beishan granitic rocks, one should be aware of the limitation of this study. because the thermal conductivity of granitic rocks is inﬂuenced by many factors. in order to better understand the thermal conductivity of granitic rocks related to rock characteristics such as rock fabric, grain shape, grain contact and grain size, comprehensive petrographic investigations are recommended in the future. in the meantime, studies should be carried out to understand how the interactions between mineral components affect the thermal conductivity. work is also being conducted to investigate the thermal conductivity of the rocks under coupled thermal-hydro-mechanical conditions. acknowledgments this work has been supported by the china atomic energy authority through the geological disposal program and the national natural

2016 / published online: 19 july 2016 ó springer-verlag berlin heidelberg 2016 abstract subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow of reservoirs in active tectonic regions is mainly controlled by permeability of fault zones. therefore, the characterization of fault zones is an important step toward performance assessment of a reservoir. the ﬂuid ﬂow is controlled also by pressure and temperature conditions. in this context, we simulated pressure and temperature ﬁelds to elaborate on the inﬂuence of permeability on subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow in the lahendong geothermal reservoir. thermal–hydraulic simulation is performed using a ﬁnite element approach. adjusting the permeability through 370 different cases, modeling results converged to the observed data within a misﬁt range of 0–7 %. the best ﬁtting models identiﬁed a deep-seated fault that has previously not been traced at the surface. simulated temperature distribution suggests a prominent convective heat ﬂow, driven by an upward migrating and sw–ne oriented ﬂuid ﬂow. this hydraulic gradient causes a pressure drop along the reservoir. highpressure patterns are used to constrain recharge areas, in addition to inﬁltration measurements. discharge ﬂow occurs from sw to ne migrating also upward toward the hot springs. in that frame, thermal–hydraulic simulations identiﬁed previously unresolved subsurface faults, which & maren brehme

essential component to supply future energy demands. requires developing new geothermal sites and improving the performance of existing systems to satisfy continuously growing demand. the productivity of a geothermal ﬁeld mainly depends on subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow, which in active tectonic regions is controlled by permeability of fault zones (moeck 2014). in that frame, the primary focus is on locating and characterizing faulted areas in geothermal ﬁelds. this study employs numerical modeling to allocate and quantify permeability anisotropies and discontinuities, e.g., faults, in order to understand their inﬂuence on subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow in geothermal reservoirs. numerical models have been increasingly used to understand the setup and productivity of geothermal systems. a general overview of geothermal models has been given by o’sullivan et al. (2001). additionally, there are several sites exemplifying similar characteristics as in lahendong. the underground movement of hot and cold ﬂuids has been modeled for geothermal ﬁelds in new zealand (kaya et al. 2014). the kakkonda geothermal site, e.g., consists of two reservoirs at various depths with different ﬂuid properties. there, results from ﬂuid ﬂow analysis show the importance of fractures for ﬂuid transport enhancing the recharge or discharge in the reservoir 123\\x0c1088 page 2 of 11 environ earth sci (2016) 75:1088 (mcguinness et al. 1995). generally, faults acting as preferential ﬂuid path ways signiﬁcantly change the pressure and temperature ﬁeld in the reservoir (cherubini et al. 2013). models for the seferihisar–balc¸ova ﬁeld focus on the ﬂuid ﬂow inside of faults. results show an enhanced upward heat transport through ﬂuids from bottom of the geothermal system (magri et al. 2011). our test ground is the lahendong geothermal ﬁeld located in sulawesi, indonesia. the ﬁeld is owned and operated by p.t. pertamina geothermal energy and hosts a power plant with a production capacity of 80 mwe. there, geothermal exploration started in the early 1970s including geophysical and geohydrochemical approaches. it is a water-dominated magmatic structurally controlled system. faults generally act as across-fault ﬂuid barriers and alongfault ﬂuid conductors (brehme et al. 2014). as a result, hot springs mainly appear on the top of vertically permeable faults at the surface. available numerous drilling and surface measurements allowed a detailed characterization of the geological and hydrogeological setting of the area (fig. 1; brehme et al. 2011, 2013, 2014, 2016; wiegand et al. 2013). the model presented here is developed for investigating subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow and the permeability distribution including the fault zones in the lahendong geothermal ﬁeld. below, the geological structure of the ﬁeld is presented followed by an introduction to the modeling approach. detailed investigation of subsurface permeability distribution is a crucial step for site selection and smart drilling strategies. the numerical simulations presented will provide insight into understanding the subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow considering the hydraulic conductivity of faults. it ensures productive as well as sustainable operation of geothermal ﬁelds avoiding risks, such as drilling into non-fractured or cold zones, and targeting highly corroding waters. although the target area is lahendong, the general workﬂow is applicable for other geothermal sites consisting of similar constraints. reservoir characterization hydrogeology the overall driving force for the ﬂuid ﬂow is the sw–ne oriented natural hydraulic gradient in the lahendong geothermal system. the direction of ﬂuid ﬂow varies through the geothermal site due to horizontal partitioning of the reservoir by relatively less permeable fault zones (brehme et al. 2014). the basic sections are located in the fig. 1 topographic map of the study area with geological features, water and rock sample locations, and model cross section 123\\x0cenviron earth sci (2016) 75:1088 page 3 of 11 1088 south, in the east, and beneath lake linau. beneath lake linau, the direction of ﬂuid ﬂow is slightly rotated to wsw–ene (fig. 1). also, types of ﬂuid change from one section to another, e.g., an acidic highly saline-type beneath lake linau and a neutral low saline-type south and east of lake linau (fig. 1). the impermeable structure across faults prevent the ﬂuids from diluting each other (brehme et al. 2016). however, faults are rather permeable along the vertical axis, which allows recharge of the system through the faults. rainwater inﬁltrates at a fault in the sw, at mt. lengkoan, and creek water inﬁltrates into the normal faults at lake linau (fig. 2). the hydrothermal system discharges into lake linau and toward the ne, as driven by the hydraulic gradient (brehme et al. 2014). the fracture network along the area is characterized by strike slip faults and normal faults. the sinistral faults strike n 40° and steeply dip toward the se. left step over on the strike slip faults forms an extension basin in the central study area. normal faults at the extension basin strike nw and dip 70°–80° beneath lake linau (brehme et al. 2014). lithology lahendong area is mainly characterized by pre-, postand tondano formation of plioto pleistocene age (koestono et al. 2010). the rocks are typically andesite, volcanic breccia, and tuff. those types have been sampled from borehole cores and used to determine porosity, permeability, and thermal conductivity. effective porosity and matrix permeability have been analyzed using a cylindrical-shaped specimen with a dimension of 5 cm x 5 cm 9 2.5 cm oriented parallel to the coring (brehme et al. 2016). thermal conductivity has been measured on plain sections of dried cores. the experimental setup consists of a gas permeameter for determining matrix permeability (milsch et al. 2011), of an helium pycnometry for effective porosity measurements (johnson-maynard et al. 1994) and of an optical scanner for thermal conductivity measurements (popov et al. 1999). these parameters have been measured and averaged for the three rock types (brehme et al. 2016; table 1). andesite has an effective porosity of 3.7 %, a permeability of 2.1 9 10-14 m2, and a thermal conductivity of 1.8 w m-1 k-1 (dry) or 2.2 w m-1 k-1 (saturated). tuff has a porosity of 7.7 % but the lowest permeability of 2.0 9 10-15 m2 of 1.6 w m-1 k-1 (saturated). volcanic breccia is a permeable layer with an effective porosity of 10.5 %, a permeability of 2.3 9 10-14 m2, and a thermal conductivity of 1.6 w m-1 k-1 (dry) or 2.5 w m-1 k-1 (saturated). reservoir rocks reﬂect generally low matrix permeability suggesting fracture-controlled ﬂuid ﬂow throughout the aquifer (brehme et al. 2016). and (dry) or 2.1 w m-1 k-1 a thermal conductivity model setup model geometry numerical models developed for the study area represent the initial conditions of the reservoir before production or the commercial ﬁnite injection start. for simulation, fig. 2 cross section of the modeled area with geological structure, boundary conditions, and location of observation points 123\\x0c1088 page 4 of 11 environ earth sci (2016) 75:1088 table 1 thermal and hydraulic parameters of the lahendong reservoir rocks measured in laboratory (brehme et al. 2016) sample (name, depth) rock type effective porosity (%) thermal conductivity dry (w m-1 k-1) thermal conductivity saturated (w m-1 k-1) matrix permeability (m2) lhd1 500–501 lhd1 801–802 lhd1 1000–1001 lhd1 2100–2101 lhd2 300–302 lhd3 2201–2203 lhd4 652–653 lhd4 850–852 lhd4 1001–1002 lhd4 2304–2305 lhd5 602–603 lhd5 752–753 lhd5 1102–1103 lhd5 1404–1406 lhd5 1575–1576 lhd7 901–902,3 lhd7 1567.8–1568 lhd7 1756–1758 average values a b t t a b b a b a b a a a a a t b andesite (a) breccia (b) tuff (t) 1.1 14.5 5.0 7.2 12.5 5.7 6.3 1.6 16.4 1.6 16.3 2.7 5.2 3.6 0.6 4.6 11.0 3.9 3.7 10.5 7.7 (lhd1 550) 2.0 (lhd1 550) 2.2 1.6 1.8 1.4 2.1 1.8 1.4 1.8 1.4 1.9 1.5 1.6 2.1 1.8 1.6 1.6 2.4 2.2 2.0 2.4 2.0 2.7 2.7 2.3 2.3 1.7 2.2 2.7 2.2 2.5 2.1 1.5 9 10-14 8.9 9 10-16 3.3 9 10-15 6.1 9 10-14 1.5 9 10-14 1.3 9 10-14 2.3 9 10-14 6.8 9 10-14 3.4 9 10-16 1.1 9 10-14 1.1 9 10-16 7.9 9 10-14 3.0 9 10-15 7.9 9 10-18 7.2 9 10-16 1.7 9 10-15 1.7 9 10-14 2.1 9 10-14 2.3 9 10-14 2.0 9 10-15 element software feflow is used to model pressuredriven and thermally induced ﬂuid ﬂow including viscosity changes. governing equations for ﬂuid ﬂow and heat transport in saturated porous media are derived from conservation principles of linear momentum, mass, and energy (dhi-wasy 2009). details on the software and the parameterization can be found in diersch (2014). the model geometry is a 2d vertical sw–ne trending cross section extending 6 km in horizontal and 3 km in vertical direction. the direction of the proﬁle has been selected to cover all relevant processes in the lahendong geothermal ﬁeld: it cuts major faults and the production and injection wells, which are used for temperature and pressure calibration. furthermore, to the groundwater ﬂow direction, showing major ﬂuid ﬂow activities. the homogeneous and isotropic geological layers in the model are stratiﬁed nearly horizontally. faults in the middle of the model, striking perpendicular to the cross section, dip with 84° toward a cooling pluton beneath lake linau. details on structural and geological components of the modeled region have been presented in brehme et al. (2014). is parallel it the numerical the mesh used for simulation in feflow consists of 45,264 nodes and 89,320 elements that are denser surrounding the faults because of expected gradients due to parameter contrasts. material properties of 123 elements are permeability, porosity, and thermal conductivity and set according to laboratory measurements (table 1). however, properties of the faults and lake linau are slightly adapted to speciﬁc conditions. the definitions for the modeled grids along the faults are as follows: porosity is 30 % and thermal conductivity is 1.8 w m-1 k-1. corresponding grids for lake linau are deﬁned by a porosity of 100 % and a thermal conductivity of 0.6 w m-1 k-1. the model simulates ﬂuid ﬂow and thermal transport in saturated media in steady state. initial values and boundary conditions fluid ﬂow boundary conditions in the model describe groundwater heads and recharge amounts (table 2; fig. 2). the hydraulic head at the sw model boundary is 837 m and 500 m at the ne boundary. the sw hydraulic head represents inﬁltration of surface water into a fault, striking perpendicular to the model. hydraulic head at the ne border is adapted to borehole measurements in that area (brehme et al. 2014). inﬁltration into the fault zones at lake linau is described by ﬂuid ﬂux boundary conditions. the quantity is 3.0 9 10-4 m s-1 the sw and 1.3 9 10-6 m s-1 at the ne fault distributed over 40 m fault width. groundwater recharge is set to 412 mm a-1 at the ne top surface (table 2; fig. 2). fluid movement in for\\x0cthe model domain is constrained by no-ﬂow boundary at the bottom, recharge through the surrounding fault zones, and the low hydraulic heads in the ne model area. discharge of the system in the central study area is mainly toward lake linau and across the ne model boundary. initial hydraulic head for the whole model domain is 500 m. the heat is 116 °c km-1 at transport boundary conditions are time-invariant, ﬁxed temperatures, and heat ﬂux (table 2; fig. 2). thermal gradient the sw model boundary, and the temperature is constant 350 °c at the pluton. temperature of water inﬁltrating into faults and here mixing with shallow warm groundwater is 70 °c, while surface groundwater recharge is at 28 °c. temperature values are obtained from ﬁeld and bore log measurements (brehme et al. 2014). heat ﬂux is set to 100 mw m-2 at the bottom model boundary (table 2; fig. 2). this value is ﬁxed based on the studies from delisle et al. (1998), nagao and uyeda (1995), and neben et al. (1998). initial temperature for the model domain is set as 116 °c km-1, according to the local thermal gradient. permeability determination initial values for permeability are deﬁned based on laboratory measurements (table 1). after each simulation run, modeled and measured temperature and pressure values have been compared at indicated observation points. in case of poor matching (errors [10 %), permeability has been adjusted until satisfactory results have been achieved. beneath lake linau, simulation results showed locally strong discrepancies between modeled and measured pressure and temperature (errors [45 %). adjustment of permeability in geological inﬁltration rates into faults, or hydraulic heads did not lead to acceptable results. only the implementation of strong permeability anisotropy throughout whole depth, i.e., an additional fault, resulted in minimization of errors (0–7 %). implementation has been accomplished by mesh adaptation to ensure appropriate behavior around the fault. by this procedure, permeability anisotropies have been located and characterized in detail throughout the model. layers, in general, deﬁning a direction-dependent permeability improves the data ﬁt rather than using similar permeabilities in all directions. this is probably due to the fractures increasing the permeability mostly in vertical direction. porosity and thermal conductivity remained constant throughout simulation. variation in porosity is negligible because it would directly be reﬂected in permeability, while thermal conductivity differences would only affect conductive heat transport, which is not dominant in the lahendong area (ondrak et al. 1998; brehme et al. 2014). 123 100c measurementa 500borelog ofmodel bottom boundary nemodel

best ﬁt to the measured data changing the absolute and relative permeability in geological elements. relative permeability refers to different permeabilities in horizontal and vertical direction. as a main result, a blind fault has been recognized beneath lake linau, which has not been known from former studies. simulated pressure and temperature are measured at ﬁve selected observation points, which represent boreholes with available bore logs for pressure and temperature. details on data are given in fig. 6. the model with best data ﬁt, out of 370 different models, is considered to generate the ﬁnal model developed for lahendong. permeability distribution and identiﬁcation of a blind fault distribution of permeability patterns in the reservoir has been conceived comparing temperature and pressure data in several wells. especially beneath lake linau, closely located wells show high variations in temperature and pressure. a drop of 100 °c and 18 bar along 300 m distance has been observed between well lhd 24 and lhd 28. models ﬁrst showed high discrepancies between modeled and measured values in this area. however, after implementing another high anisotropic permeable structure between the observation points, models resulted in satisfactory results. the structure has ten times higher vertical environ earth sci (2016) 75:1088 permeability than horizontal permeability. this structure is assumed to be another fault zone located between two known faults with vertical dip and nw strike. this fault shows no trace at surface, because it is covered by lake linau. generally, modeled permeability distribution in the lahendong reservoir is direction-dependent and overprints the lithology. modeled permeability is generally higher than measured ones in the order of up to four magnitudes. this is due to fracture patterns, which are not detectable at core-sample scale. permeability patterns directly affect subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow and temperature and pressure distribution. permeability in the faulted zones and surroundings is lowest in the study area. especially the middle and ne fault, the shallow area beneath sw lake linau and the deep ne section of the ne fault show low permeabilities between 10-13 and 10-14 m2 (fig. 3). the area between the middle and ne fault, the deep section ne of the sw fault, the sw fault itself and the whole model area toward the sw and ne boundary show higher permeabilities of 10-10 and 10-12 m2 (fig. 3). permeability varies not only within the modeled area, but also in vertical and horizontal direction. in faults and the deep reservoir section in the ne, permeability is by a factor of 10 higher in the vertical direction than in the horizontal direction (fig. 3). in the areas between faults, permeability is in some parts by a factor of 10–100 lower in the vertical direction. in the rest of the model, vertical and horizontal permeability do not differ (fig. 3). fig. 3 final adapted permeability and anisotropy

elevations in the sw. some wells existing in this region are of artesian-type. overpressure releases through high permeable zones beneath lake linau and discharges toward surface. the pressure drop is up to 20 bars across the faults (fig. 4). temperature distribution temperature distribution along the lahendong geothermal reservoir suggests that convective heat transport is the dominating process in the reservoir rocks. isotherms generally follow the sw–ne oriented ﬂow pattern, the rise and the inﬁltration of ﬂuids. upwelling of isotherms between the faults veriﬁes water rise toward lake linau. inﬁltration of cold water causes down welling of isotherms particularly on the northeast section of the model. temperature is locally increased at the bottom of the model surrounding the pluton (fig. 4). subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow the absolute and horizontal/vertical permeability distribution controls local ﬂuid ﬂow in the lahendong reservoir. the general ﬂuid ﬂow, driven by the natural pressure gradient, is oriented from sw to ne. vertical inﬁltration occurs at faults at lake linau and at the sw boundary. discharge is across the ne model boundary (fig. 5). the more detailed ﬂow patterns can be observed with streamlines, which show a ﬂuid ﬂow along highly permeable areas. calculated streamlines describe particle ﬂow within the model domain. a forward calculation shows how inﬁltrating water at the sw model boundary distributes through the reservoir. the backward calculation shows the source of ﬂuid particles arriving at the ne model boundary (fig. 5). patterns show that hot groundwater ﬂows toward the faults beneath lake linau, where the ﬂuid ﬂow is disturbed by a rise in temperature and vertically high permeable layers. this causes a rise of groundwater in this model area (red forward streamlines in fig. 5). at the same time, cold water inﬁltrates into high permeable areas and distributes over the ne model domain (blue backward streamlines in fig. 5). it is clearly seen that the composition of the ne reservoir domain is dominated by coldwater inﬁltration into faults, while the production areas are characterized by hot water ﬂow (fig. 5). discussion investigation of subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow in geothermal reservoirs is crucial for sustainable exploitation avoiding drilling into less productive areas. subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow might be locally inﬂuenced by fault zones or physical 123\\x0c1088 page 8 of 11 environ earth sci (2016) 75:1088 fig. 5 model domain with calculated streamlines, in red: forward streamlines follow hydraulic gradient from sw model boundary towards ne, in blue: backward streamlines representing inﬁltrating cold water ﬂowing towards ne model boundary properties of water (i.e. viscosity). the inﬂuence of these parameters on the ﬂuid ﬂow has been investigated in lahendong geothermal reservoir using hydraulic–thermal simulations. simulation results show the detailed permeability distribution in the reservoir including location of an additional fault zone. matching of measured and simulated temperature and pressure has been used as a tool for resolving the permeability distribution. temperature and pressure have been iteratively determined at several observation points (fig. 2). generally, modeled values are in good agreement with observed ones (fig. 6). nevertheless, some observation points give slightly different values for both pressure and temperature (lhd 4 and lhd 7) or only temperature (lhd 24). this is probably due to the complicated ﬂow processes or strong small-scale structural variation in fractured and faulted areas. furthermore, density variations, which could have not been included into simulation due to high temperatures, could cause variation of ﬂuid pressure. however, the average deviation of simulated pressure and temperature is 1 %. implemented model parameters are porosity, permeability, and heat conductivity. from those parameters, only permeability has been tested in a speciﬁc range during simulation. the inﬂuence of porosity and heat conductivity on ﬂuid ﬂow is negligible due to dominating convective heat ﬂow (ondrak et al. 1998). values implemented in the model are based on measured permeabilities, which represent matrix permeability of rocks. the measured matrix permeability, representing permeability in horizontal direction, is 1.5 9 10-14 m2 on 123 average, which remains within typical permeability range for fractured igneous rocks (schoen 2004). permeability for volcanic breccias ranges typically between 3 9 10-15 and 5 9 10-12 m2 and tuff permeabilities range between 7 9 10-17 and 7 9 10-12 m2 (klavetter and peters 1987). in the wairakei geothermal ﬁeld, simulating the impermeable layers resulted in permeabilities of 10-18 and 10-14 m2, in horizontal and vertical axis, respectively (mercer and faust 1979). however, permeability in reservoir rocks might be locally increased due to fracture formation. it might also be decreased due to alteration and sealing in faults. in lahendong, modeled permeability can be up to four magnitudes higher than measured ones in faulted areas. this is caused by fractures, which are not detectable in core scale. moreover, in fault cores, it is by a factor of 10 higher in vertical direction than in horizontal direction. however, in areas between faults (fault gauge), permeability is in some parts by a factor of 10–100 lower in the vertical direction. adaptation of permeability ensures a ﬁt to measured temperature and pressure data. permeability in fractured areas is the main factor inﬂuencing subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow and temperature distribution in the lahendong reservoir area. subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow is driven by local hydraulic heads, which show high variations at different sections of the study area. consequently, convective heat distribution leads to high temperature variation along the reservoir. these phenomena are observed in lahendong as well as comparable ﬁelds. in new mexico, water level drops of 30–100 m are observed across (haneberg 1995). high several fault zones\\x0c123 environ earth sci (2016) 75:1088 page 9 of 11 1088 7 24 4 28 5 well name lhd 4 lhd 5 lhd 7

from brehme et al. (2014) temperature drops and upwelling of isotherms indicate that fault zones control the ﬂuid ﬂow in the lake long and valentine ﬁelds, usa (hooper 1991). the analysis of ﬂuid pressure differences at the alpine fault, new zealand, allowed to characterize the change in permeability between hanging and footwall blocks (sutherland et al. 2012). in summary, high pressure or temperature gradients are indicators for ﬂuid barriers between observation points. in other words, reservoir sections of different properties are separated by horizontally less permeable faults. in lahendong, most signiﬁcant ﬂuid barriers are faults to the sw and to the ne of lake linau. across these barriers, the pressure drops up to 20 bars. a similar pattern has been measured in bore logs beneath lake linau, where no surface trace of a fault had been observed in former studies. however, only by implementing another fault, modeled and measured values could have been adapted. the recently identiﬁed fault zone beneath lake linau remains under lake water and therefore is only traceable by this kind of reservoir modeling. additionally to fault identiﬁcation, the internal structure of known fault zones has been understood in detail. the ne fault, i.e., shows a displacement at 2 km depth. the detailed trend has been understood by permeability adaptation in this area. due to low permeability in horizontal direction in the faults, ﬂuids propagate mostly vertically toward the hot springs at surface. it also allows surface water to inﬁltrate into the reservoir in case the pressure within the fault zone is low enough (fig. 5). this vertical ﬂuid movement eventually controls the temperature distribution in the reservoir. upward migration of deep hot water increases the temperature, while inﬁltration of cold surface water causes local drop of temperature. in summary, the most important factors inﬂuencing the reliability of numerical reservoir models are absolute and different horizontal and vertical permeability. however, a permeability adaptation has been done for each geological layer; the vertical permeability anomalies are overprinting those layers and are constraining the regional groundwater ﬂow. those permeabilities of fractures directly inﬂuence the productivity of the reservoir (cherubini et al. 2013). therefore, their permeability characteristics should be investigated in detail. in a previous study, a numerical model for the lahendong site has been set up in tough2 and aimed at forecasting the reservoir behavior during exploitation until the year 2036. with a production of 60 mwe, it predicts a pressure drop of 10 bars. however, the forecast results are uncertain due to lack of measured pressure draw down data (yani 2006). accordingly, the next steps of the presented study should include a realistic production and injection scenario in order reservoir exploitation. furthermore, chemical characteristics could be considered to achieve reliable production setups, because hydrochemical processes play an important role in the lahendong reservoir (brehme et al. 2016). presented models from this study provide important information on ﬂuid ﬂow in the water-dominated lahendong reservoir. however, additional the two-phase ﬂow models of to support sustainable\\x0c1088 page 10 of 11 environ earth sci (2016) 75:1088 lahendong area are in progress to understand the inﬂuence of steam driven ﬂuid ﬂow in this high-temperature system. conclusion the primary focus of this study is to understand the inﬂuence of fault zones and permeability patterns on subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow in geothermal reservoirs. the ﬂuid ﬂow mainly depends on rock and fault zone permeability. these processes have been considered in numerical models, which simulate local temperature and pressure conditions. the initial reservoir conditions, which refers to the case before production starts. models are developed based on the conceptual models of the study area, which explain reservoir geometry, geological structures, temperature, and hydraulic conditions. temperature and pressure well-logs have been used for model calibration. the numerical models represent vertical and horizontal ﬂuid ﬂow is mainly controlled by fault permeability. this characteristic is used to simulate different reservoir sections, and vertical ﬂuid rise toward the surface. by stepwise adaptation of permeability ﬁelds, based on observed temperature and pressure gradients, an additional blind fault zone can be identiﬁed beneath lake linau. temperature and pressure signiﬁcantly drop across that ﬂuid barrier. this behavior has been observed in comparable ﬁelds in the usa as well. the overall shape of ﬂuid ﬂow direction trends in a sw–ne direction. main recharge occurs by inﬁltration of surface water into the faults, especially in the southwest and near to lake linau. discharge is enhanced in highly fractured areas toward lake linau. vertical permeability of faults allows ﬂuids rising toward the hot springs at surface. results show that permeability has to be considered for simulation of a geothermal system. the geothermal system is mainly controlled by ﬂuid ﬂow in fractures/faults depending on temperature and pressure conditions. the locally modiﬁed ﬂuid ﬂow can considerably inﬂuence the productivity of a geothermal ﬁeld. results also guide reservoir management in case of a potential for ﬁeld extension, as performed in lahendong. acknowledgments the authors acknowledge the continuous support within the team of the international center

keywords: geothermal energy granite high temperature stress-strain response triaxial acoustic xrd geothermal heat has now been identiﬁed as an effective renewable energy source due to severe environmental impacts created by conventional fossil usage on global climatic change. however, its wide application has been limited due to the lack of knowledge, particularly of the geothermal conditions of reservoir rocks at elevated temperatures and pressures. such high temperatures and pressures possibly alter the mechanical properties of reservoir rocks due to the associated micro-structural and mineralogical alterations of the rock mass, which are an important attribute for wellbore stability and stimulation of geothermal reservoirs for safe and effective geothermal energy extraction. this study therefore investigates the stress-strain behaviour under in-situ stress and temperature conditions by conducting a series of high-pressure, high-temperature tri-axial experiments on australian strathbogie granite under four different conﬁning pressures (10, 30, 60, 90 mpa) and four different temperatures (rt, 100, 200, 300 ◦c). the effect of temperature on the mechanical behaviour of rock specimens was studied under tri-axial conditions and the corresponding fracture propagation behaviour was observed using an advanced acoustic emission (ae) system. the corresponding micro-structure alteration in granite was observed using sem analysis. according to the ﬁndings, increasing temperature leads to an initial increment in reservoir rock strength and shear parameters followed by reduction, and the trend is aligned with the crack formation pattern of the rock mass. this was further conﬁrmed by the sem analysis, according to which the rock micro-structure is subject to only minor changes at relatively low temperatures and higher temperatures cause micro-cracks to develop along the rock mass grain boundaries. furthermore, the conventional mohr-coulomb criteria failed to model the stress-strain response of rock under geothermal reservoir conditions, and was therefore modiﬁed for the corresponding in-situ conditions. © 2016 elsevier ltd. all rights

adequate temperatures to serve as a geothermal reservoirs (fox et al., 2013). such explorations involve ﬁnding vast blocks of “hot rocks” with fracture systems. such rocks can be used to generate electricity. in this process, water is ﬁrst injected and circulated through the fractures in the geothermal reservoirs and eventually pumped back to the surface as steam. however, the exploration of geothermal resources has become a challenge to engineers and geologists, due to the high temperature and stress environments in geothermal reservoirs. for this reason, laboratory experiments conducted under high pressure and temperature conditions (geothermal conditions) can assist in providing\\x0cw.g.p. kumari et al. / geothermics 65 (2017) 44–59 45 basic predictions. a large number of laboratory experiments has therefore been conducted since 1970 to investigate the inﬂuence of high pressure and temperature on rock in relation to geothermal heat extraction (siratovich et al., 2016), deep geological disposal of nuclear waste (paquet and franc¸ ois, 1980), deep mining (wawersik and hannum, 1980) and geological co2 storage (dai et al., 2014). the mechanical behaviour of reservoir rocks is signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by elevated temperatures, because they cause the micro-structure of the rock mass to be altered through thermal expansion, the development of new micro-cracks, extending and/or widening the existing micro cracks and various mineralogical alterations. rock strength-deformation criteria change with temperature, and some rock mechanical properties, such as compressive strength, tensile strength, elastic modulus, cohesive strength and friction angle, decrease with increasing temperature (heuze, 1983; dwivedi et al., 2008). however, such alterations are also affected by the conﬁnement applying on the rock mass, and conﬁning pressure causes the suppression of thermal cracks and the extension/widening of existing micro-cracks. this results in further alteration of the rock mass mechanical properties, resulting in changing failure modes (mogi, 1966). studies have identiﬁed the transition of rock failure mode from brittle to ductile with increasing conﬁnement. however, this transition is diverse due to the different mineralogical compositions and grain boundaries in different rocks (klein et al., 2001; wong, 1982). although many studies have been conducted to investigate the temperature-dependent mechanical behaviour of reservoir rocks, most experiments have been conducted in unconﬁned environments (singh et al., 2015; shao et al., 2014). pre-heating the specimens to the corresponding temperature ranges and testing at room temperatures has been frequently done (bauer and johnson, 1979; xu et al., 2008), but the method is not reliable, as geothermal reservoirs experience continuous thermal stresses. such limitations have occurred mainly due to the limited number of appropriate test facilities available to simulate the stress and temperature conditions of actual geothermal reservoirs. although some studies have analytically and numerically evaluated the mechanical properties of rocks under high temperatures and pressures (chester and higgs, 1992; tian et al., 2013; vásárhelyi et al., 2016), to date none has captured the stress-strain behaviour and failure criteria of rocks over a wide range of conﬁning pressures and temperatures, particularly for australian granite. however, the thermo-elastic response and appropriate failure criteria are essential inputs for many engineering applications under high pressures and temperatures, including geothermal extraction applications. this study therefore intends to ﬁll this gap, and it is hoped it will make an important contribution to many deep underground applications. 2. methodology 2.1. tested material granite is an abundant crystalline rock in the earth with medium to coarse grains which was formed as a result of the slow cooling of magma. granite therefore has abundant radioactive elements (k, th, and u). such elements bring elevated geothermal gradients to deep granite reservoirs, which therefore have ideal conditions as geothermal reservoirs. the mineralogical composition of granite mainly consists of quartz, feldspar, plagioclase and biotite, and small amounts of muscovite, amphibole, hornblende and opaque (dwivedi et al., 2008). for the present study, samples were collected from the strathbogie batholith, which is a composite granitoid intrusion body spreading over more than 1500 km2 in 150 km north-east from melbourne (fig. 1). strathbogie granite is a high-level, discordant fig. 1. sampling location of strathbogie batholith in central victoria. table 1 physical, mechanical and petrographic properties of strathbogie granite

(a) dilatancy and failure by strain softening under relatively low conﬁning pressures and (b) failure by strain hardening under elevated conﬁning pressures, and a transitional regime may be observed at intermediate pressures. these transitional failure modes have been referred to as “quasi-brittle”, and complex localized features such as conjugate shear bands can be observed under such conditions (klein et al., 2001; gajo et al., 2004). by visual inspection of the post-failure samples, important information about the alteration of the granite failure mechanism with conﬁning pressures and temperatures can be identiﬁed. postfailure images (fig. 5) were therefore collected after each test. according to the post-failure images, specimens that failed at 10–60 mpa conﬁning pressures mainly failed by shear localization along an inclined macroscopic shear band with a single shear zone across each sample. however, samples tested at higher conﬁnements of 90 mpa and 120 mpa (at 100 ◦c) exhibited strain hardening characteristics after achieving the peak stress, and several conjugate shear bands could be observed on the cylindrical sample surface, instead of the single shear band observed earlier. this characteristic was signiﬁcant at 120 mpa conﬁning pressure. however, it should be noted that only one test was conducted at 120 mpa conﬁnement, because at such high conﬁning pressures the corresponding failure load of granite exceeds the bottom pedestal’s load-bearing capacity. further, a progressive reduction was observed in the failure plane angle with respect to the minor principal stress direction with increasing conﬁning pressure, which implies a reduction in friction angle, possibly due to the greater quasi-brittle behaviour that was shown by granite samples at higher conﬁning pressures (wong et al., 2001). 3.2. effect of temperature and conﬁning pressure on mechanical properties of strathbogie granite fig. 6 illustrates the inﬂuence of temperature on the deviatoric stress of the tested granite under each conﬁnement. as the ﬁgure shows, the inﬂuence of conﬁnement is more signiﬁcant than that of temperature in the temperature range considered here. wong and brace (1979) conﬁrm that at lower conﬁning pressures considerable thermal cracking occurs at relatively low temperatures. if thermal cracking is responsible for the reduction in failure strength, a sharp reduction in deviatoric stress with increasing temperature (with suppression of thermal cracks) should be exhibited under unconﬁned pressure condition. however, based on the experimental results, under unconﬁned conditions, up to 100 ◦c, 17.6% of increment in deviatoric stress is followed by 2.5% and 10.5% reductions at 200 ◦c and 300 ◦c, respectively. however, when conﬁnement was applied, strength reduction was initiated after higher temperature of 200 ◦c, mainly due to the inhibition of a thermal cracks by induced compressive force. thermal cracking is therefore an important strength property alteration mechanism in reservoir rocks under certain conﬁning pressure conditions. a clear inﬂuence of temperature on deviatoric stress at any depth or conﬁnement can be observed, and increasing the temperature from room temperature to 200 ◦c causes an increment in deviatoric stress, and further increasing of temperature to 300 ◦c causes a slight reduction in it. this is because the thermal expansion which occurs with increasing temperature causes the reduction of fig. 3.

which is only 0.19% of maximum measurement. during the load application, the axial strain was measured using linear variable differential transducers (lvdts) attached to the ram of the load cell (fig. 3(a)). an acoustic emission (ae) system was also employed in the testing of samples to record the data related to the fracturing process. the ae system adopted was a peripheral component interconnection (pci) system with a nominal resolution frequency of 500 khz. during the experiments, two sensors were attached to either side of the loading shaft and with the external ampliﬁers, which generated low frequency acoustic waves with the fracturing of the sample. in addition, possible micro-structural and mineralogical changes that occurred during thermal and conﬁnement effects were checked using sem analyses. 3. results and discussion 3.1. the overall stress-strain response the inﬂuence of temperature on the stress-strain behaviour of the tested granite was considered ﬁrst

conﬁning pressure. the reductions of strength characteristics were relatively small up to 500 ◦c and beyond that an accelerated downward trend was identiﬁed. furthermore, wider localized zones were observed at high temperatures in the post-failure images. however, these studies were conducted at wider temperature ranges (up to 700 ◦c and 900 ◦c, respectively) and the researchers therefore did not pay close attention to reservoir rock behaviour under relatively low geothermal temperature ranges (<300 ◦c). this was the focus of the present study, according to which there is an initial strengthening and stiffening in granite with increasing temperature at low temperatures (up to 200 ◦c), and increasing the temperature beyond a certain value causes a gradual reduction in failure stress with increasing temperature. elastic modulus is an important mechanical property of any reservoir rock, and describes the brittle characteristics of the rock mass. it is therefore often used to evaluate many in-situ stress applications, including wellbore stability, fracturing possibility and tectonic stress distribution (heard and page, 1982). the temperature-dependent brittle properties (elastic modulus) of the tested granite were then evaluated. the elastic region of each stress-strain curve was used to calculate the temperature and pressure-dependent young’s moduli (e) and the results are shown in fig. 7. the axial strain was measured using lvdts attached to the loading ram with a linearity ±0.1% f.s (full scale) (±0.0075 mm) and inﬁnite resoluerror of tion (no hysteresis). an increment of the modulus of strathbogie granite with increasing temperature up to 200 ◦c can be observed, and further increase of temperature (to 300 ◦c) causes the elastic modulus to be slightly reduced for any conﬁnement. this trend is\\x0ca ‘brittle’ or general increment in elastic modulus with increasing conﬁnement can be observed until 90 mpa, and a further increase of conﬁnement (to 120 mpa) reduces the young’s modulus considerably. with increasing conﬁning stress additional plastic deformation occurs, exhibiting strain-hardening characteristics in granite under high conﬁnements. however, within the range of the experiments conducted (10 mpa–120 mpa) it cannot be deﬁnitively identiﬁed as a ’ductile’ regime. however, the strain-hardening behaviour observed at 120 mpa indicates transitional characteristics and this can be identiﬁed as ‘quasi-brittle’ behaviour (klein et al., 2001). the initial young’s modulus reduction with increasing conﬁnement was observed by heard and page (1982), who conducted tests up to 55 mpa conﬁning pressure. however, the latter behaviour was not observed by these researchers. interestingly, according to the research literature, at low temperatures (<200 ◦c) some granite types are more temperature-sensitive, while in contrast, some granites are more temperature-sensitive at high temperatures. the initial strength enhancement is more signiﬁcant for coarse-grained granites and granodiorite than for ﬁne-grained granites. for example, according to heard and page (1982), stripa granite is more sensitive to temperature at relatively low temperatures (<200 ◦c), and westerly granite is more sensitive to temperature at high temperatures (>200 ◦c). such contradictory behaviours may occur in granite due to the different grain size distributions, grain orientations, mineralogical compositions and heterogeneity of different granite types. this indicates the importance of studying the mineralogical composition and microstructural inﬂuence of granites on such on temperature-dependent strength variations. 3.3. effect of temperature on shear strength parameters of strathbogie granite fig. 8 illustrates the variation of deviatoric stress of the tested granite with conﬁning pressure for each temperature. the ﬁgure shows that increasing conﬁnement causes the granite’s deviatoric stress to increase non-linearly and gradually come to a steady state. this is consistent with similar previous studies, which have clearly shown the enhancement of rock strength with increasing conﬁnement, and the increasing rate is reduced with increasing conﬁning pressure (barton, 2013; singh et al., 2011). this is because at low conﬁning pressures there is a high dilation potential. therefore, the ability to open rock micro-cracks is high, resulting in higher friction angles. however, this dilation potential and the corresponding tendency for micro-cracks to open are suppressed with increasing conﬁnement, resulting in lower friction angles at higher conﬁning pressures. therefore, the failure mechanism of the rocks shifts from brittle to ductile with increasing conﬁnement, changing the shape of the mohr-coulomb failure envelope, and according to barton (1976), at critical conﬁning pressure the mohr-coulomb failure envelope reaches a zero gradient. this has also been shown by hoek (1983). the present study has clearly identiﬁed this rock behaviour in the mohr-coulomb failure envelopes developed for each temperature condition (refer to fig. 9). according to fig. 9, the traditional linear mohr-coulomb criteria are applicable only in the brittle region of the failure envelope, and at higher conﬁnew.g.p. kumari et al. / geothermics 65 (2017) 44–59 consistent with the temperature-dependent strength behaviour of the granite described above. the reason for the initial elastic module increment may be that the specimen becomes more brittle at the initial temperature ranges due to thermally-induced volumetric expansion and the associated pore volume reduction. the later slight reduction of young’s modulus with increasing temperature exhibits an enhancement in ductile behaviour (quasi-brittle characteristics) with further increase of temperature. this is possibly due to the increased crack density caused by the induced thermal crack development and the related weakening of the granite. 600

boundaries, dependent on the anisotropy of the rock matrix (due to potentially existing distinct mineral compounds in granite those may contain different thermo-elastic moduli and this may causes to generate different internal stresses with heating). according to wong and brace (1979), increasing the temperature causes the induction of thermal cracks in the rock mass due to the associated generation of internal stresses (eq. (2)): (2) e(cid:4)˛(cid:4)t = \\u2434 where, e, \\x01␣, \\x01t is the matrix young’s modulus, difference of thermal expansion coefﬁcient of distinct mineral and temperature difference, respectively. when the internal stress (given by eq. (2)) exceeds the crack closure pressure with increasing temperature, thermal cracks form and further increase of temperature provides the surface energy required for the propagation of the initiated crack (zuo et al., 2007). this results in alteration of the grain-tograin contacts in the rock matrix, which leads to reduced cohesion at higher temperatures. in the case of the variation of friction angle with increasing temperature, the granite friction angle appears to remain steady up to around 100 ◦c (52◦) and then slightly increases with increasing temperature (54◦ at 200 and 300 ◦ c, respectively). the friction between grain-to-grain contacts may be altered by the thermally-induced micro-structural modiﬁcations. however, this effect on grain contact is expected to be smaller at relatively low temperatures, resulting in relatively steady friction angle with increasing temperature at lower temperatures. however, a slight ments non-linearity must be taken into account. in addition to the conﬁnement, according to this study, increasing temperature also alters the failure envelope of granite. an initial increment in deviatoric stress with increasing temperature can be observed up to 200 ◦c and further increase of temperature (to 300 ◦c) causes it to be slightly reduced. the temperature-dependent shear parameters of granite were investigated next, and the shear parameters can be obtained from the mohr-coulomb failure envelope. as suggested by singh et al. (2011), the mohr-coulomb parameters (cohesion and friction angle) were calculated using eq. (1), taking into account the linear region of the obtained mohr-coulomb failure envelope (considering only smaller conﬁning stresses, up to 30 mpa) for each temperature condition to obtain the temperature-dependent shear strength parameters (fig. 10).

(continued) enhancement in friction angle with increasing temperature can be seen, probably due to the increased resistance of mineral particles to external deformation as a result of the thermally-induced energy in the mineral particles. however, compared with cohesion, the temperature dependency on friction angle is relatively insigniﬁcant within the temperature region considered here. initial enhancement in shear parameters in sandstone with increasing temperature has been observed by zhang et al. (2015) at relatively low temperature regions, and these researchers observed reduction in friction angle from 33.02◦ to 31.93◦ and an increment a in cohesion from 61.47 mpa to 66.44 mpa with increasing temperature from 25 ◦c to 100 ◦c. further, bauer and johnson (1979) observed around 10% reduction in cohesion and 40% reduction in friction angle in westerly granite with increasing temperature from room temperature to 300 ◦c, and friedman et al. (1979) observed 7% reduction in cohesion and a 38% reduction in friction angle a with increasing temperature from room temperature to 400 ◦c and 300 ◦c, respectively. however, the variation of shear strength parameters with increasing temperature at relatively low temperatures (<300 ◦c) was not considered in the above studies. the observed initial shear strengthening may be due to the inhibition of micro-crack propagation by the plasticity mechanism which occurs at crack tips (duclos and paquet (1991)) at low temperatures. with further increment of temperature, the reduction of shear strength parameters can be expected, due to the thermal weakening of the rock micro-structure. furthermore, according to the sem studies conducted by zuo et al. (2007), large local plastic deformations and extremely rough cleavage fractures occur at relatively low temperatures. moreover, due to the volume expansion, the distance between the interfaces of the individual minerals decreases with the enhancement of their mutual attraction, and the strength of the bonds increases (dmitriev, 1972). both of these phenomena can be considered to explain the stress strengthening of granite under relatively low temperatures when subjected to conﬁning pressures. 3.4. analysis of fracturing behaviour using ae technology acoustic emission (ae) detection technology is a powerful nondestructive tool to study crack propagation processes in brittle materials, including the stages of crack initiation, growth and crack damage (lockner, 1993). when a brittle material is under stress, strain energy is released during the development of new cracks or the widening of existing cracks. this energy is released in the form of elastic stress waves from the crack tips, and can be captured and ampliﬁed by an ae system. ae detection technology has therefore been widely used in a number of previous studies to understand the crack development mechanism in brittle materials (chang and lee, 2004; lei et al., 2000; moura et al., 2005). by incorporating the crack propagation pattern into the stressstrain relationship of the cracking material, the crack development process can be divided into several stages. hoek and bieniawski (1965) divided crack formation into ﬁve main stages: crack closure, crack initiation, secondary cracking, crack coalescence and crack damage. later, ranjith et al. (2008) and shao et al. (2015) incorporated stress-strain curves into cumulative ae counts/energy and strain plots. in the crack propagation process, with the gradual increment of loading on brittle materials, most pre-existing cracks are ﬁrst closed, releasing an insigniﬁcant number of ae counts. this initial crack closure period is followed by the stable crack propagation period, which can be identiﬁed by the release of gradual ae energy increments. further increment of loading causes an exponential increase in ae energy, indicating an unstable crack propagation period with failure approaching. the crack closure threshold ((cid:2)cc) is deﬁned as the stress threshold at which the initial ae counts are identiﬁed. anan initial increment in cumulative ae\\x0c54 w.g.p. kumari et al. / geothermics 65 (2017) 44–59 counts can be seen at the crack initiation ((cid:2)ci) threshold, and the cumulative ae counts starts exponential growth at the crack damage ((cid:2)cd) threshold. the region between the crack closure threshold and the crack initiation threshold is generally deﬁned as the stable crack closure region, where linear elastic deformation occurs. the region between the crack initiation threshold and the crack damage threshold is deﬁned as the stable crack propagation region, and the region between the crack damage threshold and sample failure is identiﬁed as the unstable crack propagation region. the application of compressive loading fails rocks through either shear localization (brittle regime) or cataclastic ﬂow, and the surrounding conditions, such as temperatures and pressures, may cause a homogenous plastic ﬂow. according to existing studies, axial intra-granular cracking and shear rupturing of cemented grain contacts can be observed before failure in brittle regimes, and grain crushing and pore collapse can be identiﬁed before failure in cataclastic ﬂow regimes (menéndez et al., 1996). according to wong et al. (1997), the development of local stress concentrations leads to the initiation of many intra-granular micro-cracks in the rock mass, and the crack density increases with increasing deviatoric stress and tends to merge on reaching the peak stress, resulting in strain softening and shear localization. these damage processes are clearly identiﬁed by the intense ae activities in the ﬁeld (chang and lee, 2004). ae technology was therefore used to investigate the progressive fracturing behaviour in strathbogie granite under tri-axial conditions. fig. 11 illustrates the cumulative ae events with axial stress at various pressures and temperatures for the tested specimens. the corresponding variations of deviatoric stress against strain are also included in the same plots to identify the stress thresholds for crack closure, crack initiation and crack damage (table 4). the very high ae counts in strathbogie granite at dilatancy in the pre-failure stage are due to the fact that ae waves generate when the local shear stress concentration at a grain contact is sufﬁciently high to rupture the grain boundaries, and frictional slips and grain rotations may occur once the grain contacts have lost their cohesion. in the present study, crack threshold ratios were deﬁned to identify the temperature and pressure-dependent crack propagation in the tested granite as follows, and fig. 12 shows the crack propagation stress threshold ratios of granite specimens tested at various conﬁning pressures and temperatures. crack closure stress threshold = deviatoric stress at crack closure stress deviatoric stress at failure ((cid:2)cc) crack initiation stress threshold = deviatoric stress at crack initiation stress deviatoric stress at failure ((cid:2)ci) crack damage stress threshold = deviatoric stress at crack damage stress ((cid:2)cd) deviatoric stress at failure according to the results, the beginning of crack damage occurs at earlier stages of deviatoric loading for higher conﬁning pressures. however, the crack damage stress increases with increasing conﬁnement due to the inﬂuence of conﬁning pressure on thermal crack development and the suppression of the extension/widening of existing micro-cracks. according to fig. 12, in the temperature range considered here, three tendencies can be identiﬁed with increasing conﬁning pressure: increase of the elastic deformation region, decrease of the stable crack propagation region, and increase of the unstable crack propagation region. the crack initiation stress threshold also progressively increases with increasing conﬁning pressure, which can be attributed to the fact that the brittle behaviour of rock specimens at lower conﬁning pressures changes to quasi-brittle behaviour with increasing conﬁning pressure. this is because the suppression of micro-crack development is less at low conﬁning pressures, and therefore sudden failures mostly occur, and the beginning of crack initiation occurs at earlier stages of deviatoric loading at high conﬁning pressures due to the higher normal stress acting on micro-cracks, resulting in limited progression of cracking before failure. in relation to the temperature effect, increasing the temperature causes an initial increment in the crack propagation stress threshold, followed by a slight reduction for all the temperature conditions considered. for example, at 30 mpa conﬁnement, the crack damage stress threshold ratios increased by around 6.8%, 10.5% with increasing temperature from room temperature to 100 and 200 ◦c, respectively, and reduced by around 4.0% when the temperature increased to 300 ◦c. this implies that at low temperatures a suppressed micro-crack development mechanism is dominant, and increasing the temperature causes crack damage to occur at earlier loading stages. interestingly, at 60 mpa conﬁnement the crack damage stress threshold ratio increased by around 4.9%, 5.4%, 2.6% with increasing temperature from room to 100, 200 and 300 ◦c, respectively. this exhibits the cumulative effect of temperature and pressure micro-crack development in the rock mass. at relatively low temperatures, micro-crack propagation may be inhibited by the thermally-induced plasticity mechanism which occurs at crack tips and the increased bonding strength through thermally-induced rock matrix expansion (which increases crack stress thresholds). however, further increase of temperature creates thermally-induced cracks and causes the grain boundary cracks to widen, resulting in early crack damage. further, with the inﬂuence of conﬁnement, micro-crack development is suppressed, causing a relatively low increment of crack damage stress threshold ratios at higher conﬁnements. 3.5. corresponding alterations in granite micro-structure a comprehensive micro-structural analysis was also performed to identify the interior correspondences of the above-described temperature-dependent mechanical behaviour of granite. sem and optical microscopic analyses were performed on thin sections of granite specimens at various temperatures: room temperature (20 ◦c), pre-heated (72 hours) to 200 ◦c and 400 ◦c (fig. 13). these temperatures were selected to identify the microstructural behaviour at 200 ◦c, at which the highest strength increment was observed, and 400 ◦c, at which clear thermally-induced rock mass weakening was observed. a specimen at room temperature was used as a control. based on optical microscope imaging, mineralogical assembling in the granite specimen could be identiﬁed by the colour and texture of each of the mineral assemblages. further, a detailed sem study was performed using scanning electron imaging (sei) and bsei back-scatter electron imaging (bsei) techniques. bsei images taken at low magniﬁcations clearly show different mineral assemblages and grain boundaries (see fig. 14). using energy-dispersive x-ray (edx) technology with aztec oxford instruments, chemical component mapping was generated in each specimen, and each mineral was identiﬁed qualitatively. the bright colour images observed in edx images indicate higher concentration (higher energy dispersion) while dark colour areas indicate lower concentration (lower energy dispersion). based on the spectrum of each point (point id), the corresponding mineral was identiﬁed and a map spectrum provided overall elements available for each specimen. according to figs. 13 and 14, there are clear mineralogical assembling in the granite specimens, mainly with quartz, kfeldspar and plagioclase. the heating of granite up to 200 ◦c temperature has not caused any signiﬁcant thermally-induced micro-cracks (in addition to the pre-existing faults and grain boundaries) and almost all grain boundaries remain intact. however, further heating of granite to the higher temperature of 400 ◦c caused the induction of some micro-cracks, mainly along\\x0cw.g.p. kumari et al. / geothermics

however, only a few grain\\x0c56 w.g.p. kumari et al. / geothermics 65 (2017) 44–59 fig. 13. optical microscopic and sem images of thin sections of strathbogie granite (a) at room temperature; (b) pre-heated to 100 ◦c (c) pre-heated to 400 ◦c. boundaries have been partially parted and a signiﬁcant number of grain boundaries appear to remain intact up to this temperature. furthermore, based on the edx mapping, it was conﬁrmed that intra-granular cracks are mainly initiated along the feldspar and quartz minerals. intragranular cracks were mainly observed in larger crystals (crystals greater than 0.5 mm) and smaller crystals remained un-parted even at 400 ◦c. for strathbogie granite, thermally-induced intra-granular micro-cracks seem to play a signiﬁcant role at relatively low temperatures, probably due to the presence of relatively high k feldspar and biotite contents. similar observations have been reported in bauer and johnson’s (1979) study conducted for charcoal granite, where intra-granular microcracks predominantly occur compared to grain boundary cracks. the sem analysis is also consistent with this ﬁnding, which exhibits inhibition of micro-crack development followed by micro-cracking at relatively high temperatures. the crack propagation process in any rock mass is largely inﬂuenced by the mineralogical composition, because cracks normally propagate through weaker planes of the rock mass. since granite is an igneous type of rock, two main types of thermallyinduced cracking modes can be identiﬁed: inter-granular and intragranular. the amount of inter-granular or intra-granular cracking is dependent on the stress state, rock type and mineralogy of the rock mass. inter-granular cracks occur along grain boundaries, pre-existing faults and micro-cracks of the rock, while intragranular cracks occur through weaker mineralogical constituents (kranz, 1983). for example, k feldspar and biotite are weaker mineralogical constituents due to their large crystals (>10 mm), as crystals greater than 2–3 mm in size are generally deﬁned as weaker mineralogical constituents compared to equi-dimensional small crystals like quartz (homand-etienne and houpert, 1989). based on experimental results, intra-granular cracking is highly temperature-dependent due to the temperature dependent dislocations in the rocks. this is because different mineralogical components have different thermo-elastic moduli and thermal conductivities (kranz, 1983; dwivedi et al., 2008). these observations suggest that micro-cracking in granite is highly temperature dependent, as evidenced by the previously observed initial strength gain followed by slight strength reduction with increasing temperature in the tested granite. however, this shows that granite needs to be heated to a sufﬁcient temperature to cause thermal cracks in it and therefore, heating to a lower temperature may only cause a strength gain through the thermal expansion of the rock matrix. this is consistent with the results of bauer and johnson (1979). the mechanical properties of charcoal granite in their study remained relatively steady until 200 ◦c, and westerly granite exhibited a signiﬁcant thermal dependency, even at relatively low temperatures (<200 ◦c). in homand-etienne and houpert (1989) study, the variation of uni-axial compressive strength of both semones and remiremont granites is insigniﬁcant until 400 ◦c, followed by signiﬁcant reductions at higher temperatures. these results indicate the dependency of mineralogical composition and grain size distribution on the temperature dependent mechanical behaviour in various types of granites. however,\\x0cw.g.p. kumari et al. / geothermics 65 (2017) 44–59 57 fig. 14. bse images of strathbogie

granite under four different conﬁning pressures (10, 30, 60, 90 mpa) and four different temperatures (rt, 100, 200, 300 ◦c), simulating various geothermal reservoir conditions. the following conclusions can be drawn: mechanical behaviour of the tested granite is inﬂuenced by both reservoir depth and temperature, and the depth effect is much greater than the temperature effect. granite located at relatively smaller depths appears to fail through shear localization and increasing depth may cause this to change to ductile failure through strain hardening. a progressive enhancement in stress threshold with increasing conﬁning pressure is observed in strathbogie granite. such behaviours exhibit greater strength and lower brittle characteristics in granite located at greater depths. increasing of temperature causes granite’s strength to be enhanced up to a certain temperature (around 200 ◦c for strathbogie granite) through the possible thermal expansion of the rock matrix and further increasing of temperature may cause it to weaken by inducing thermal cracks. this was conﬁrmed by the micro-structural analysis, which did not reveal any noticeable amount of thermally-induced micro-cracking in strathbogie granite up to 200 ◦c, and heating of the granite to a greater temperature as 400 ◦c caused many intra-granular cracks in quartz and feldspar and some grain boundary cracks between quartz and feldspar minerals. furthermore, according to ae analysis, increasing the temperature ﬁrst causes the crack propagation stress threshold to increase and further increasing of the temperature causes it to be slightly reduced. this indicates a suppression of micro-cracks at low temperatures by matrix expansion and the development of micro-cracks through thermally-induced damage at higher temperatures. finally an attempt was made to improve the conventional mohrcoulomb failure criteria for geothermal reservoirs with extreme pressures and temperatures, because the conventional criteria are not applicable to extreme conditions. acknowledgements this research project is funded by the australian research council (arc dp160104223) and the authors would like to

the present study may therefore capture more realistic geothermal reservoir behaviour. 3.6. temperature-dependent failure criteria for strathbogie granite ≤ (3) − is questionable, due to the to date, although many strength criteria are available for intact rock, the practical application of most of them for geothermal reservoirs in-situ model parameters required when considering the available high-pressure and high-temperature environment in underground reservoirs. of the various failure criteria, the mohr-coulomb failure criteria have been extensively used in the ﬁeld and have made a signiﬁcant contribution to the determination of rock mass failure. however, they have some major limitations, including ignoring the intermediate stress (cid:2)2 inﬂuence (which has been proven to have a substantial inﬂuence on rock strength) and the assumed linearity (the strength criteria of rock are non-linear in reality). after re-analyzing thousands of reported triaxial experiments and combining the critical state concept proposed by barton (1976), singh et al. (2011) proposed a non-linear mohr-coulomb failure criterion. according to the ﬁndings of singh et al. (2011), the mohr-coulomb shear strength parameters should only be obtained by performing conventional tri-axial tests under low conﬁning stresses (in the linear region of the mohr-coulomb failure envelope). according to their statistical analysis, (cid:2)cc ≈ (cid:2)crit, where (cid:2)c and (cid:2) crit are uni-axial compressive strength and critical conﬁning pressure, respectively. the modiﬁed mohr-coulomb failure criterion proposed by singh et al. is given below: (cid:2)1 − (cid:2)3 = where, (cid:2)ci ≈ (cid:2)ci + 2sin(cid:3)i0 sin(cid:3)i0 ucs of the rock = 2ciocos(cid:3)i0/1 sin(cid:3)i0, (cid:3)i0 and cio are friction angle and cohesion obtained at low conﬁning pressures. sin(cid:3)i0) (cid:2)32 2sin(cid:3)i0 (cid:2)3 ≤ (cid:2)3 − (cid:2)crit (1 for 0 (cid:2)crit − − 1 however, even the improved mohr-coulomb failure criteria cannot be directly applied to geothermal reservoir rocks at extreme pressures and temperatures, because the strength response is altered by the thermal effect (heuze, 1983). to date, no extensive study has captured this thermal response in the improved mohrcoulomb failure criteria. such a realistic approach is necessary for deep underground engineering applications like geothermal energy extraction. the concepts of barton (1976) and singh et al. (2011) are therefore incorporated into the temperature inﬂuence in this study and an attempt is made to propose novel strength criteria for geothermal reservoir rocks based on experimental data: + 2sin(cid:3)i (t) sin(cid:3)i (t) (cid:2)3 − − 1 − (cid:2)3 (t) = 2ci (t) cos(cid:3)i (t) sin(cid:3)i (t) 1 (cid:2)1 − (4) (cid:2)3 ≤ (cid:2)crit ≤ sin(cid:3)i (t)) (cid:2)32 for 0 − (cid:2)crit (t) (1

wang, 2014). site selection for china's hlw repository started in 1985 (wang, 2010). the efforts have been focused on potential hlw repository sites located within granite intrusions in mainland china. since 1999, the beijing research ⁎ corresponding author. e-mail address: xingguang100@126.com (x.g. zhao). http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tecto.2016.06.021 0040-1951/© 2016 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved. institute of uranium geology (briug) has performed site characterization studies in the beishan area, china. so far, the beishan area has been considered as the most potential candidate area for china's hlw repository. among all the engineering properties of crystalline rocks at a potential hlw repository site, the thermal conductivity is one of the most important parameters in design consideration because it has a direct impact on the evaluation of the necessary repository volume and the optimization of the repository layout (sundberg and hellström, 2009). for instance, in the swedish kbs-3 concept for geological disposal of spent fuel, copper canisters with cast iron inserts containing the spent fuel are surrounded by bentonite for isolation and mechanical protection (, 2006). the heat generated by the spent fuel will increase the temperature of all components of the repository. for the bentonite buffer outside the canisters, the peak temperature must not exceed 100 °c. this requirement implies that the canisters cannot be deposited arbitrarily close to each other. on the other hand, unnecessarily large distances between the canisters will mean inefﬁcient and costly use of the repository rock volume (, 2009). to fulﬁll the temperature requirement, the rocks with low thermal conductivities will\\x0cx.g.  / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137 125 lead to a larger distance between canisters than for a case with high thermal conductivities. this is because the rocks with low thermal conductivities will give rise to higher temperatures in the bentonite (, 2008). hence, to design and construct repositories successfully, it is essential to perform an accurate assessment of the thermal conductivity characteristics of the host rock. over the past few decades, various experimental approaches have been employed to measure the thermal conductivity of rocks. the results indicate that the thermal conductivity of rocks is closely associated with mineral composition, porosity, texture, and density, etc. (birch and clark, 1940; clauser and huenges, 1995; , 2005; , 2004; , 2015; , 2007; , 2009). for crystalline rocks with relatively homogeneous texture and low porosity, the mineral composition dominates the thermal conductivity. in volcanic and sedimentary rocks, the high variability of porosity in these rocks is a major factor controlling the thermal conductivity (clauser and huenges, 1995; , 2004). for example, increasing porosity, which acts as barrier to the ﬂow of heat, often results in both lower p-wave velocity and lower thermal conductivity values (, 2004). for a given rock, water content and temperature have an inﬂuence on its thermal conductivity. generally, the thermal conductivity of the rock increases and decreases with increasing water content (cho and kwon, 2010; , 2009) and temperature (, 2009; birch and clark, 1940; heuze, 1983; , 2014; , 2008; vosteen and schellschmidt, 2003), respectively. moreover, the effect of water saturation on the thermal conductivity of rocks shows a generally increasing trend with increasing porosity (nagaraju and roy, 2014). given that the thermal conductivity of surrounding rocks around the excavations will be changed by the excavation-induced stress, some researchers studied the inﬂuence of pressure on the thermal conductivity of rocks (, 2010; , 2009; , 2004; , 2008; sibbitt, 1976; walsh and decker, 1966; zimmerman, 1989). one of the main ﬁndings achieved from these investigations shows that the thermal conductivity varies with the pressure exerted on the rock. with increasing applied pressure, the thermal conductivity starts to increase and subsequently the increase rate tends to be a constant value due to gradual closure of cracks and pores within the rock (, 2008; walsh and decker, 1966). while the above-mentioned studies provide meaningful insight into the thermal conductivity of various rocks, the thermal conductivity characteristics of low-porosity crystalline rocks subjected to different external factors such as water saturation, temperature and compression stress have not been fully understood. on the other hand, the information on the thermal conductivity of rocks in a potential hlw repository site must be known with sufﬁcient conﬁdence to provide necessary input conditions for its long-term safety assessment, which is one of the motivations for this study. in this work, experimental investigations on the thermal conductivity of the beishan granitic rocks are conducted using the transient plane source (tps) method. in the following discussion, rock sampling and basic physical properties of the rock specimens are introduced ﬁrst. testing facilities and procedures are then described. subsequently, the water saturation, temperature and compression stress dependent thermal conductivity characteristics of the tested rocks are evaluated comprehensively, and ﬁnally some insights are obtained. 2. rock sampling and preparation the beishan area is situated in gansu province of northwestern china (see fig. 1). after a long geological evolution and weathering process, the topography of this area is characterized by a ﬂat gobi and small gentle rolling hills with elevations ranging between 1400 and 2000 m above the sea level. the crust in this area possesses a blocky structure with many granite intrusions (see fig. 2). other surrounding rocks include mainly metamorphic and sedimentary rocks, as well as quaternary cover. rock sampling was carried out in the jijicao and xinchang rock blocks, which are currently considered as two of the key investigation sub-areas during site selection and characterization. fig. 1. geographical location of the beishan area and a photo showing its typical topography.\\x0c126 x.g.  / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137 xinchang bs06 bs18 bs19 jijicao bs16 bs15 bs05 n 2.5 km granitic rock sedimentary rock metamorphic rock quaternary cover borehole fault fig. 2. rock sampling from six boreholes in the jijicao and xinchang sub-areas for thermal conductivity measurements. intact drill cores with a diameter of approximately 63 mm were taken from six sub-vertical boreholes (i.e., boreholes bs05, bs06, bs15, bs16, bs18 and bs19) in these two sub-areas. the borehole locations are presented in fig. 2. field observations indicated that the collected granitic rocks were relatively isotropic in texture and mineralogical composition. to evaluate the geological nature of the rocks, a series of thin sections were prepared and then exposed to cross-polarized light under an optical microscope to identify the dominant minerals in the rocks. the percentages of the dominant minerals were determined by point counting on thin sections. for each thin section approximately 500 points covering phenocrysts and groundmass were counted. according to the quartz-alkali feldspar-plagioclase (qap) diagram (streckeisen, 1976), the rocks can further be classiﬁed. it can be observed from fig. 3 that the rocks contain mainly a moderate to low amount of quartz and alkali feldspar, and a moderate to high amount of plagioclase. this means that the collected rocks dominantly range from granodiorite to monzogranite. for grain size characteristics, the rocks are from ﬁne grained to, medium to coarse grained. an overview of the basic information of the rocks is listed in table 1. based on the borehole no. and sampling depth, these rocks have been divided into eight groups. a total of 47 pairs of rock specimens, 50 mm in diameter, were prepared from the drill cores with a length to diameter ratio of approximately 0.5. in particular, specimen ends were polished carefully using a q 90 90 i granodiorite ii monzogranite 60 60 ii i bs05 bs06 bs15 bs16 bs18-1 bs18-2 bs19-1 bs19-2 20 20 5 5 p 10 35 65 90 a fig. 3. qap classiﬁcation of the eight rock groups based on modal analysis. grinding machine until the ﬂatness and roughness of the ends are less than 10 μm and 3 μm, respectively. the ﬂat and polished specimen end surfaces minimize the thermal contact resistance during thermal conductivity measurement. a minimum of ten specimens for each rock group were prepared. 3. test methodology 3.1. an introduction to the used tps method in the ﬁelds of geology and geophysics, laboratory approaches to measuring soil and rock thermal conductivity can mainly be divided into two groups: steady state and transient state. in this work, the transient plane source (tps) method (gustafsson, 1991; log and gustafsson, 1995) was utilized to measure the thermal conductivity of the specimens. as one of the transient measurement methods, the tps technique is based on the use of a transiently heated plane sensor (i.e., hot disk sensor) and a hot disk thermal constants analyser (see fig. 4a). the used hot disk tps2500s system can measure thermal conductivity of materials ranging from 0.01 to 400 w/mk. the hot disk sensor consists of a continuous double spiral, which is etched out of a thin nickel foil (fig. 4e). this spiral is sandwiched between two sheets of electrical insulation materials made of kapton. the sensor acts both as a heat source for increasing the temperature of the specimens and as a dynamic temperature sensor for recording the temperature increase. during the measurement, the temperature in the sensor rises and heat starts to ﬂow to the specimens. the temperature rise in the sensor provides an indicator of the thermal properties of the specimens. if the specimens have good thermal conducting properties, the heat will be transported rapidly inside the specimens. on the contrary, if the specimens have good thermal insulation properties, the sensor temperature will rise faster and the heat will not be transported as much as in the test of the good thermal conducting specimens. compared with steady state measurement methods such as the divided bar (beck and beck, 1958; birch, 1950; , 1971) and the guarded hot plate (, 2009; , 2012), one of significant advantages of the tps technique is that the thermal conductivity of materials can be measured more quickly, typically from several to tens of seconds. hence, a long wait for thermal gradients to equilibrate is not required and the moisture migration in response to temperature gradients was minimized (jackson and taylor, 1986). on the other hand, unlike some transient methods such as thermal needle probes (barry-, 2013; von herzen and maxwell, 1959), which are commonly used for soils and soft rocks, the tps method can be\\x0cx.g.  / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137 127 table 1 basic information and geological description of the tested rocks. rock type and group basic information mineral composition naked eye observation photomicrograph of a thin section monzogranite (bs05) location: jijicao borehole no.: bs05 sampling depth: 5–7 m number of specimen pairs: 7 grain size: medium plagioclase: 33.7% ± 5.8%;

, 2003). hence, the thermal resistance between the specimen ends and the sensor exists (see section 3.2). so far, the tps technology has been widely used to\\x0c128 x.g.  / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137 a c temperature control system b hot disk thermal constants analyser sensor platen specimens d e specimens insulation material chamber sensor specimens oil bath sensor double spiral cable extension fig. 4. the hot disk tps2500s system (a) used to measure the thermal conductivity of specimens under room temperature (d), high temperature (c), and uniaxial compression (b) conditions. a hot disk sensor showing its key components (e). determine the thermal properties of different materials (, 2015; , 2008; urquhart and bauer, 2015; , 2014; , 2012). 3.2. theory of the tps technique to theoretically describe how the tps method behaves, the thermal conductivity equation can be solved assuming that the hot disk sensor consists of a certain number of concentric ring heat sources located in an inﬁnitely large sample (hot disk, 2007). a constant electric power supplied to the sensor results in an increase in temperature which is directly related to the variation in the sensor resistance (r(t)) by the equation: \\x10 \\x11 r tð þ ¼ r0 1 þ αδt τð þ ð1þ where r0 is the nickel electrical resistance in the beginning of the recording, α is the temperature coefﬁcient of resistance of the nickel foil, and δtðτþ is the mean value of temperature rise in the sensor due to a constant current pulse given by: \\x10 δt τð þ ¼ p0 π3=2ak \\x11−1d τð þ ð2þ where p0 is the total output of power from the sensor, a is the sensor radius, k is the thermal conductivity of the sample that is being tested and d(τ) is a dimensionless time dependent function with: τ ¼ t=θð ð3þ þ1=2; θ ¼ a2=d where t is the time measured from the start of the transient recording, θ is the characteristic time, which depends both on parameters of the sensor and the sample, and d is the thermal diffusivity of the sample. according to eq. (2), and δtðτþ and d(τ) plotted as a function of τ provides a linear relationship with a slope that is a function of p0, a, and k. thermal conductivity k can be obtained by ﬁtting the experimental data to the straight line given by eq. (2); thermal diffusivity d is calculated from eq. (3) taking into account the τ value determined in the previous ﬁt. as mentioned above, the solution of the thermal conductivity equation is based on the assumption that the hot disk sensor is located in an inﬁnite material in perfect contact with the sensor surface. this means that the heat ﬂow generated from each measurement must not reach the outside boundaries of the specimen (hot disk, 2007). meanwhile, a careful preparation of specimen ends is required to minimize thermal contact resistance. an estimation of how far the heat ﬂow has proceeded in the specimen during a recording is the probing depth δp, which is deﬁned as (hot disk, 2007): ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ p dt δp ¼ 2 ð4þ to determine the thermal conductivity with good accuracy, the shortest distance from any part of the sensor to the nearest outside boundary of the sample should be larger than δp. in our experiments, the used hot disk sensor has a radius of 6.403 mm. the shortest distance is about 19 mm, and the probing depth is approximately 10 mm. for this probing depth value, we can consider that we are conducting a bulk measurement. 3.3. test procedures 3.3.1. tests on specimens under saturated and dry conditions firstly, the specimens were immersed by deionized water in a vacuum for a period of 96 h. the specimens were then taken from the vacuum and the water droplets on the surfaces were wiped dry, care being taken to ensure that no rock grains or fragments were lost. the mass of the water-saturated specimens (msat) was measured using a\\x0cx.g.  / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137 129 loading measurement 60 50

specimens were saturated with water. subsequently, the hot disk sensor was horizontally placed between the two saturated specimen pieces with the double spiral centered and totally covered, and the two specimen pieces were ﬁrmly clamped together to ensure that there was no air gap between the sensor and the specimen end surfaces, as presented in fig. 4d. in order to remain water saturation, the saturated specimens and the sensor were kept in a plastic bag during thermal conductivity measurement (adl-zarrabi, 2004). after the test, the used water-saturated specimens were suffered from dehydration treatment in a thermostatic drying oven at 105 °c for a period of 24 h and subsequently cooled in a desiccator to measure the thermal conductivity under a dry condition. meanwhile, the mass of the dry specimens (mdry) was measured, and the porosity (n) of the specimens was calculated using the equations n ¼ 100v p v % v p ¼ msat − mdry ρw ð5þ ð6þ where v is the bulk rock volume, vp is the pore volume, and ρw is the density of water. for each pair of specimens saturated or dried, measurements on the thermal conductivity were carried out at room temperature (25 ± 1 °c). 3.3.2. tests on specimens under increasing temperature to investigate the effect of temperature on the thermal conductivity of the tested rocks, measurements were performed on dry specimens from 40 °c to 150 °c based on the requirements of the used test equipment. compared with measurements at room temperature, the experiments under high temperature are time consuming due to a slow stepwise heating process by using a constant temperature oil bath and a temperature control system, as shown in fig. 4c. the thermal conductivity measurement can only be conducted until the two specimen pieces in the chamber with a specimen holder within the oil bath have reached thermal equilibrium and kept a target temperature value. during thermal equilibrium of the oil bath, the hot disk sensor monitors continuously the temperature variation of the specimens. for our tests, the thermal conductivity of the specimens was measured when the recorded temperature variation of the specimens is less than 0.04 °c. in general, 32 h were needed to complete one test. a typical temperature-time history during the test is presented in fig. 6. it should variation of specimen temperature (oc) 0.35 0.30 0.25

each incremental stress level. after each measurement, the load was maintained constant for a period of about 15 min to avoid residual temperature drifts on the specimens. based on the in-situ stress measurement results obtained from the beishan area (, 2013), the maximum axial compression stress applied to the specimens was set to be 45 mpa to approximately simulate the excavation-induced stress near the vertical hlw disposal element boundary at a depth of 600 m. the axial stress applied to the specimens was recorded automatically, and the used stress path throughout the course of testing is presented in fig. 7. the experiments were conducted at room temperature. according to previous experimental results (, 2015a; , 2015b), the identiﬁed crack initiation stresses of cylindrical specimens of beishan granitic rocks under uniaxial compression using the cumulative ae hit (caeh) method range from 45.3 to 109.1 mpa, which are larger than the maximum compression stress adopted in the present study. hence, the stress-induced rock damage might not occur in the tested specimens during loading. it should be mentioned that in the process of loading, the friction may occur at the interfaces between the specimen ends and the sensor. due to limitation of the tps measurement technique, the utilized test method does not consider the potential inﬂuence of interface friction effect on the experimental results. to reduce or eliminate the friction effect, further efforts are needed to produce innovative design for the test equipment. although not perfect, the developed test system provides a feasible means for us to gain insight into thermal conductivity behaviors of rocks under compression. 4. test results 4.1. inﬂuence of water saturation on the thermal conductivity table 2

water-saturated specimens were not adopted in this test because little was known about how the gradual heating and the thermal equilibrium processes would affect the water content of the specimens, leading to difﬁculties in evaluating the relationship between the thermal conductivity and the water saturation degree of the specimens quantitatively. 3.3.3. tests on specimens under uniaxial compression the uniaxial compression tests on dry specimens were conducted using a hydraulic servo-controlled compression machine. for each test, two specimen pieces with the hot disk sensor were contained between steel platens machined to match their end surfaces, as shown in fig. 4b. the interfaces between the specimens and the steel platens were daubed with a thin layer of lubricant to reduce the end effect of the platens during loading. when the experimental setup was completed, axial-load control was used with a loading rate of 100 n/s and the axial load was increased with an increment thermal conductivity measurements were carried out on the 40 pairs of specimens both in dry and water-saturated conditions, and the results are listed in table 2. a statistical analysis shows that for the eight rock groups under dry or saturated state, the standard deviation (sd) and coefﬁcient of variation (cov) of the thermal conductivity are all less than 0.06 w/mk and 4%, respectively, indicating that the results between specimens in each rock group have a good consistency. for all rock groups, the average thermal conductivity values in the dry state (kdry) range between 2.412 and 2.812 w/mk. the values under watersaturated condition (ksat) for the same set of specimens range from 130 x.g.  / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137\\x0cx.g.  / tectonophysics 683

tested rocks have an average porosity range from 0.40% to 1.37%. when the dry specimens were saturated with water, water with a higher thermal conductivity (0.604 w/mk) replaced the air with a lower thermal conductivity (0.025 w/mk) in the void of the rocks, leading to an increase of the thermal conductivity. for our data set, the mean thermal conductivity values of the saturated specimens in different rocks groups range from 6.5% to 24.2% higher than those of dry ones. as presented in fig. 8, for the rock groups (i.e., bs06, bs16, bs18-1, bs18-2, bs19-1 and bs19-2) with an average

conductivity of the specimens shows a decaying trend with increasing temperature, and the values at 150 °c range from 5.7% to 8.7% lower than those at room temperature. this means that within the used temperature range, the inﬂuence of the increasing temperature on the decay of thermal conductivity for these rocks is limited. on the other hand, a possible reason for the gradual decrease in thermal conductivity is the generation of thermally induced microcracks in the rocks because of a mismatch between thermal expansion coefﬁcients of adjacent mineral grains in a homogeneous temperature ﬁeld (, 1993), which has been demonstrated from a microcracking perspective based on numerical simulations (zhao, 2016). based on the experimental data, the relationship between thermal conductivity and temperature can be described using the equation: k ¼ kr − at2 ð8þ where kr is the thermal conductivity of the rock at room temperature (25 °c), t is the temperature in celsius, and a is the ﬁt coefﬁcient (see table 3). the parameter a affects the decaying velocity of the thermal conductivity with the temperature, i.e., the decaying velocity of the thermal conductivity increases as a increases. as shown in table 3, a in eq. (8) varies from rock to rock and can be determined only using laboratory tests. in order to develop a model for predicting a, individual fit overall fit (model) bs15-07 bs18-1-08 bs06-05 bs18-2-05 bs19-1-05 bs05-07 bs16-05 2.9 2.8 2.7 2.6 2.5 2.4 2.3 2.2 thermal conductivity (w/mk) 0 20 40 80 60 100 temperature (oc) 120 140 160 fig. 13. comparison of overall ﬁt using the temperature and rock porosity dependent thermal conductivity model and individual ﬁt of seven pairs of specimens in different rock groups. behavior. however, with further increase of rock porosity, the approximately linear relationship between kdry and ksat is not valid anymore. for example, the rock groups bs05 and bs15 with average porosity values greater than or equal to 0.68% exhibit higher thermal conductivity in the water-saturated state relative to the dry state. to evaluate the thermal conductivity of rocks, various mixing models such as the geometric mean (lichtenecker, 1924), the arithmetic mean (voigt, 1928), the hashin–shtrikman mean (hashin and shtrikman, 1962), and the effective-medium mean (bruggeman, 1935; clauser, 2009) have been proposed. comprehensive overviews and case studies on such mixing models can be found in (, 2009; clauser, 2009; , 2013; hartmann, 2005; , 2015). based on the experimental data (see table 2) in combination with the methodology used by  (2013), the abovementioned mixing models were used to predict the thermal conductivity values of the tested rocks in the water-saturated state. fig. 9 shows the comparison between measured and calculated thermal conductivities for the four different models. it can be observed from fig. 9a, b, and d that the geometric mean, the arithmetic mean, and the effectivemedium mean yield similar prediction results and consistently underestimate the thermal conductivity of the eight rock groups, especially for the groups with relatively high porosity values (e.g., groups bs05 and bs15). the hashin–shtrikman mean shows a reasonably good ﬁt for all rock groups, as shown in fig. 9c. the analysis results are basically in line with observations reported by  (2013) because most of the evaluated mixing models used in their analysis also underestimate the thermal conductivity of the rocks. however, the geometric mean model was rated as the best ﬁt to their data set. it should be noted that the rocks used in their analysis covered different rock types with a large range in porosity, from almost zero to about 30%. in addition, the measured thermal conductivity values of these rocks spans the interval between 1.0 and 6.5 w/mk. the present investigations focused mainly on the granitic rocks with low porosities and a narrow thermal conductivity range. hence, the large difference of rock properties may result in uncertainties between analysis results obtained from various mixing models. more work is required to explain this discrepancy. nagaraju and roy (2014) deﬁned the effect of water saturation on thermal conductivity (s) as a function of porosity of rocks, and s is expressed by s ¼ ksat − kdry ð7þ kdry according to the measurement results listed in table 2, we established the relationship between s and the porosity of the rocks, as presented in fig. 10. analysis of fig. 10 reveals that the effect of water saturation on thermal conductivity of rocks presents an increasing trend with an increase of porosity. a linear form expression can ﬁt the data reasonably well while ensuring that the line passes through the origin. 4.2. inﬂuence of temperature on the thermal conductivity fig. 11 presents the variation of thermal conductivity of seven pairs of dry specimens in different rock groups with temperature from 40 °c table 3 fit coefﬁcient a for thermal conductivity-temperature curves of seven pairs of specimens in different rock groups. rock type and specimen no. monzogranite (bs05-07) granodiorite (bs06-05) monzogranite (bs15-07) granodiorite (bs16-05) monzogranite (bs18-1-08) granodiorite (bs18-2-05) monzogranite (bs19-1-07) a (10−6) 8.821 5.679 8.394 4.871 6.891 5.728 6.385 r2 0.9830 0.9334 0.9853 0.9289 0.9262 0.9581 0.9933 132 x.g.  / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137\\x0cx.g.  / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137 133 n=2 20 10 axial stress (mpa) 30 40 n=3 20 10 axial stress (mpa) 30 40 50 50 3.4 3.3 3.2 3.1 3.0 2.9 2.8 2.7 2.6 2.5 2.4 c thermal conductivity (w/mk) 50 0 f 2.9 2.8 2.7 2.6 2.5 2.4 thermal conductivity (w/mk) 50 0 n=3 20 10 axial stress (mpa) 30 40 n=3 20 10 axial stress (mpa) 30 40 bs05 bs06 bs15 bs16 bs18-1 bs18-2 bs19-1 bs19-2 y=24.15-24.99e-x (r2=0.9296) 21 18 15 12 0369 i r(%) n=1 20 10 axial stress (mpa) 30 40 50 0.0 0.3 0.9 1.2 0.6 porosity (%) 1.5 1.8 b 3.0 2.9 2.8 2.7 2.6 2.5 2.4 thermal conductivity (w/mk) 50 0 3.2e 3.1 3.0 2.9 2.8 2.7 2.6 2.5 2.4 thermal conductivity (w/mk) 50 0 3.2h 3.1 3.0 2.9 2.8 2.7 2.6 thermal conductivity (w/mk) 50 0 n=3 20 10 axial stress (mpa) 30 40 n=3 20 10 axial stress (mpa) 30 40 n=2 20 10 axial stress (mpa) 30 40 3.0 2.9 2.8 2.7 2.6 2.5 2.4 2.3 2.2 a thermal conductivity (w/mk) 3.0d 2.9 2.8 2.7 2.6 2.5 2.4 2.3 2.2 2.1 2.0 thermal conductivity (w/mk) 3.0g 2.9 2.8 2.7 2.6 2.5 2.4 thermal conductivity (w/mk) 0 0 0 fig. 14. inﬂuence of axial compression stress on the thermal conductivity of the eight rock groups: (a) bs05, (b) bs06, (c) bs15, (d) bs16, (e) bs18-1, (f) bs18-2, (g) bs19-1 and (h) bs19-2, and variation of the increase rate of the thermal conductivity (r) with rock porosity (i). error bars indicate the standard deviation of the thermal conductivity. n in the ﬁgures represents the number of specimen pairs in each rock group. we attempted to relate a with other rock parameters and found that a depended on the magnitude of rock porosity (n), as presented in fig. 12. the coefﬁcient a varies with porosity n according to the following equation: a ¼ 9:43 − 0:71=n2 ð9þ according to eqs.

(11) is not sensitive to the variation of rock porosity, and is within the range from 0.20 to 0.27 except for the rock group bs19-1. for simplicity, an average value of c = 0.24 obtained from table 4 is used to approximately describe the trend, as shown in fig. 15b. using eqs. (11)–(12) and the constant coefﬁcient c, an overall ﬁt is made for these rock groups to reproduce the rock porosity-dependent thermal conductivity under different axial stresses. a comparison between individual and overall ﬁt results is presented in fig. 16. it is found that for each rock group subjected to different compression stresses, the difference of the thermal conductivity values from the individual and overall ﬁts is less than 0.05 w/mk. the good agreement indicates that the established rock porosity-dependent model can capture the nonlinear stress-thermal conductivity relationships of the beishan granitic rocks satisfactorily. 5. discussion one of the ﬁndings from the experimental investigations in the previous sections is that the rock porosity has an inﬂuence on the thermal conductivity of the beishan granitic rocks under water saturation, increasing temperature and compression stress conditions, although the porosity of tested rocks is relatively low. it is well known that for low-porosity crystalline rocks, the mineral composition plays an important role in dominating the thermal conductivity. the crystalline rocks are mainly made up of quartz, feldspars, and maﬁc minerals such as pyroxene, amphibole and biotite, and the content of minerals from these three mineral groups basically determines a rock's thermal conductivity (clauser and huenges, 1995). as mentioned in section 2, a model analysis on a total of 46 thin sections of the rocks was conducted to identify the dominant minerals in the rocks. as listed in table 1, the main minerals of these rocks include quartz, plagioclase, k-feldspar and biotite. among these four minerals, quartz has the highest thermal conductivity (7.69 w/mk) while another three minerals have a thermal conductivity range between 1.70 and 2.29 w/mk (horai, 1971). hence, when the porosity values of the specimens in different rock groups are close to each other, quartz content in the rocks may determine the thermal conductivity. according to the data listed in table 2, fig. 17a presents the inﬂuence of quartz content on the average thermal conductivity of different rock groups in dry state. it is seen that except for rock groups bs05 and bs15 (which have relatively large porosity values of 1.37% and 0.68%, respectively), thermal conductivity of the rocks appears an increasing trend with increasing quartz content. when the specimens are subjected to compression stresses, the original pores and cracks in the rocks tend to close, and the effective contact areas between mineral grains increase, leading to a signiﬁcant decay of the porosity effect on the thermal conductivity, especially for rocks with relatively high porosity. on the other hand, the closure of pores and cracks increases the contact opportunity of quartz grains, and hence improves the transportation capability of heat ﬂow in the rocks. under this condition, an obvious increase of the thermal conductivity for all rock groups with increasing quartz content can be observed, as presented in fig. 17b. 6. conclusions beishan granitic rocks are candidate host rock types for china's hlw repository. in this paper, thermal conductivity characteristics of the beishan granitic rocks have been investigated using the transient plane source (tps) method. the measurement results indicate that for the used eight rock groups with a porosity range from 0.40% to 1.37%, the average thermal conductivity values in the dry state range between 2.412 and 2.812 w/mk. the values under water-saturated condition range from 2.602 to 3.156 w/mk. meanwhile, the effect of water saturation on thermal conductivity presents an increasing trend with an increase of rock porosity. using several mixing models proposed by previous researchers, we found that the hashin–shtrikman mean model showed a reasonably good ﬁt to the experimental data while another three models currently obtained data, a best ﬁtting equation of axial stressdependent thermal conductivity for these rocks can be expressed as (, 2004) k ¼ k0 þ bσ c ð11þ 1 where k0 is the thermal conductivity of the rock at zero stress, σ1 is the axial stress, and b and c are ﬁt coefﬁcients, as listed in table 4. analysis of eq. (11) reveals that the coefﬁcient b plays a critical role in controlling the increasing gradient of the thermal conductivity in the initial loading stage (i.e., crack closure stage). the coefﬁcient c dominantly affects the increasing velocity of the thermal conductivity in the subsequent elastic deformation stage. based on experimental investigations on the thermal conductivity of some rocks subjected to uniaxial stresses using a steady-state apparatus developed by  (2004),  (2008) found that the parameters b and c depended on the magnitude of elastic modulus of the rocks, and subsequently established an elastic modulus dependent model to predict the thermal conductivity values under pressure. unfortunately, in the present study, the elastic moduli of the tested rocks have not been available. therefore, the model proposed by  (2008) cannot be used to ﬁt our test results. according to fig. 14, we found that the increasing gradients of the thermal conductivities in the initial loading stage were generally large for the rocks with a high porosity such as rock groups bs05 and bs15. hence, the coefﬁcient b is associated with the rock porosity n, i.e., b increases as n increases, as presented in fig. 15a. an exponential form expression can ﬁt the data reasonably, as follows: b ¼ 0:25 − 0:24 exp −nð þ ð12þ bs05 bs06 bs15 bs16 bs18-1 bs18-2 bs19-1 bs19-2 20 22 24 26

range. with increasing temperature from 25 °c to 150 °c, the thermal conductivity of the rocks shows a decaying trend and the values at 150 °c range from 5.7% to 8.7% lower than those at room temperature, revealing that the inﬂuence of temperature on the thermal conductivity of the tested rocks is limited. in addition, the thermal conductivity of the rocks increases with increasing compression stress in a nonlinear behavior, and the increase rate of the thermal conductivity increases with an increase of rock porosity. it is found that the effects of compression stress and water saturation on the magnitude of thermal conductivity of the rocks are basically comparable. based on the experimental data, the empirical models considering the inﬂuence of rock porosity have been established for predicting the temperature and compression stress dependent thermal conductivity characteristics of the rocks, and the predictions are found to be in good agreement with experimental results. this study thus emphasizes importance of porosity on thermal conductivity measurements even for low porosity crystalline rocks. when the pores and cracks in the rocks tend to close during compression, quartz content may determine the thermal conductivity, and there exists an increase of the thermal conductivity with increasing quartz content. this is because the closure of pores and cracks increases the contact opportunity of quartz grains, and hence improves the transportation capability of heat ﬂow in the rocks. while the test results provide insights into the thermal conductivity characteristics of beishan granitic rocks, one should be aware of the limitation of this study. because the thermal conductivity of granitic rocks is inﬂuenced by many factors. in order to better understand the thermal conductivity of granitic rocks related to rock characteristics such as rock fabric, grain shape, grain contact and grain size, comprehensive petrographic investigations are recommended in the future. in the meantime, studies should be carried out to understand how the interactions between mineral components affect the thermal conductivity. work is also being conducted to investigate the thermal conductivity of the rocks under coupled thermal-hydro-mechanical conditions. acknowledgments this work has been supported by the china atomic energy

thermal–hydraulic simulation maren brehme1 guido bloecher1 mauro cacace1 yustin kamah2 martin sauter3 gue nter zimmermann1 received: 24 november 2015 / accepted: 4 july 2016 / published online: 19 july 2016 ó springer-verlag berlin heidelberg 2016 abstract subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow of reservoirs in active tectonic regions is mainly controlled by permeability of fault zones. therefore, the characterization of fault zones is an important step toward performance assessment of a reservoir. the ﬂuid ﬂow is controlled also by pressure and temperature conditions. in this context, we simulated pressure and temperature ﬁelds to elaborate on the inﬂuence of permeability on subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow in the lahendong geothermal reservoir. thermal–hydraulic simulation is performed using a ﬁnite element approach. adjusting the permeability through 370 different cases, modeling results converged to the observed data within a misﬁt range of 0–7 %. the best ﬁtting models identiﬁed a deep-seated fault that has previously not been traced at the surface. simulated temperature distribution suggests a prominent convective heat ﬂow, driven by an upward migrating and sw–ne oriented ﬂuid ﬂow. this hydraulic gradient causes a pressure drop along the reservoir. highpressure patterns are used to constrain recharge areas, in addition to inﬁltration measurements. discharge ﬂow occurs from sw to ne migrating also upward toward the hot springs. in that frame, thermal–hydraulic simulations identiﬁed previously unresolved subsurface faults, which & maren brehme brehme@gfz-potsdam.de 1 helmholtz

energy demands. requires developing new geothermal sites and improving the performance of existing systems to satisfy continuously growing demand. the productivity of a geothermal ﬁeld mainly depends on subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow, which in active tectonic regions is controlled by permeability of fault zones (moeck 2014). in that frame, the primary focus is on locating and characterizing faulted areas in geothermal ﬁelds. this study employs numerical modeling to allocate and quantify permeability anisotropies and discontinuities, e.g., faults, in order to understand their inﬂuence on subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow in geothermal reservoirs. numerical models have been increasingly used to understand the setup and productivity of geothermal systems. a general overview of geothermal models has been given by o’ (2001). additionally, there are several sites exemplifying similar characteristics as in lahendong. the underground movement of hot and cold ﬂuids has been modeled for geothermal ﬁelds in new zealand ( 2014). the kakkonda geothermal site, e.g., consists of two reservoirs at various depths with different ﬂuid properties. there, results from ﬂuid ﬂow analysis show the importance of fractures for ﬂuid transport enhancing the recharge or discharge in the reservoir 123\\x0c1088 page 2 of 11 environ earth sci (2016) 75:1088 ( 1995). generally, faults acting as preferential ﬂuid path ways signiﬁcantly change the pressure and temperature ﬁeld in the reservoir ( 2013). models for the seferihisar–balc¸ova ﬁeld focus on the ﬂuid ﬂow inside of faults. results show an enhanced upward heat transport through ﬂuids from bottom of the geothermal system ( 2011). our test ground is the lahendong geothermal ﬁeld located in sulawesi, indonesia. the ﬁeld is owned and operated by p.t. pertamina geothermal energy and hosts a power plant with a production capacity of 80 mwe. there, geothermal exploration started in the early 1970s including geophysical and geohydrochemical approaches. it is a water-dominated magmatic structurally controlled system. faults generally act as across-fault ﬂuid barriers and alongfault ﬂuid conductors ( 2014). as a result, hot springs mainly appear on the top of vertically permeable faults at the surface. available numerous drilling and surface measurements allowed a detailed characterization of the geological and hydrogeological setting of the area (fig. 1;  2011, 2013, 2014, 2016;  2013). the model presented here is developed for investigating subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow and the permeability distribution including the fault zones in the lahendong geothermal ﬁeld. below, the geological structure of the ﬁeld is presented followed by an introduction to the modeling approach. detailed investigation of subsurface permeability distribution is a crucial step for site selection and smart drilling strategies. the numerical simulations presented will provide insight into understanding the subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow considering the hydraulic conductivity of faults. it ensures productive as well as sustainable operation of geothermal ﬁelds avoiding risks, such as drilling into non-fractured or cold zones, and targeting highly corroding waters. although the target area is lahendong, the general workﬂow is applicable for other geothermal sites consisting of similar constraints. reservoir characterization hydrogeology the overall driving force for the ﬂuid ﬂow is the sw–ne oriented natural hydraulic gradient in the lahendong geothermal system. the direction of ﬂuid ﬂow varies through the geothermal site due to horizontal partitioning of the reservoir by relatively less permeable fault zones ( 2014). the basic sections are located in the fig. 1 topographic map of the study area with geological features, water and rock sample locations, and model cross section 123\\x0cenviron earth sci (2016) 75:1088 page 3 of 11 1088 south, in the east, and beneath lake linau. beneath lake linau, the direction of ﬂuid ﬂow is slightly rotated to wsw–ene (fig. 1). also, types of ﬂuid change from one section to another, e.g., an acidic highly saline-type beneath lake linau and a neutral low saline-type south and east of lake linau (fig. 1). the impermeable structure across faults prevent the ﬂuids from diluting each other ( 2016). however, faults are rather permeable along the vertical axis, which allows recharge of the system through the faults. rainwater inﬁltrates at a fault in the sw, at mt. lengkoan, and creek water inﬁltrates into the normal faults at lake linau (fig. 2). the hydrothermal system discharges into lake linau and toward the ne, as driven by the hydraulic gradient ( 2014). the fracture network along the area is characterized by strike slip faults and normal faults. the sinistral faults strike n 40° and steeply dip toward the se. left step over on the strike slip faults forms an extension basin in the central study area. normal faults at the extension basin strike nw and dip 70°–80° beneath lake linau ( 2014). lithology lahendong area is mainly characterized by pre-, postand tondano formation of plioto pleistocene age ( 2010). the rocks are typically andesite, volcanic breccia, and tuff. those types have been sampled from borehole cores and used to determine porosity, permeability, and thermal conductivity. effective porosity and matrix permeability have been analyzed using a cylindrical-shaped specimen with a dimension of 5 cm x 5 cm 9 2.5 cm oriented parallel to the coring ( 2016). thermal conductivity has been measured on plain sections of dried cores. the experimental setup consists of a gas permeameter for determining matrix permeability ( 2011), of an helium pycnometry for effective porosity measurements (johnson- 1994) and of an optical scanner for thermal conductivity measurements ( 1999). these parameters have been measured and averaged for the three rock types ( 2016; table 1). andesite has an effective porosity of 3.7 %, a permeability of 2.1 9 10-14 m2, and a thermal conductivity of 1.8 w m-1 k-1 (dry) or 2.2 w m-1 k-1 (saturated). tuff has a porosity of 7.7 % but the lowest permeability of 2.0 9 10-15 m2 of 1.6 w m-1 k-1 (saturated). volcanic breccia is a permeable layer with an effective porosity of 10.5 %, a permeability of 2.3 9 10-14 m2, and a thermal conductivity of 1.6 w m-1 k-1 (dry) or 2.5 w m-1 k-1 (saturated). reservoir rocks reﬂect generally

2.3 9 10-14 2.0 9 10-15 element software feflow is used to model pressuredriven and thermally induced ﬂuid ﬂow including viscosity changes. governing equations for ﬂuid ﬂow and heat transport in saturated porous media are derived from conservation principles of linear momentum, mass, and energy (dhi-wasy 2009). details on the software and the parameterization can be found in diersch (2014). the model geometry is a 2d vertical sw–ne trending cross section extending 6 km in horizontal and 3 km in vertical direction. the direction of the proﬁle has been selected to cover all relevant processes in the lahendong geothermal ﬁeld: it cuts major faults and the production and injection wells, which are used for temperature and pressure calibration. furthermore, to the groundwater ﬂow direction, showing major ﬂuid ﬂow activities. the homogeneous and isotropic geological layers in the model are stratiﬁed nearly horizontally. faults in the middle of the model, striking perpendicular to the cross section, dip with 84° toward a cooling pluton beneath lake linau. details on structural and geological components of the modeled region have been presented in  (2014). is parallel it the numerical the mesh used for simulation in feflow consists of 45,264 nodes and 89,320 elements that are denser surrounding the faults because of expected gradients due to parameter contrasts. material properties of 123 elements are permeability, porosity, and thermal conductivity and set according to laboratory measurements (table 1). however, properties of the faults and lake linau are slightly adapted to speciﬁc conditions. the definitions for the modeled grids along the faults are as follows: porosity is 30 % and thermal conductivity is 1.8 w m-1 k-1. corresponding grids for lake linau are deﬁned by a porosity of 100 % and a thermal conductivity of 0.6 w m-1 k-1. the model simulates ﬂuid ﬂow and thermal transport in saturated media in steady state. initial values and boundary conditions fluid ﬂow boundary conditions in the model describe groundwater heads and recharge amounts (table 2; fig. 2). the hydraulic head at the sw model boundary is 837 m and 500 m at the ne boundary. the sw hydraulic head represents inﬁltration of surface water into a fault, striking perpendicular to the model. hydraulic head at the ne border is adapted to borehole measurements in that area ( 2014). inﬁltration into the fault zones at lake linau is described by ﬂuid ﬂux boundary conditions. the quantity is 3.0 9 10-4 m s-1 the sw and 1.3 9 10-6 m s-1 at the ne fault distributed over 40 m fault width. groundwater recharge is set to 412 mm a-1 at the ne top surface (table 2; fig. 2). fluid movement in for\\x0cthe model domain is constrained by no-ﬂow boundary at the bottom, recharge through the surrounding fault zones, and the low hydraulic heads in the ne model area. discharge of the system in the central study area is mainly toward lake linau and across the ne model boundary. initial hydraulic head for the whole model domain is 500 m. the heat is 116 °c km-1 at transport boundary conditions are time-invariant, ﬁxed temperatures, and heat ﬂux (table 2; fig. 2). thermal gradient the sw model boundary, and the temperature is constant 350 °c at the pluton. temperature of water inﬁltrating into faults and here mixing with shallow warm groundwater is 70 °c, while surface groundwater recharge is at 28 °c. temperature values are obtained from ﬁeld and bore log measurements ( 2014). heat ﬂux is set to 100 mw m-2 at the bottom model boundary (table 2; fig. 2). this value is ﬁxed based on the studies from  (1998), nagao and uyeda (1995), and  (1998). initial temperature for the model domain is set as 116 °c km-1, according to the local thermal gradient. permeability determination initial values for permeability are deﬁned based on laboratory measurements (table 1). after each simulation run, modeled and measured temperature and pressure values have been compared at indicated observation points. in case of poor matching (errors [10 %), permeability has been adjusted until satisfactory results have been achieved. beneath lake linau, simulation results showed locally strong discrepancies between modeled and measured pressure and temperature (errors [45 %). adjustment of permeability in geological inﬁltration rates into faults, or hydraulic heads did not lead to acceptable results. only the implementation of strong permeability anisotropy throughout whole depth, i.e., an additional fault, resulted in minimization of errors (0–7 %). implementation has been accomplished by mesh adaptation to ensure appropriate behavior around the fault. by this procedure, permeability anisotropies have been located and characterized in detail throughout the model. layers, in general, deﬁning a direction-dependent permeability improves the data ﬁt rather than using similar permeabilities in all directions. this is probably due to the fractures increasing the permeability mostly in vertical direction. porosity and thermal conductivity remained constant throughout simulation. variation in porosity is negligible because it would directly be reﬂected in permeability, while thermal conductivity differences would only affect conductive heat transport, which is not dominant in the lahendong area ( 1998;  2014). 123 100c measurementa 500borelog ofmodel

best ﬁt to the measured data changing the absolute and relative permeability in geological elements. relative permeability refers to different permeabilities in horizontal and vertical direction. as a main result, a blind fault has been recognized beneath lake linau, which has not been known from former studies. simulated pressure and temperature are measured at ﬁve selected observation points, which represent boreholes with available bore logs for pressure and temperature. details on data are given in fig. 6. the model with best data ﬁt, out of 370 different models, is considered to generate the ﬁnal model developed for lahendong. permeability distribution and identiﬁcation of a blind fault distribution of permeability patterns in the reservoir has been conceived comparing temperature and pressure data in several wells. especially beneath lake linau, closely located wells show high variations in temperature and pressure. a drop of 100 °c and 18 bar along 300 m distance has been observed between well lhd 24 and lhd 28. models ﬁrst showed high discrepancies between modeled and measured values in this area. however, after implementing another high anisotropic permeable structure between the observation points, models resulted in satisfactory results. the structure has ten times higher vertical environ earth sci (2016) 75:1088 permeability than horizontal permeability. this structure is assumed to be another fault zone located between two known faults with vertical dip and nw strike. this fault shows no trace at surface, because it is covered by lake linau. generally, modeled permeability distribution in the lahendong reservoir is direction-dependent and overprints the lithology. modeled permeability is generally higher than measured ones in the order of up to four magnitudes. this is due to fracture patterns, which are not detectable at core-sample scale. permeability patterns directly affect subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow and temperature and pressure distribution. permeability in the faulted zones and surroundings is lowest in the study area. especially the middle and ne fault, the shallow area beneath sw lake linau and the deep ne section of the ne fault show low permeabilities between 10-13 and 10-14 m2 (fig. 3). the area between the middle and ne fault, the deep section ne of the sw fault, the sw fault itself and the whole model area toward the sw and ne boundary show higher permeabilities of 10-10 and 10-12 m2 (fig. 3). permeability varies not only within the modeled area, but also in vertical and horizontal direction. in faults and the deep reservoir section in the ne, permeability is by a factor of 10 higher in the vertical direction than in the horizontal direction (fig. 3). in the areas between faults, permeability is in some parts by a factor of 10–100 lower in the vertical direction. in the rest of the model, vertical and horizontal permeability do not differ (fig. 3). fig. 3 final adapted permeability and anisotropy

elevations in the sw. some wells existing in this region are of artesian-type. overpressure releases through high permeable zones beneath lake linau and discharges toward surface. the pressure drop is up to 20 bars across the faults (fig. 4). temperature distribution temperature distribution along the lahendong geothermal reservoir suggests that convective heat transport is the dominating process in the reservoir rocks. isotherms generally follow the sw–ne oriented ﬂow pattern, the rise and the inﬁltration of ﬂuids. upwelling of isotherms between the faults veriﬁes water rise toward lake linau. inﬁltration of cold water causes down welling of isotherms particularly on the northeast section of the model. temperature is locally increased at the bottom of the model surrounding the pluton (fig. 4). subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow the absolute and horizontal/vertical permeability distribution controls local ﬂuid ﬂow in the lahendong reservoir. the general ﬂuid ﬂow, driven by the natural pressure gradient, is oriented from sw to ne. vertical inﬁltration occurs at faults at lake linau and at the sw boundary. discharge is across the ne model boundary (fig. 5). the more detailed ﬂow patterns can be observed with streamlines, which show a ﬂuid ﬂow along highly permeable areas. calculated streamlines describe particle ﬂow within the model domain. a forward calculation shows how inﬁltrating water at the sw model boundary distributes through the reservoir. the backward calculation shows the source of ﬂuid particles arriving at the ne model boundary (fig. 5). patterns show that hot groundwater ﬂows toward the faults beneath lake linau, where the ﬂuid ﬂow is disturbed by a rise in temperature and vertically high permeable layers. this causes a rise of groundwater in this model area (red forward streamlines in fig. 5). at the same time, cold water inﬁltrates into high permeable areas and distributes over the ne model domain (blue backward streamlines in fig. 5). it is clearly seen that the composition of the ne reservoir domain is dominated by coldwater inﬁltration into faults, while the production areas are characterized by hot water ﬂow (fig. 5). discussion investigation of subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow in geothermal reservoirs is crucial for sustainable exploitation avoiding drilling into less productive areas. subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow might be locally inﬂuenced by fault zones or physical 123\\x0c1088 page 8 of 11 environ earth sci (2016) 75:1088 fig. 5 model domain with calculated streamlines, in red: forward streamlines follow hydraulic gradient from sw model boundary towards ne, in blue: backward streamlines representing inﬁltrating cold water ﬂowing towards ne model boundary properties of water (i.e. viscosity). the inﬂuence of these parameters on the ﬂuid ﬂow has been investigated in lahendong geothermal reservoir using hydraulic–thermal simulations. simulation results show the detailed permeability distribution in the reservoir including location of an additional fault zone. matching of measured and simulated temperature and pressure has been used as a tool for resolving the permeability distribution. temperature and pressure have been iteratively determined at several observation points (fig. 2). generally, modeled values are in good agreement with observed ones (fig. 6). nevertheless, some observation points give slightly different values for both pressure and temperature (lhd 4 and lhd 7) or only temperature (lhd 24). this is probably due to the complicated ﬂow processes or strong small-scale structural variation in fractured and faulted areas. furthermore, density variations, which could have not been included into simulation due to high temperatures, could cause variation of ﬂuid pressure. however, the average deviation of simulated pressure and temperature is 1 %. implemented model parameters are porosity, permeability, and heat conductivity. from those parameters, only permeability has been tested in a speciﬁc range during simulation. the inﬂuence of porosity and heat conductivity on ﬂuid ﬂow is negligible due to dominating convective heat ﬂow ( 1998). values implemented in the model are based on measured permeabilities, which represent matrix permeability of rocks. the measured matrix permeability, representing permeability in horizontal direction, is 1.5 9 10-14 m2 on 123 average, which remains within typical permeability range for fractured igneous rocks (schoen 2004). permeability for volcanic breccias ranges typically between 3 9 10-15 and 5 9 10-12 m2 and tuff permeabilities range between 7 9 10-17 and 7 9 10-12 m2 (klavetter and peters 1987). in the wairakei geothermal ﬁeld, simulating the impermeable layers resulted in permeabilities of 10-18 and 10-14 m2, in horizontal and vertical axis, respectively (mercer and faust 1979). however, permeability in reservoir rocks might be locally increased due to fracture formation. it might also be decreased due to alteration and sealing in faults. in lahendong, modeled permeability can be up to four magnitudes higher than measured ones in faulted areas. this is caused by fractures, which are not detectable in core scale. moreover, in fault cores, it is by a factor of 10 higher in vertical direction than in horizontal direction. however, in areas between faults (fault gauge), permeability is in some parts by a factor of 10–100 lower in the vertical direction. adaptation of permeability ensures a ﬁt to measured temperature and pressure data. permeability in fractured areas is the main factor inﬂuencing subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow and temperature distribution in the lahendong reservoir area. subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow is driven by local hydraulic heads, which show high variations at different sections of the study area. consequently, convective heat distribution leads to high temperature variation along the reservoir. these phenomena are observed in lahendong as well as comparable ﬁelds. in new mexico, water level drops of 30–100 m are observed across (haneberg 1995). high several fault zones\\x0c123 environ earth sci (2016) 75:1088 page 9 of 11 1088 7 24 4 28 5 well name lhd 4 lhd 5 lhd 7 lhd 24 lhd 28

temperature drops and upwelling of isotherms indicate that fault zones control the ﬂuid ﬂow in the lake long and valentine ﬁelds, usa (hooper 1991). the analysis of ﬂuid pressure differences at the alpine fault, new zealand, allowed to characterize the change in permeability between hanging and footwall blocks ( 2012). in summary, high pressure or temperature gradients are indicators for ﬂuid barriers between observation points. in other words, reservoir sections of different properties are separated by horizontally less permeable faults. in lahendong, most signiﬁcant ﬂuid barriers are faults to the sw and to the ne of lake linau. across these barriers, the pressure drops up to 20 bars. a similar pattern has been measured in bore logs beneath lake linau, where no surface trace of a fault had been observed in former studies. however, only by implementing another fault, modeled and measured values could have been adapted. the recently identiﬁed fault zone beneath lake linau remains under lake water and therefore is only traceable by this kind of reservoir modeling. additionally to fault identiﬁcation, the internal structure of known fault zones has been understood in detail. the ne fault, i.e., shows a displacement at 2 km depth. the detailed trend has been understood by permeability adaptation in this area. due to low permeability in horizontal direction in the faults, ﬂuids propagate mostly vertically toward the hot springs at surface. it also allows surface water to inﬁltrate into the reservoir in case the pressure within the fault zone is low enough (fig. 5). this vertical ﬂuid movement eventually controls the temperature distribution in the reservoir. upward migration of deep hot water increases the temperature, while inﬁltration of cold surface water causes local drop of temperature. in summary, the most important factors inﬂuencing the reliability of numerical reservoir models are absolute and different horizontal and vertical permeability. however, a permeability adaptation has been done for each geological layer; the vertical permeability anomalies are overprinting those layers and are constraining the regional groundwater ﬂow. those permeabilities of fractures directly inﬂuence the productivity of the reservoir ( 2013). therefore, their permeability characteristics should be investigated in detail. in a previous study, a numerical model for the lahendong site has been set up in tough2 and aimed at forecasting the reservoir behavior during exploitation until the year 2036. with a production of 60 mwe, it predicts a pressure drop of 10 bars. however, the forecast results are uncertain due to lack of measured pressure draw down data (yani 2006). accordingly, the next steps of the presented study should include a realistic production and injection scenario in order reservoir exploitation. furthermore, chemical characteristics could be considered to achieve reliable production setups, because hydrochemical processes play an important role in the lahendong reservoir ( 2016). presented models from this study provide important information on ﬂuid ﬂow in the water-dominated lahendong reservoir. however, additional the two-phase ﬂow models of to support sustainable\\x0c1088 page 10 of 11 environ earth sci (2016) 75:1088 lahendong area are in progress to understand the inﬂuence of steam driven ﬂuid ﬂow in this high-temperature system. conclusion the primary focus of this study is to understand the inﬂuence of fault zones and permeability patterns on subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow in geothermal reservoirs. the ﬂuid ﬂow mainly depends on rock and fault zone permeability. these processes have been considered in numerical models, which simulate local temperature and pressure conditions. the initial reservoir conditions, which refers to the case before production starts. models are developed based on the conceptual models of the study area, which explain reservoir geometry, geological structures, temperature, and hydraulic conditions. temperature and pressure well-logs have been used for model calibration. the numerical models represent vertical and horizontal ﬂuid ﬂow is mainly controlled by fault permeability. this characteristic is used to simulate different reservoir sections, and vertical ﬂuid rise toward the surface. by stepwise adaptation of permeability ﬁelds, based on observed temperature and pressure gradients, an additional blind fault zone can be identiﬁed beneath lake linau. temperature and pressure signiﬁcantly drop across that ﬂuid barrier. this behavior has been observed in comparable ﬁelds in the usa as well. the overall shape of ﬂuid ﬂow direction trends in a sw–ne direction. main recharge occurs by inﬁltration of surface water into the faults, especially in the southwest and near to lake linau. discharge is enhanced in highly fractured areas toward lake linau. vertical permeability of faults allows ﬂuids rising toward the hot springs at surface. results show that permeability has to be considered for simulation of a geothermal system. the geothermal system is mainly controlled by ﬂuid ﬂow in fractures/faults depending on temperature and pressure conditions. the locally modiﬁed ﬂuid ﬂow can considerably inﬂuence the productivity of a geothermal ﬁeld. results also guide reservoir management in case of a potential for ﬁeld extension, as performed in lahendong. acknowledgments the authors acknowledge the continuous support within the team of the international center for geothermal research under the direction of e. huenges. thanks to

an effective renewable energy source due to severe environmental impacts created by conventional fossil usage on global climatic change. however, its wide application has been limited due to the lack of knowledge, particularly of the geothermal conditions of reservoir rocks at elevated temperatures and pressures. such high temperatures and pressures possibly alter the mechanical properties of reservoir rocks due to the associated micro-structural and mineralogical alterations of the rock mass, which are an important attribute for wellbore stability and stimulation of geothermal reservoirs for safe and effective geothermal energy extraction. this study therefore investigates the stress-strain behaviour under in-situ stress and temperature conditions by conducting a series of high-pressure, high-temperature tri-axial experiments on australian strathbogie granite under four different conﬁning pressures (10, 30, 60, 90 mpa) and four different temperatures (rt, 100, 200, 300 ◦c). the effect of temperature on the mechanical behaviour of rock specimens was studied under tri-axial conditions and the corresponding fracture propagation behaviour was observed using an advanced acoustic emission (ae) system. the corresponding micro-structure alteration in granite was observed using sem analysis. according to the ﬁndings, increasing temperature leads to an initial increment in reservoir rock strength and shear parameters followed by reduction, and the trend is aligned with the crack formation pattern of the rock mass. this was further conﬁrmed by the sem analysis, according to which the rock micro-structure is subject to only minor changes at relatively low temperatures and higher temperatures cause micro-cracks to develop along the rock mass grain boundaries. furthermore, the conventional mohr-coulomb criteria failed to model the stress-strain response of rock under geothermal reservoir conditions, and was therefore modiﬁed for the corresponding in-situ conditions. © 2016 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved. 1. introduction geothermal heat has been identiﬁed as a renewable and reliable energy source, given the severe environmental impacts created by

have adequate temperatures to serve as a geothermal reservoirs (, 2013). such explorations involve ﬁnding vast blocks of “hot rocks” with fracture systems. such rocks can be used to generate electricity. in this process, water is ﬁrst injected and circulated through the fractures in the geothermal reservoirs and eventually pumped back to the surface as steam. however, the exploration of geothermal resources has become a challenge to engineers and geologists, due to the high temperature and stress environments in geothermal reservoirs. for this reason, laboratory experiments conducted under high pressure and temperature conditions (geothermal conditions) can assist in providing\\x0cw.g.p.  / geothermics 65 (2017) 44–59 45 basic predictions. a large number of laboratory experiments has therefore been conducted since 1970 to investigate the inﬂuence of high pressure and temperature on rock in relation to geothermal heat extraction (, 2016), deep geological disposal of nuclear waste (paquet and franc¸ ois, 1980), deep mining (wawersik and hannum, 1980) and geological co2 storage (, 2014). the mechanical behaviour of reservoir rocks is signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by elevated temperatures, because they cause the micro-structure of the rock mass to be altered through thermal expansion, the development of new micro-cracks, extending and/or widening the existing micro cracks and various mineralogical alterations. rock strength-deformation criteria change with temperature, and some rock mechanical properties, such as compressive strength, tensile strength, elastic modulus, cohesive strength and friction angle, decrease with increasing temperature (heuze, 1983; , 2008). however, such alterations are also affected by the conﬁnement applying on the rock mass, and conﬁning pressure causes the suppression of thermal cracks and the extension/widening of existing micro-cracks. this results in further alteration of the rock mass mechanical properties, resulting in changing failure modes (mogi, 1966). studies have identiﬁed the transition of rock failure mode from brittle to ductile with increasing conﬁnement. however, this transition is diverse due to the different mineralogical compositions and grain boundaries in different rocks (, 2001; wong, 1982). although many studies have been conducted to investigate the temperature-dependent mechanical behaviour of reservoir rocks, most experiments have been conducted in unconﬁned environments (, 2015; , 2014). pre-heating the specimens to the corresponding temperature ranges and testing at room temperatures has been frequently done (bauer and johnson, 1979; , 2008), but the method is not reliable, as geothermal reservoirs experience continuous thermal stresses. such limitations have occurred mainly due to the limited number of appropriate test facilities available to simulate the stress and temperature conditions of actual geothermal reservoirs. although some studies have analytically and numerically evaluated the mechanical properties of rocks under high temperatures and pressures (chester and higgs, 1992; , 2013; , 2016), to date none has captured the stress-strain behaviour and failure criteria of rocks over a wide range of conﬁning pressures and temperatures, particularly for australian granite. however, the thermo-elastic response and appropriate failure criteria are essential inputs for many engineering applications under high pressures and temperatures, including geothermal extraction applications. this study therefore intends to ﬁll this gap, and it is hoped it will make an important contribution to many deep underground applications. 2. methodology 2.1. tested material granite is an abundant crystalline rock in the earth with medium to coarse grains which was formed as a result of the slow cooling of magma. granite therefore has abundant radioactive elements (k, th, and u). such elements bring elevated geothermal gradients to deep granite reservoirs, which therefore have ideal conditions as geothermal reservoirs. the mineralogical composition of granite mainly consists of quartz, feldspar, plagioclase and biotite, and small amounts of muscovite, amphibole, hornblende and opaque (, 2008). for the present study, samples were collected from the strathbogie batholith, which is a composite granitoid intrusion body spreading over more than 1500 km2 in 150 km north-east from melbourne (fig. 1). strathbogie granite is a high-level, discordant fig. 1. sampling location of strathbogie batholith in central victoria. table 1 physical, mechanical and

petrographic properties of the tested strathbogie granite. in addition, an xrd analysis was conducted to determine the mineralogical composition of the selected granite and the result is shown in table 2. as the table shows, quartz is the predominant mineral in the selected granite (50%), followed by 16% of sodic and intermediate biotite and 15% of plagioclase. the mineralogical composition of this particular granitic composition is representative of the composition of the majority of the earth’s granites (best, 1995). all the physical properties in tables 1 and 2\\x0c46 w.g.p.  /

(a) dilatancy and failure by strain softening under relatively low conﬁning pressures and (b) failure by strain hardening under elevated conﬁning pressures, and a transitional regime may be observed at intermediate pressures. these transitional failure modes have been referred to as “quasi-brittle”, and complex localized features such as conjugate shear bands can be observed under such conditions (, 2001; , 2004). by visual inspection of the post-failure samples, important information about the alteration of the granite failure mechanism with conﬁning pressures and temperatures can be identiﬁed. postfailure images (fig. 5) were therefore collected after each test. according to the post-failure images, specimens that failed at 10–60 mpa conﬁning pressures mainly failed by shear localization along an inclined macroscopic shear band with a single shear zone across each sample. however, samples tested at higher conﬁnements of 90 mpa and 120 mpa (at 100 ◦c) exhibited strain hardening characteristics after achieving the peak stress, and several conjugate shear bands could be observed on the cylindrical sample surface, instead of the single shear band observed earlier. this characteristic was signiﬁcant at 120 mpa conﬁning pressure. however, it should be noted that only one test was conducted at 120 mpa conﬁnement, because at such high conﬁning pressures the corresponding failure load of granite exceeds the bottom pedestal’s load-bearing capacity. further, a progressive reduction was observed in the failure plane angle with respect to the minor principal stress direction with increasing conﬁning pressure, which implies a reduction in friction angle, possibly due to the greater quasi-brittle behaviour that was shown by granite samples at higher conﬁning pressures (, 2001). 3.2. effect of temperature and conﬁning pressure on mechanical properties of strathbogie granite fig. 6 illustrates the inﬂuence of temperature on the deviatoric stress of the tested granite under each conﬁnement. as the ﬁgure shows, the inﬂuence of conﬁnement is more signiﬁcant than that of temperature in the temperature range considered here. wong and brace (1979) conﬁrm that at lower conﬁning pressures considerable thermal cracking occurs at relatively low temperatures. if thermal cracking is responsible for the reduction in failure strength, a sharp reduction in deviatoric stress with increasing temperature (with suppression of thermal cracks) should be exhibited under unconﬁned pressure condition. however, based on the experimental results, under unconﬁned conditions, up to 100 ◦c, 17.6% of increment in deviatoric stress is followed by 2.5% and 10.5% reductions at 200 ◦c and 300 ◦c, respectively. however, when conﬁnement was applied, strength reduction was initiated after higher temperature of 200 ◦c, mainly due to the inhibition of a thermal cracks by induced compressive force. thermal cracking is therefore an important strength property alteration mechanism in reservoir rocks under certain conﬁning pressure conditions. a clear inﬂuence of temperature on deviatoric stress at any depth or conﬁnement can be observed, and increasing the temperature from room temperature to 200 ◦c causes an increment in deviatoric stress, and further increasing of temperature to 300 ◦c causes a slight reduction in it. this is because the thermal expansion which occurs with increasing temperature causes the reduction of fig. 3. (a) high-pressure, high-temperature tri-axial machine (b) inside view of the cell. ing calibration. however, it should be noted that, compared to the large axial load, this resistance is negligible which is only 0.19% of maximum measurement. during the load application, the axial strain was measured using linear variable differential transducers (lvdts) attached to the ram of the load cell (fig. 3(a)). an acoustic emission (ae) system was also employed in the testing of samples to record the data related to the fracturing process. the ae system adopted was a peripheral component interconnection (pci) system with a nominal resolution frequency of 500 khz. during the experiments, two sensors were attached to either side of the loading shaft and with the external ampliﬁers, which generated low frequency acoustic waves with the fracturing of the sample. in addition, possible micro-structural and mineralogical changes that occurred during thermal and conﬁnement effects were checked using sem analyses. 3. results and discussion 3.1. the overall stress-strain response the inﬂuence of temperature on the stress-strain behaviour of the tested granite was considered ﬁrst

deviatoric stress and axial strain curves for the samples tested at 10, 30, 60 and 90 mpa conﬁning pressures at various temperatures (20, 100, 200, 300 ◦c). in relation to the stress-strain curves of

grain boundaries between mineral grains with different thermoelastic moduli and thermal conductivities, resulting in reduced rock strength (kranz, 1983; homand-etienne and houpert, 1989). according to

reductions of strength characteristics were relatively small up to 500 ◦c and beyond that an accelerated downward trend was identiﬁed. furthermore, wider localized zones were observed at high temperatures in the post-failure images. however, these studies were conducted at wider temperature ranges (up to 700 ◦c and 900 ◦c, respectively) and the researchers therefore did not pay close attention to reservoir rock behaviour under relatively low geothermal temperature ranges (<300 ◦c). this was the focus of the present study, according to which there is an initial strengthening and stiffening in granite with increasing temperature at low temperatures (up to 200 ◦c), and increasing the temperature beyond a certain value causes a gradual reduction in failure stress with increasing temperature. elastic modulus is an important mechanical property of any reservoir rock, and describes the brittle characteristics of the rock mass. it is therefore often used to evaluate many in-situ stress applications, including wellbore stability, fracturing possibility and tectonic stress distribution (heard and page, 1982). the temperature-dependent brittle properties (elastic modulus) of the tested granite were then evaluated. the elastic region of each stress-strain curve was used to calculate the temperature and pressure-dependent young’s moduli (e) and the results are shown in fig. 7. the axial strain was measured using lvdts attached to the loading ram with a linearity ±0.1% f.s (full scale) (±0.0075 mm) and inﬁnite resoluerror of tion (no hysteresis). an increment of the modulus of strathbogie granite with increasing temperature up to 200 ◦c can be observed, and further increase of temperature (to 300 ◦c) causes the elastic modulus to be slightly reduced for any conﬁnement. this trend is\\x0ca ‘brittle’ or general increment in elastic modulus with increasing conﬁnement can be observed until 90 mpa, and a further increase of conﬁnement (to 120 mpa) reduces the young’s modulus considerably. with increasing conﬁning stress additional plastic deformation occurs, exhibiting strain-hardening characteristics in granite under high conﬁnements. however, within the range of the experiments conducted (10 mpa–120 mpa) it cannot be deﬁnitively identiﬁed as a ’ductile’ regime. however, the strain-hardening behaviour observed at 120 mpa indicates transitional characteristics and this can be identiﬁed as ‘quasi-brittle’ behaviour (, 2001). the initial young’s modulus reduction with increasing conﬁnement was observed by heard and page (1982), who conducted tests up to 55 mpa conﬁning pressure. however, the latter behaviour was not observed by these researchers. interestingly, according to the research literature, at low temperatures (<200 ◦c) some granite types are more temperature-sensitive, while in contrast, some granites are more temperature-sensitive at high temperatures. the initial strength enhancement is more signiﬁcant for coarse-grained granites and granodiorite than for ﬁne-grained granites. for example, according to heard and page (1982), stripa granite is more sensitive to temperature at relatively low temperatures (<200 ◦c), and westerly granite is more sensitive to temperature at high temperatures (>200 ◦c). such contradictory behaviours may occur in granite due to the different grain size distributions, grain orientations, mineralogical compositions and heterogeneity of different granite types. this indicates the importance of studying the mineralogical composition and microstructural inﬂuence of granites on such on temperature-dependent strength variations. 3.3. effect of temperature on shear strength parameters of strathbogie granite fig. 8 illustrates the variation of deviatoric stress of the tested granite with conﬁning pressure for each temperature. the ﬁgure shows that increasing conﬁnement causes the granite’s deviatoric stress to increase non-linearly and gradually come to a steady state. this is consistent with similar previous studies, which have clearly shown the enhancement of rock strength with increasing conﬁnement, and the increasing rate is reduced with increasing conﬁning pressure (barton, 2013; , 2011). this is because at low conﬁning pressures there is a high dilation potential. therefore, the ability to open rock micro-cracks is high, resulting in higher friction angles. however, this dilation potential and the corresponding tendency for micro-cracks to open are suppressed with increasing conﬁnement, resulting in lower friction angles at higher conﬁning pressures. therefore, the failure mechanism of the rocks shifts from brittle to ductile with increasing conﬁnement, changing the shape of the mohr-coulomb failure envelope, and according to barton (1976), at critical conﬁning pressure the mohr-coulomb failure envelope reaches a zero gradient. this has also been shown by hoek (1983). the present study has clearly identiﬁed this rock behaviour in the mohr-coulomb failure envelopes developed for each temperature condition (refer to fig. 9). according to fig. 9, the traditional linear mohr-coulomb criteria are applicable only in the brittle region of the failure envelope, and at higher conﬁnew.g.p.  / geothermics 65 (2017) 44–59 consistent with the temperature-dependent strength behaviour of the granite described above. the reason for the initial elastic module increment may be that the specimen becomes more brittle at the initial temperature ranges due to thermally-induced volumetric expansion and the associated pore volume reduction. the later slight reduction of young’s modulus with increasing temperature exhibits an enhancement in ductile behaviour (quasi-brittle characteristics) with further increase of temperature. this is possibly due to the increased crack density caused by the induced thermal crack development and the related weakening of the granite. 600 500 400 300 200 100 0 50 σ1-σ3(mpa) 0 100 temperature (ºc) 200

variation in (a) friction angle and (b) cohesion with different temperatures (considering linear region of the mohr coulomb failure envelope). the latter positive effect of temperature on cohesion, according to wong and brace (1979), increasing the temperature to an extreme value may cause weakening of the grain boundaries, dependent on the anisotropy of the rock matrix (due to potentially existing distinct mineral compounds in granite those may contain different thermo-elastic moduli and this may causes to generate different internal stresses with heating). according to wong and brace (1979), increasing the temperature causes the induction of thermal cracks in the rock mass due to the associated generation of internal stresses (eq. (2)): (2) e(cid:4)˛(cid:4)t = \\u2434 where, e, \\x01␣, \\x01t is the matrix young’s modulus, difference of thermal expansion coefﬁcient of distinct mineral and temperature difference, respectively. when the internal stress (given by eq. (2)) exceeds the crack closure pressure with increasing temperature, thermal cracks form and further increase of temperature provides the surface energy required for the propagation of the initiated crack (, 2007). this results in alteration of the grain-tograin contacts in the rock matrix, which leads to reduced cohesion at higher temperatures. in the case of the variation of friction angle with increasing temperature, the granite friction angle appears to remain steady up to around 100 ◦c (52◦) and then slightly increases with increasing temperature (54◦ at 200 and 300 ◦ c, respectively). the friction between grain-to-grain contacts may be altered by the thermally-induced micro-structural modiﬁcations. however, this effect on grain contact is expected to be smaller at relatively low temperatures, resulting in relatively steady friction angle with increasing temperature at lower temperatures. however, a slight ments non-linearity must be taken into account. in addition to the conﬁnement, according to this study, increasing temperature also alters the failure envelope of granite. an initial increment in deviatoric stress with increasing temperature can be observed up to 200 ◦c and further increase of temperature (to 300 ◦c) causes it to be slightly reduced. the temperature-dependent shear parameters of granite were investigated next, and the shear parameters can be obtained from the mohr-coulomb failure envelope. as suggested by  (2011), the mohr-coulomb parameters (cohesion and friction angle) were calculated using eq. (1), taking into account the linear region of the obtained mohr-coulomb failure envelope (considering only smaller conﬁning stresses, up to 30 mpa) for each temperature condition to obtain the temperature-dependent shear strength parameters (fig. 10).

(continued) enhancement in friction angle with increasing temperature can be seen, probably due to the increased resistance of mineral particles to external deformation as a result of the thermally-induced energy in the mineral particles. however, compared with cohesion, the temperature dependency on friction angle is relatively insigniﬁcant within the temperature region considered here. initial enhancement in shear parameters in sandstone with increasing temperature has been observed by  (2015) at relatively low temperature regions, and these researchers observed reduction in friction angle from 33.02◦ to 31.93◦ and an increment a in cohesion from 61.47 mpa to 66.44 mpa with increasing temperature from 25 ◦c to 100 ◦c. further, bauer and johnson (1979) observed around 10% reduction in cohesion and 40% reduction in friction angle in westerly granite with increasing temperature from room temperature to 300 ◦c, and  (1979) observed 7% reduction in cohesion and a 38% reduction in friction angle a with increasing temperature from room temperature to 400 ◦c and 300 ◦c, respectively. however, the variation of shear strength parameters with increasing temperature at relatively low temperatures (<300 ◦c) was not considered in the above studies. the observed initial shear strengthening may be due to the inhibition of micro-crack propagation by the plasticity mechanism which occurs at crack tips (duclos and paquet (1991)) at low temperatures. with further increment of temperature, the reduction of shear strength parameters can be expected, due to the thermal weakening of the rock micro-structure. furthermore, according to the sem studies conducted by  (2007), large local plastic deformations and extremely rough cleavage fractures occur at relatively low temperatures. moreover, due to the volume expansion, the distance between the interfaces of the individual minerals decreases with the enhancement of their mutual attraction, and the strength of the bonds increases (dmitriev, 1972). both of these phenomena can be considered to explain the stress strengthening of granite under relatively low temperatures when subjected to conﬁning pressures. 3.4. analysis of fracturing behaviour using ae technology acoustic emission (ae) detection technology is a powerful nondestructive tool to study crack propagation processes in brittle materials, including the stages of crack initiation, growth and crack damage (lockner, 1993). when a brittle material is under stress, strain energy is released during the development of new cracks or the widening of existing cracks. this energy is released in the form of elastic stress waves from the crack tips, and can be captured and ampliﬁed by an ae system. ae detection technology has therefore been widely used in a number of previous studies to understand the crack development mechanism in brittle materials (chang and lee, 2004; , 2000; , 2005). by incorporating the crack propagation pattern into the stressstrain relationship of the cracking material, the crack development process can be divided into several stages. hoek and bieniawski (1965) divided crack formation into ﬁve main stages: crack closure, crack initiation, secondary cracking, crack coalescence and crack damage. later,  (2008) and  (2015) incorporated stress-strain curves into cumulative ae counts/energy and strain plots. in the crack propagation process, with the gradual increment of loading on brittle materials, most pre-existing cracks are ﬁrst closed, releasing an insigniﬁcant number of ae counts. this initial crack closure period is followed by the stable crack propagation period, which can be identiﬁed by the release of gradual ae energy increments. further increment of loading causes an exponential increase in ae energy, indicating an unstable crack propagation period with failure approaching. the crack closure threshold ((cid:2)cc) is deﬁned as the stress threshold at which the initial ae counts are identiﬁed. anan initial increment in cumulative ae\\x0c54 w.g.p.  / geothermics 65 (2017) 44–59 counts can be seen at the crack initiation ((cid:2)ci) threshold, and the cumulative ae counts starts exponential growth at the crack damage ((cid:2)cd) threshold. the region between the crack closure threshold and the crack initiation threshold is generally deﬁned as the stable crack closure region, where linear elastic deformation occurs. the region between the crack initiation threshold and the crack damage threshold is deﬁned as the stable crack propagation region, and the region between the crack damage threshold and sample failure is identiﬁed as the unstable crack propagation region. the application of compressive loading fails rocks through either shear localization (brittle regime) or cataclastic ﬂow, and the surrounding conditions, such as temperatures and pressures, may cause a homogenous plastic ﬂow. according to existing studies, axial intra-granular cracking and shear rupturing of cemented grain contacts can be observed before failure in brittle regimes, and grain crushing and pore collapse can be identiﬁed before failure in cataclastic ﬂow regimes (, 1996). according to  (1997), the development of local stress concentrations leads to the initiation of many intra-granular micro-cracks in the rock mass, and the crack density increases with increasing deviatoric stress and tends to merge on reaching the peak stress, resulting in strain softening and shear localization. these damage processes are clearly identiﬁed by the intense ae activities in the ﬁeld (chang and lee, 2004). ae technology was therefore used to investigate the progressive fracturing behaviour in strathbogie granite under tri-axial conditions. fig. 11 illustrates the cumulative ae events with axial stress at various pressures and temperatures for the tested specimens. the corresponding variations of deviatoric stress against strain are also included in the same plots to identify the stress thresholds for crack closure, crack initiation and crack damage (table 4). the very high ae counts in strathbogie granite at dilatancy in the pre-failure stage are due to the fact that ae waves generate when the local shear stress concentration at a grain contact is sufﬁciently high to rupture the grain boundaries, and frictional slips and grain rotations may occur once the grain contacts have lost their cohesion. in the present study, crack threshold ratios were deﬁned to identify the temperature and pressure-dependent crack propagation in the tested granite as follows, and fig. 12 shows the crack propagation stress threshold ratios of granite specimens tested at various conﬁning pressures and temperatures. crack closure stress threshold = deviatoric stress at crack closure stress deviatoric stress at failure ((cid:2)cc) crack initiation stress threshold = deviatoric stress at crack initiation stress deviatoric stress at failure ((cid:2)ci) crack damage stress threshold = deviatoric stress at crack damage stress ((cid:2)cd) deviatoric stress at failure according to the results, the beginning of crack damage occurs at earlier stages of deviatoric loading for higher conﬁning pressures. however, the crack damage stress increases with increasing conﬁnement due to the inﬂuence of conﬁning pressure on thermal crack development and the suppression of the extension/widening of existing micro-cracks. according to fig. 12, in the temperature range considered here, three tendencies can be identiﬁed with increasing conﬁning pressure: increase of the elastic deformation region, decrease of the stable crack propagation region, and increase of the unstable crack propagation region. the crack initiation stress threshold also progressively increases with increasing conﬁning pressure, which can be attributed to the fact that the brittle behaviour of rock specimens at lower conﬁning pressures changes to quasi-brittle behaviour with increasing conﬁning pressure. this is because the suppression of micro-crack development is less at low conﬁning pressures, and therefore sudden failures mostly occur, and the beginning of crack initiation occurs at earlier stages of deviatoric loading at high conﬁning pressures due to the higher normal stress acting on micro-cracks, resulting in limited progression of cracking before failure. in relation to the temperature effect, increasing the temperature causes an initial increment in the crack propagation stress threshold, followed by a slight reduction for all the temperature conditions considered. for example, at 30 mpa conﬁnement, the crack damage stress threshold ratios increased by around 6.8%, 10.5% with increasing temperature from room temperature to 100 and 200 ◦c, respectively, and reduced by around 4.0% when the temperature increased to 300 ◦c. this implies that at low temperatures a suppressed micro-crack development mechanism is dominant, and increasing the temperature causes crack damage to occur at earlier loading stages. interestingly, at 60 mpa conﬁnement the crack damage stress threshold ratio increased by around 4.9%, 5.4%, 2.6% with increasing temperature from room to 100, 200 and 300 ◦c, respectively. this exhibits the cumulative effect of temperature and pressure micro-crack development in the rock mass. at relatively low temperatures, micro-crack propagation may be inhibited by the thermally-induced plasticity mechanism which occurs at crack tips and the increased bonding strength through thermally-induced rock matrix expansion (which increases crack stress thresholds). however, further increase of temperature creates thermally-induced cracks and causes the grain boundary cracks to widen, resulting in early crack damage. further, with the inﬂuence of conﬁnement, micro-crack development is suppressed, causing a relatively low increment of crack damage stress threshold ratios at higher conﬁnements. 3.5. corresponding alterations in granite micro-structure a comprehensive micro-structural analysis was also performed to identify the interior correspondences of the above-described temperature-dependent mechanical behaviour of granite. sem and optical microscopic analyses were performed on thin sections of granite specimens at various temperatures: room temperature (20 ◦c), pre-heated (72 hours) to 200 ◦c and 400 ◦c (fig. 13). these temperatures were selected to identify the microstructural behaviour at 200 ◦c, at which the highest strength increment was observed, and 400 ◦c, at which clear thermally-induced rock mass weakening was observed. a specimen at room temperature was used as a control. based on optical microscope imaging, mineralogical assembling in the granite specimen could be identiﬁed by the colour and texture of each of the mineral assemblages. further, a detailed sem study was performed using scanning electron imaging (sei) and bsei back-scatter electron imaging (bsei) techniques. bsei images taken at low magniﬁcations clearly show different mineral assemblages and grain boundaries (see fig. 14). using energy-dispersive x-ray (edx) technology with aztec oxford instruments, chemical component mapping was generated in each specimen, and each mineral was identiﬁed qualitatively. the bright colour images observed in edx images indicate higher concentration (higher energy dispersion) while dark colour areas indicate lower concentration (lower energy dispersion). based on the spectrum of each point (point id), the corresponding mineral was identiﬁed and a map spectrum provided overall elements available for each specimen. according to figs. 13 and 14, there are clear mineralogical assembling in the granite specimens, mainly with quartz, kfeldspar and plagioclase. the heating of granite up to 200 ◦c temperature has not caused any signiﬁcant thermally-induced micro-cracks (in addition to the pre-existing faults and grain boundaries) and almost all grain boundaries remain intact. however, further heating of granite to the higher temperature of 400 ◦c caused the induction of some micro-cracks, mainly along\\x0cw.g.p.  / geothermics 65 (2017)

however, only a few grain\\x0c56 w.g.p.  / geothermics 65 (2017) 44–59 fig. 13. optical microscopic and sem images of thin sections of strathbogie granite (a) at room temperature; (b) pre-heated to 100 ◦c (c) pre-heated to 400 ◦c. boundaries have been partially parted and a signiﬁcant number of grain boundaries appear to remain intact up to this temperature. furthermore, based on the edx mapping, it was conﬁrmed that intra-granular cracks are mainly initiated along the feldspar and quartz minerals. intragranular cracks were mainly observed in larger crystals (crystals greater than 0.5 mm) and smaller crystals remained un-parted even at 400 ◦c. for strathbogie granite, thermally-induced intra-granular micro-cracks seem to play a signiﬁcant role at relatively low temperatures, probably due to the presence of relatively high k feldspar and biotite contents. similar observations have been reported in bauer and johnson’s (1979) study conducted for charcoal granite, where intra-granular microcracks predominantly occur compared to grain boundary cracks. the sem analysis is also consistent with this ﬁnding, which exhibits inhibition of micro-crack development followed by micro-cracking at relatively high temperatures. the crack propagation process in any rock mass is largely inﬂuenced by the mineralogical composition, because cracks normally propagate through weaker planes of the rock mass. since granite is an igneous type of rock, two main types of thermallyinduced cracking modes can be identiﬁed: inter-granular and intragranular. the amount of inter-granular or intra-granular cracking is dependent on the stress state, rock type and mineralogy of the rock mass. inter-granular cracks occur along grain boundaries, pre-existing faults and micro-cracks of the rock, while intragranular cracks occur through weaker mineralogical constituents (kranz, 1983). for example, k feldspar and biotite are weaker mineralogical constituents due to their large crystals (>10 mm), as crystals greater than 2–3 mm in size are generally deﬁned as weaker mineralogical constituents compared to equi-dimensional small crystals like quartz (homand-etienne and houpert, 1989). based on experimental results, intra-granular cracking is highly temperature-dependent due to the temperature dependent dislocations in the rocks. this is because different mineralogical components have different thermo-elastic moduli and thermal conductivities (kranz, 1983; , 2008). these observations suggest that micro-cracking in granite is highly temperature dependent, as evidenced by the previously observed initial strength gain followed by slight strength reduction with increasing temperature in the tested granite. however, this shows that granite needs to be heated to a sufﬁcient temperature to cause thermal cracks in it and therefore, heating to a lower temperature may only cause a strength gain through the thermal expansion of the rock matrix. this is consistent with the results of bauer and johnson (1979). the mechanical properties of charcoal granite in their study remained relatively steady until 200 ◦c, and westerly granite exhibited a signiﬁcant thermal dependency, even at relatively low temperatures (<200 ◦c). in homand-etienne and houpert (1989) study, the variation of uni-axial compressive strength of both semones and remiremont granites is insigniﬁcant until 400 ◦c, followed by signiﬁcant reductions at higher temperatures. these results indicate the dependency of mineralogical composition and grain size distribution on the temperature dependent mechanical behaviour in various types of granites. however,\\x0cw.g.p.  / geothermics 65 (2017) 44–59 57 fig. 14. bse images of strathbogie granite with edx mapping: (a) thin section at room

30, 60, 90 mpa) and four different temperatures (rt, 100, 200, 300 ◦c), simulating various geothermal reservoir conditions. the following conclusions can be drawn: mechanical behaviour of the tested granite is inﬂuenced by both reservoir depth and temperature, and the depth effect is much greater than the temperature effect. granite located at relatively smaller depths appears to fail through shear localization and increasing depth may cause this to change to ductile failure through strain hardening. a progressive enhancement in stress threshold with increasing conﬁning pressure is observed in strathbogie granite. such behaviours exhibit greater strength and lower brittle characteristics in granite located at greater depths. increasing of temperature causes granite’s strength to be enhanced up to a certain temperature (around 200 ◦c for strathbogie granite) through the possible thermal expansion of the rock matrix and further increasing of temperature may cause it to weaken by inducing thermal cracks. this was conﬁrmed by the micro-structural analysis, which did not reveal any noticeable amount of thermally-induced micro-cracking in strathbogie granite up to 200 ◦c, and heating of the granite to a greater temperature as 400 ◦c caused many intra-granular cracks in quartz and feldspar and some grain boundary cracks between quartz and feldspar minerals. furthermore, according to ae analysis, increasing the temperature ﬁrst causes the crack propagation stress threshold to increase and further increasing of the temperature causes it to be slightly reduced. this indicates a suppression of micro-cracks at low temperatures by matrix expansion and the development of micro-cracks through thermally-induced damage at higher temperatures. finally an attempt was made to improve the conventional mohrcoulomb failure criteria for geothermal reservoirs with extreme pressures and temperatures, because the conventional criteria are not applicable to extreme conditions.

the existing studies described above were conducted on preheated specimens, which really cannot represent the real in-situ ﬁeld situation in geothermal reservoirs. the present study may therefore capture more realistic geothermal reservoir behaviour. 3.6. temperature-dependent failure criteria for strathbogie granite ≤ (3) − is questionable, due to the to date, although many strength criteria are available for intact rock, the practical application of most of them for geothermal reservoirs in-situ model parameters required when considering the available high-pressure and high-temperature environment in underground reservoirs. of the various failure criteria, the mohr-coulomb failure criteria have been extensively used in the ﬁeld and have made a signiﬁcant contribution to the determination of rock mass failure. however, they have some major limitations, including ignoring the intermediate stress (cid:2)2 inﬂuence (which has been proven to have a substantial inﬂuence on rock strength) and the assumed linearity (the strength criteria of rock are non-linear in reality). after re-analyzing thousands of reported triaxial experiments and combining the critical state concept proposed by barton (1976),  (2011) proposed a non-linear mohr-coulomb failure criterion. according to the ﬁndings of  (2011), the mohr-coulomb shear strength parameters should only be obtained by performing conventional tri-axial tests under low conﬁning stresses (in the linear region of the mohr-coulomb failure envelope). according to their statistical analysis, (cid:2)cc ≈ (cid:2)crit, where (cid:2)c and (cid:2) crit are uni-axial compressive strength and critical conﬁning pressure, respectively. the modiﬁed mohr-coulomb failure criterion proposed by  is given below: (cid:2)1 − (cid:2)3 = where, (cid:2)ci ≈ (cid:2)ci + 2sin(cid:3)i0 sin(cid:3)i0 ucs of the rock = 2ciocos(cid:3)i0/1 sin(cid:3)i0, (cid:3)i0 and cio are friction angle and cohesion obtained at low conﬁning

geothermal reservoir rocks at extreme pressures and temperatures, because the strength response is altered by the thermal effect (heuze, 1983). to date, no extensive study has captured this thermal response in the improved mohrcoulomb failure criteria. such a realistic approach is necessary for deep underground engineering applications like geothermal energy extraction. the concepts of barton (1976) and  (2011) are therefore incorporated into the temperature inﬂuence in this study and an attempt is made to propose novel strength criteria for geothermal reservoir rocks based on experimental data: + 2sin(cid:3)i (t) sin(cid:3)i (t) (cid:2)3 − − 1 − (cid:2)3 (t) = 2ci (t) cos(cid:3)i (t) sin(cid:3)i (t) 1 (cid:2)1 − (4) (cid:2)3 ≤ (cid:2)crit ≤ sin(cid:3)i (t)) (cid:2)32 for 0 −

wang, 2014). site selection for china's hlw repository started in 1985 (wang, 2010). the efforts have been focused on potential hlw repository sites located within granite intrusions in mainland china. since 1999, the beijing research ⁎ corresponding author. e-mail address: xingguang100@126.com (x.g. zhao). http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tecto.2016.06.021 0040-1951/© 2016 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved. institute of uranium geology (briug) has performed site characterization studies in the beishan area, china. so far, the beishan area has been considered as the most potential candidate area for china's hlw repository. among all the engineering properties of crystalline rocks at a potential hlw repository site, the thermal conductivity is one of the most important parameters in design consideration because it has a direct impact on the evaluation of the necessary repository volume and the optimization of the repository layout (sundberg and hellström, 2009). for instance, in the swedish kbs-3 concept for geological disposal of spent fuel, copper canisters with cast iron inserts containing the spent fuel are surrounded by bentonite for isolation and mechanical protection (, 2006). the heat generated by the spent fuel will increase the temperature of all components of the repository. for the bentonite buffer outside the canisters, the peak temperature must not exceed 100 °c. this requirement implies that the canisters cannot be deposited arbitrarily close to each other. on the other hand, unnecessarily large distances between the canisters will mean inefficient and costly use of the repository rock volume (, 2009). to fulfill the temperature requirement, the rocks with low thermal conductivities will\\x0cx.g.  / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137 125 lead to a larger distance between canisters than for a case with high thermal conductivities. this is because the rocks with low thermal conductivities will give rise to higher temperatures in the bentonite (, 2008). hence, to design and construct repositories successfully, it is essential to perform an accurate assessment of the thermal conductivity characteristics of the host rock. over the past few decades, various experimental approaches have been employed to measure the thermal conductivity of rocks. the results indicate that the thermal conductivity of rocks is closely associated with mineral composition, porosity, texture, and density, etc. (birch and clark, 1940; clauser and huenges, 1995; , 2005; , 2004; , 2015; , 2007; , 2009). for crystalline rocks with relatively homogeneous texture and low porosity, the mineral composition dominates the thermal conductivity. in volcanic and sedimentary rocks, the high variability of porosity in these rocks is a major factor controlling the thermal conductivity (clauser and huenges, 1995; , 2004). for example, increasing porosity, which acts as barrier to the ﬂow of heat, often results in both lower p-wave velocity and lower thermal conductivity values (, 2004). for a given rock, water content and temperature have an inﬂuence on its thermal conductivity. generally, the thermal conductivity of the rock increases and decreases with increasing water content (cho and kwon, 2010; , 2009) and temperature (, 2009; birch and clark, 1940; heuze, 1983; , 2014; , 2008; vosteen and schellschmidt, 2003), respectively. moreover, the effect of water saturation on the thermal conductivity of rocks shows a generally increasing trend with increasing porosity (nagaraju and roy, 2014). given that the thermal conductivity of surrounding rocks around the excavations will be changed by the excavation-induced stress, some researchers studied the inﬂuence of pressure on the thermal conductivity of rocks (, 2010; , 2009; , 2004; , 2008; sibbitt, 1976; walsh and decker, 1966; zimmerman, 1989). one of the main findings achieved from these investigations shows that the thermal conductivity varies with the pressure exerted on the rock. with increasing applied pressure, the thermal conductivity starts to increase and subsequently the increase rate tends to be a constant value due to gradual closure of cracks and pores within the rock (, 2008; walsh and decker, 1966). while the above-mentioned studies provide meaningful insight into the thermal conductivity of various rocks, the thermal conductivity characteristics of low-porosity crystalline rocks subjected to different external factors such as water saturation, temperature and compression stress have not been fully understood. on the other hand, the information on the thermal conductivity of rocks in a potential hlw repository site must be known with sufficient confidence to provide necessary input conditions for its long-term safety assessment, which is one of the motivations for this study. in this work, experimental investigations on the thermal conductivity of the beishan granitic rocks are conducted using the transient plane source (tps) method. in the following discussion, rock sampling and basic physical properties of the rock specimens are introduced first. testing facilities and procedures are then described. subsequently, the water saturation, temperature and compression stress dependent thermal conductivity characteristics of the tested rocks are evaluated comprehensively, and finally some insights are obtained. 2. rock sampling and preparation the beishan area is situated in gansu province of northwestern china (see ). after a long geological evolution and weathering process, the topography of this area is characterized by a ﬂat gobi and small gentle rolling hills with elevations ranging between 1400 and 2000 m above the sea level. the crust in this area possesses a blocky structure with many granite intrusions (see ). other surrounding rocks include mainly metamorphic and sedimentary rocks, as well as quaternary cover. rock sampling was carried out in the jijicao and xinchang rock blocks, which are currently considered as two of the key investigation sub-areas during site selection and characterization. . geographical location of the beishan area and a photo showing its typical topography.\\x0c126 x.g.  / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137 xinchang bs06 bs18 bs19 jijicao bs16 bs15 bs05 n 2.5 km granitic rock sedimentary rock metamorphic rock quaternary cover borehole fault . rock sampling from six boreholes in the jijicao and xinchang sub-areas for thermal conductivity measurements. intact drill cores with a diameter of approximately 63 mm were taken from six sub-vertical boreholes (i.e., boreholes bs05, bs06, bs15, bs16, bs18 and bs19) in these two sub-areas. the borehole locations are presented in . field observations indicated that the collected granitic rocks were relatively isotropic in texture and mineralogical composition. to evaluate the geological nature of the rocks, a series of thin sections were prepared and then exposed to cross-polarized light under an optical microscope to identify the dominant minerals in the rocks. the percentages of the dominant minerals were determined by point counting on thin sections. for each thin section approximately 500 points covering phenocrysts and groundmass were counted. according to the quartz-alkali feldspar-plagioclase (qap) diagram (streckeisen, 1976), the rocks can further be classified. it can be observed from  that the rocks contain mainly a moderate to low amount of quartz and alkali feldspar, and a moderate to high amount of plagioclase. this means that the collected rocks dominantly range from granodiorite to monzogranite. for grain size characteristics, the rocks are from fine grained to, medium to coarse grained. an overview of the basic information of the rocks is listed in . based on the borehole no. and sampling depth, these rocks have been divided into eight groups. a total of 47 pairs of rock specimens, 50 mm in diameter, were prepared from the drill cores with a length to diameter ratio of approximately 0.5. in particular, specimen ends were polished carefully using a q 90 90 i granodiorite ii monzogranite 60 60 ii i bs05 bs06 bs15 bs16 bs18-1 bs18-2 bs19-1 bs19-2 20 20 5 5 p 10 35 65 90 a . qap classification of the eight rock groups based on modal analysis. grinding machine until the ﬂatness and roughness of the ends are less than 10 μm and 3 μm, respectively. the ﬂat and polished specimen end surfaces minimize the thermal contact resistance during thermal conductivity measurement. a minimum of ten specimens for each rock group were prepared. 3. test methodology 3.1. an introduction to the used tps method in the fields of geology and geophysics, laboratory approaches to measuring soil and rock thermal conductivity can mainly be divided into two groups: steady state and transient state. in this work, the transient plane source (tps) method (gustafsson, 1991; log and gustafsson, 1995) was utilized to measure the thermal conductivity of the specimens. as one of the transient measurement methods, the tps technique is based on the use of a transiently heated plane sensor (i.e., hot disk sensor) and a hot disk thermal constants analyser (see a). the used hot disk tps2500s system can measure thermal conductivity of materials ranging from 0.01 to 400 w/mk. the hot disk sensor consists of a continuous double spiral, which is etched out of a thin nickel foil (e). this spiral is sandwiched between two sheets of electrical insulation materials made of kapton. the sensor acts both as a heat source for increasing the temperature of the specimens and as a dynamic temperature sensor for recording the temperature increase. during the measurement, the temperature in the sensor rises and heat starts to ﬂow to the specimens. the temperature rise in the sensor provides an indicator of the thermal properties of the specimens. if the specimens have good thermal conducting properties, the heat will be transported rapidly inside the specimens. on the contrary, if the specimens have good thermal insulation properties, the sensor temperature will rise faster and the heat will not be transported as much as in the test of the good thermal conducting specimens. compared with steady state measurement methods such as the divided bar (beck and beck, 1958; birch, 1950; , 1971) and the guarded hot plate (, 2009; , 2012), one of significant advantages of the tps technique is that the thermal conductivity of materials can be measured more quickly, typically from several to tens of seconds. hence, a long wait for thermal gradients to equilibrate is not required and the moisture migration in response to temperature gradients was minimized (jackson and taylor, 1986). on the other hand, unlike some transient methods such as thermal needle probes (barry-, 2013; von herzen and maxwell, 1959), which are commonly used for soils and soft rocks, the tps method can be\\x0cx.g.  / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137 127  basic information and geological description of the tested rocks. rock type and group basic information mineral composition naked eye observation photomicrograph of a thin section monzogranite (bs05) location: jijicao borehole no.: bs05 sampling depth: 5–7 m number of specimen pairs: 7 grain size: medium plagioclase: 33.7% ± 5.8%;

, 2003). hence, the thermal resistance between the specimen ends and the sensor exists (see section 3.2). so far, the tps technology has been widely used to\\x0c128 x.g.  / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137 a c temperature control system b hot disk thermal constants analyser sensor platen specimens d e specimens insulation material chamber sensor specimens oil bath sensor double spiral cable extension . the hot disk tps2500s system (a) used to measure the thermal conductivity of specimens under room temperature (d), high temperature (c), and uniaxial compression (b) conditions. a hot disk sensor showing its key components (e). determine the thermal properties of different materials (, 2015; , 2008; urquhart and bauer, 2015; , 2014; , 2012). 3.2. theory of the tps technique to theoretically describe how the tps method behaves, the thermal conductivity equation can be solved assuming that the hot disk sensor consists of a certain number of concentric ring heat sources located in an infinitely large sample (hot disk, 2007). a constant electric power supplied to the sensor results in an increase in temperature which is directly related to the variation in the sensor resistance (r(t)) by the equation: \\x10 \\x11 r tð þ ¼ r0 1 þ αδt τð þ ð1þ where r0 is the nickel electrical resistance in the beginning of the recording, α is the temperature coefficient of resistance of the nickel foil, and δtðτþ is the mean value of temperature rise in the sensor due to a constant current pulse given by: \\x10 δt τð þ ¼ p0 π3=2ak \\x11−1d τð þ ð2þ where p0 is the total output of power from the sensor, a is the sensor radius, k is the thermal conductivity of the sample that is being tested and d(τ) is a dimensionless time dependent function with: τ ¼ t=θð ð3þ þ1=2; θ ¼ a2=d where t is the time measured from the start of the transient recording, θ is the characteristic time, which depends both on parameters of the sensor and the sample, and d is the thermal diffusivity of the sample. according to eq. (2), and δtðτþ and d(τ) plotted as a function of τ provides a linear relationship with a slope that is a function of p0, a, and k. thermal conductivity k can be obtained by fitting the experimental data to the straight line given by eq. (2); thermal diffusivity d is calculated from eq. (3) taking into account the τ value determined in the previous fit. as mentioned above, the solution of the thermal conductivity equation is based on the assumption that the hot disk sensor is located in an infinite material in perfect contact with the sensor surface. this means that the heat ﬂow generated from each measurement must not reach the outside boundaries of the specimen (hot disk, 2007). meanwhile, a careful preparation of specimen ends is required to minimize thermal contact resistance. an estimation of how far the heat ﬂow has proceeded in the specimen during a recording is the probing depth δp, which is defined as (hot disk, 2007): ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ p dt δp ¼ 2 ð4þ to determine the thermal conductivity with good accuracy, the shortest distance from any part of the sensor to the nearest outside boundary of the sample should be larger than δp. in our experiments, the used hot disk sensor has a radius of 6.403 mm. the shortest distance is about 19 mm, and the probing depth is approximately 10 mm. for this probing depth value, we can consider that we are conducting a bulk measurement. 3.3. test procedures 3.3.1. tests on specimens under saturated and dry conditions firstly, the specimens were immersed by deionized water in a vacuum for a period of 96 h. the specimens were then taken from the vacuum and the water droplets on the surfaces were wiped dry, care being taken to ensure that no rock grains or fragments were lost. the mass of the water-saturated specimens (msat) was measured using a\\x0cx.g.  / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137 129 loading measurement 60 50

precision balance (to 0.0001 g). our tests revealed that the mass of the specimens could be approximately constant under vacuum within 72 h (see ), indicating that the specimens were saturated with water. subsequently, the hot disk sensor was horizontally placed between the two saturated specimen pieces with the double spiral centered and totally covered, and the two specimen pieces were firmly clamped together to ensure that there was no air gap between the sensor and the specimen end surfaces, as presented in d. in order to remain water saturation, the saturated specimens and the sensor were kept in a plastic bag during thermal conductivity measurement (adl-zarrabi, 2004). after the test, the used water-saturated specimens were suffered from dehydration treatment in a thermostatic drying oven at 105 °c for a period of 24 h and subsequently cooled in a desiccator to measure the thermal conductivity under a dry condition. meanwhile, the mass of the dry specimens (mdry) was measured, and the porosity (n) of the specimens was calculated using the equations n ¼ 100v p v % v p ¼ msat − mdry ρw ð5þ ð6þ where v is the bulk rock volume, vp is the pore volume, and ρw is the density of water. for each pair of specimens saturated or dried, measurements on the thermal conductivity were carried out at room temperature (25 ± 1 °c). 3.3.2. tests on specimens under increasing temperature to investigate the effect of temperature on the thermal conductivity of the tested rocks, measurements were performed on dry specimens from 40 °c to 150 °c based on the requirements of the used test equipment. compared with measurements at room temperature, the experiments under high temperature are time consuming due to a slow stepwise heating process by using a constant temperature oil bath and a temperature control system, as shown in c. the thermal conductivity measurement can only be conducted until the two specimen pieces in the chamber with a specimen holder within the oil bath have reached thermal equilibrium and kept a target temperature value. during thermal equilibrium of the oil bath, the hot disk sensor monitors continuously the temperature variation of the specimens. for our tests, the thermal conductivity of the specimens was measured when the recorded temperature variation of the specimens is less than 0.04 °c. in general, 32 h were needed to complete

measurement, the load was maintained constant for a period of about 15 min to avoid residual temperature drifts on the specimens. based on the in-situ stress measurement results obtained from the beishan area (, 2013), the maximum axial compression stress applied to the specimens was set to be 45 mpa to approximately simulate the excavation-induced stress near the vertical hlw disposal element boundary at a depth of 600 m. the axial stress applied to the specimens was recorded automatically, and the used stress path throughout the course of testing is presented in . the experiments were conducted at room temperature. according to previous experimental results (, 2015a; , 2015b), the identified crack initiation stresses of cylindrical specimens of beishan granitic rocks under uniaxial compression using the cumulative ae hit (caeh) method range from 45.3 to 109.1 mpa, which are larger than the maximum compression stress adopted in the present study. hence, the stress-induced rock damage might not occur in the tested specimens during loading. it should be mentioned that in the process of loading, the friction may occur at the interfaces between the specimen ends and the sensor. due to limitation of the tps measurement technique, the utilized test method does not consider the potential inﬂuence of interface friction effect on the experimental results. to reduce or eliminate the friction effect, further efforts are needed to produce innovative design for the test equipment. although not perfect, the developed test system provides a feasible means for us to gain insight into thermal conductivity behaviors of rocks under compression. 4. test results 4.1. inﬂuence of water saturation on the thermal conductivity  porosity, thermal conductivity and effect of water

about how the gradual heating and the thermal equilibrium processes would affect the water content of the specimens, leading to difficulties in evaluating the relationship between the thermal conductivity and the water saturation degree of the specimens quantitatively. 3.3.3. tests on specimens under uniaxial compression the uniaxial compression tests on dry specimens were conducted using a hydraulic servo-controlled compression machine. for each test, two specimen pieces with the hot disk sensor were contained between steel platens machined to match their end surfaces, as shown in b. the interfaces between the specimens and the steel platens were daubed with a thin layer of lubricant to reduce the end effect of the platens during loading. when the experimental setup was completed, axial-load control was used with a loading rate of 100 n/s and the axial load was increased with an increment thermal conductivity measurements were carried out on the 40 pairs of specimens both in dry and water-saturated conditions, and the results are listed in . a statistical analysis shows that for the eight rock groups under dry or saturated state, the standard deviation (sd) and coefficient of variation (cov) of the thermal conductivity are all less than 0.06 w/mk and 4%, respectively, indicating that the results between specimens in each rock group have a good consistency. for all rock groups, the average thermal conductivity values in the dry state (kdry) range between 2.412 and 2.812 w/mk. the values under watersaturated condition (ksat) for the same set of specimens

higher thermal conductivity (0.604 w/mk) replaced the air with a lower thermal conductivity (0.025 w/mk) in the void of the rocks, leading to an increase of the thermal conductivity. for our data set,

is seen that the thermal conductivity of the specimens shows a decaying trend with increasing temperature, and the values at 150 °c range from 5.7% to 8.7% lower than those at room temperature. this means that within the used temperature range, the inﬂuence of the increasing temperature on the decay of thermal conductivity for these rocks is limited. on the other hand, a possible reason for the gradual decrease in thermal conductivity is the generation of thermally induced microcracks in the rocks because of a mismatch between thermal expansion coefficients of adjacent mineral grains in a homogeneous temperature field (, 1993), which has been demonstrated from a microcracking perspective based on numerical simulations (zhao, 2016). based on the experimental data, the relationship between thermal conductivity and temperature can be described using the equation: k ¼ kr − at2 ð8þ where kr is the thermal conductivity of the rock at room temperature (25 °c), t is the temperature in celsius, and a is the fit coefficient (see ). the parameter a affects the decaying velocity of the thermal conductivity with the temperature, i.e., the decaying velocity of the thermal conductivity increases as a increases. as shown in , a in eq.

clauser, 2009) have been proposed. comprehensive overviews and case studies on such mixing models can be found in (, 2009; clauser, 2009; , 2013; hartmann, 2005; , 2015). based on the experimental data (see ) in combination with the methodology used by  (2013), the abovementioned mixing models were used to predict the thermal conductivity values of the tested rocks in the water-saturated state.  shows the comparison between measured and calculated thermal conductivities for the four different models. it can be observed from a, b, and d that the geometric mean, the arithmetic mean, and the effectivemedium mean yield similar prediction results and consistently underestimate the thermal conductivity of the eight rock groups, especially for the groups with relatively high porosity values (e.g., groups bs05 and bs15). the hashin–shtrikman mean shows a reasonably good fit for all rock groups, as shown in c. the analysis results are basically in line with observations reported by  (2013) because most of the evaluated mixing models used in their analysis also underestimate the thermal conductivity of the rocks. however, the geometric mean model was rated as the best fit to their data set. it should be noted that the rocks used in their analysis covered different rock types with a large range in porosity, from almost zero to about 30%. in addition, the measured thermal conductivity values of these rocks spans the interval between 1.0 and 6.5 w/mk. the present investigations focused mainly on the granitic rocks with low porosities and a narrow thermal conductivity range. hence, the large difference of rock properties may result in uncertainties between analysis results obtained from various mixing models. more work is required to explain this discrepancy. nagaraju and roy (2014) defined the effect of water saturation on thermal conductivity (s) as a function of porosity of rocks, and s is expressed by s ¼ ksat − kdry ð7þ kdry according to the measurement results listed in , we established the relationship between s and the porosity of the rocks, as presented in . analysis of  reveals that the effect of water saturation on thermal conductivity of rocks presents an increasing trend with an increase of porosity. a linear form expression can fit the data reasonably well while ensuring that the line passes through the origin. 4.2. inﬂuence of temperature on the thermal conductivity  presents the variation of thermal conductivity of seven pairs of dry specimens in different rock groups with temperature from 40 °c  fit coefficient a for thermal conductivity-temperature curves of seven pairs of specimens in different rock groups. rock type and specimen no. monzogranite (bs05-07) granodiorite (bs06-05) monzogranite (bs15-07) granodiorite (bs16-05) monzogranite (bs18-1-08) granodiorite (bs18-2-05) monzogranite (bs19-1-07) a (10−6) 8.821 5.679 8.394 4.871 6.891 5.728 6.385 r2 0.9830 0.9334 0.9853 0.9289 0.9262 0.9581 0.9933 132 x.g.  / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137\\x0cx.g.  / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137 133 n=2 20 10 axial stress (mpa) 30 40 n=3 20 10 axial stress (mpa) 30 40 50 50 3.4 3.3 3.2 3.1 3.0 2.9 2.8 2.7 2.6 2.5 2.4 c thermal conductivity (w/mk) 50 0 f 2.9 2.8 2.7 2.6 2.5 2.4 thermal conductivity (w/mk) 50 0 n=3 20 10 axial stress (mpa) 30 40 n=3 20 10 axial stress (mpa) 30 40 bs05 bs06 bs15 bs16 bs18-1 bs18-2 bs19-1 bs19-2 y=24.15-24.99e-x (r2=0.9296) 21 18 15 12 0369 i r(%) n=1 20 10 axial stress (mpa) 30 40 50 0.0 0.3 0.9 1.2 0.6 porosity (%) 1.5 1.8 b 3.0 2.9 2.8 2.7 2.6 2.5 2.4 thermal conductivity (w/mk) 50 0 3.2e 3.1 3.0 2.9 2.8 2.7 2.6 2.5 2.4 thermal conductivity (w/mk) 50 0 3.2h 3.1 3.0 2.9 2.8 2.7 2.6 thermal conductivity (w/mk) 50 0 n=3 20 10 axial stress (mpa) 30 40 n=3 20 10 axial stress (mpa) 30 40 n=2 20 10 axial stress (mpa) 30 40 3.0 2.9 2.8 2.7 2.6 2.5 2.4 2.3 2.2 a thermal conductivity (w/mk) 3.0d 2.9 2.8 2.7 2.6 2.5 2.4 2.3 2.2 2.1 2.0 thermal conductivity (w/mk) 3.0g 2.9 2.8 2.7 2.6 2.5 2.4 thermal conductivity (w/mk) 0 0 0 . inﬂuence of axial compression stress on the thermal conductivity of the eight rock groups: (a) bs05, (b) bs06, (c) bs15, (d) bs16, (e) bs18-1, (f) bs18-2, (g) bs19-1 and (h) bs19-2, and variation of the increase rate of the thermal conductivity (r) with rock porosity (i). error bars indicate the standard deviation of the thermal conductivity. n in the figures represents the number of specimen pairs in each rock group. we attempted to relate a with other rock parameters and found that a depended on the magnitude of rock porosity (n), as presented in . the coefficient a varies with porosity n according to the following equation: a ¼ 9:43 − 0:71=n2 ð9þ according to eqs.

(11) is not sensitive to the variation of rock porosity, and is within the range from 0.20 to 0.27 except for the rock group bs19-1. for simplicity, an average value of c = 0.24 obtained from  is used to approximately describe the trend, as shown in b. using eqs. (11)–(12) and the constant coefficient c, an overall fit is made for these rock groups to reproduce the rock porosity-dependent thermal conductivity under different axial stresses. a comparison between individual and overall fit results is presented in . it is found that for each rock group subjected to different compression stresses, the difference of the thermal conductivity values from the individual and overall fits is less than 0.05 w/mk. the good agreement indicates that the established rock porosity-dependent model can capture the nonlinear stress-thermal conductivity relationships of the beishan granitic rocks satisfactorily. 5. discussion one of the findings from the experimental investigations in the previous sections is that the rock porosity has an inﬂuence on the thermal conductivity of the beishan granitic rocks under water saturation, increasing temperature and compression stress conditions, although the porosity of tested rocks is relatively low. it is well known that for low-porosity crystalline rocks, the mineral composition plays an important role in dominating the thermal conductivity. the crystalline rocks are mainly made up of quartz, feldspars, and mafic minerals such as pyroxene, amphibole and biotite, and the content of minerals from these three mineral groups basically determines a rock's thermal conductivity (clauser and huenges, 1995). as mentioned in section 2, a model analysis on a total of 46 thin sections of the rocks was conducted to identify the dominant minerals in the rocks. as listed in , the main minerals of these rocks include quartz, plagioclase, k-feldspar and biotite. among these four minerals, quartz has the highest thermal conductivity (7.69 w/mk) while another three minerals have a thermal conductivity range between 1.70 and 2.29 w/mk (horai, 1971). hence, when the porosity values of the specimens in different rock groups are close to each other, quartz content in the rocks may determine the thermal conductivity. according to the data listed in , a presents the inﬂuence of quartz content on the average thermal conductivity of different rock groups in dry state. it is seen that except for rock groups bs05 and bs15 (which have relatively large porosity values of 1.37% and 0.68%, respectively), thermal conductivity of the rocks appears an increasing trend with increasing quartz content. when the specimens are subjected to compression stresses, the original pores and cracks in the rocks tend to close, and the effective contact areas between mineral grains increase, leading to a significant decay of the porosity effect on the thermal conductivity, especially for rocks with relatively high porosity. on the other hand, the closure of pores and cracks increases the contact opportunity of quartz grains, and hence improves the transportation capability of heat ﬂow in the rocks. under this condition, an obvious increase of the thermal conductivity for all rock groups with increasing quartz content can be observed, as presented in b. 6. conclusions beishan granitic rocks are candidate host rock types for china's hlw repository. in this paper, thermal conductivity characteristics of the beishan granitic rocks have been investigated using the transient plane source (tps) method. the measurement results indicate that for the used eight rock groups with a porosity range from 0.40% to 1.37%, the average thermal conductivity values in the dry state range between 2.412 and 2.812 w/mk. the values under water-saturated condition range from 2.602 to 3.156 w/mk. meanwhile, the effect of water saturation on thermal conductivity presents an increasing trend with an increase of rock porosity. using several mixing models proposed by previous researchers, we found that the hashin–shtrikman mean model showed a reasonably good fit to the experimental data while another three models currently obtained data, a best fitting equation of axial stressdependent thermal conductivity for these rocks can be expressed as (, 2004) k ¼ k0 þ bσ c ð11þ 1 where k0 is the thermal conductivity of the rock at zero stress, σ1 is the axial stress, and b and c are fit coefficients, as listed in . analysis of eq. (11) reveals that the coefficient b plays a critical role in controlling the increasing gradient of the thermal conductivity in the initial loading stage (i.e., crack closure stage). the coefficient c dominantly affects the increasing velocity of the thermal conductivity in the subsequent elastic deformation stage. based on experimental investigations on the thermal conductivity of some rocks subjected to uniaxial stresses using a steady-state apparatus developed by  (2004),  (2008) found that the parameters b and c depended on the magnitude of elastic modulus of the rocks, and subsequently established an elastic modulus dependent model to predict the thermal conductivity values under pressure. unfortunately, in the present study, the elastic moduli of the tested rocks have not been available. therefore, the model proposed by  (2008) cannot be used to fit our test results. according to , we found that the increasing gradients of the thermal conductivities in the initial

thermal conductivity of the rocks under the water-saturated condition. future work is demanded to verify the validity of various mixing models using different rock types with a large porosity range. with increasing temperature from 25 °c to 150 °c, the thermal conductivity of the rocks shows a decaying trend and the values at 150 °c range from 5.7% to 8.7% lower than those at room temperature, revealing that the inﬂuence of temperature on the thermal conductivity of the tested rocks is limited. in addition, the thermal conductivity of the rocks increases with increasing compression stress in a nonlinear behavior, and the increase rate of the thermal conductivity increases with an increase of rock porosity. it is found that the effects of compression stress and water saturation on the magnitude of thermal conductivity of the rocks are basically comparable. based on the experimental data, the empirical models considering the inﬂuence of rock porosity have been established for predicting the temperature and compression stress dependent thermal conductivity characteristics of the rocks, and the predictions are found to be in good agreement with experimental results. this study thus emphasizes importance of porosity on thermal conductivity measurements even for low porosity crystalline rocks. when the pores and cracks in the rocks tend to close during compression, quartz content may determine the thermal conductivity, and there exists an increase of the thermal conductivity with increasing quartz content. this is because the closure of pores and cracks increases the contact opportunity of quartz grains, and hence improves the transportation capability of heat ﬂow in the rocks. while the test results provide insights into the thermal conductivity characteristics of beishan granitic rocks, one should be aware of the limitation of this study. because the thermal conductivity of granitic rocks is inﬂuenced by many factors. in order to better understand the thermal conductivity of granitic rocks related to rock characteristics such as rock fabric, grain shape, grain contact and grain size, comprehensive petrographic investigations are recommended in the future. in the meantime, studies should be carried out to understand how the interactions between mineral components affect the thermal conductivity. work is also being conducted to investigate the thermal conductivity of the rocks under coupled thermal-hydro-mechanical conditions. acknowledgments this work has been supported by the china atomic energy authority through the

field: a blind fault captured by thermal–hydraulic simulation maren brehme1 guido bloecher1 mauro cacace1 yustin kamah2 martin sauter3 gue nter zimmermann1 received: 24 november 2015 / accepted: 4 july 2016 / published online: 19 july 2016 ó springer-verlag berlin heidelberg 2016 abstract subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow of reservoirs in active tectonic regions is mainly controlled by permeability of fault zones. therefore, the characterization of fault zones is an important step toward performance assessment of a reservoir. the ﬂuid ﬂow is controlled also by pressure and temperature conditions. in this context, we simulated pressure and temperature fields to elaborate on the inﬂuence of permeability on subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow in the lahendong geothermal reservoir. thermal–hydraulic simulation is performed using a finite element approach. adjusting the permeability through 370 different cases, modeling results converged to the observed data within a misfit range of 0–7 %. the best fitting models identified a deep-seated fault that has previously not been traced at the surface. simulated temperature distribution suggests a prominent convective heat ﬂow, driven by an upward migrating and sw–ne oriented ﬂuid ﬂow. this hydraulic gradient causes a pressure drop along the reservoir. highpressure patterns are used to constrain recharge areas, in addition to infiltration measurements. discharge ﬂow occurs from sw to ne migrating also upward toward the hot springs. in that frame, thermal–hydraulic simulations identified previously unresolved subsurface faults, which & maren brehme

essential component to supply future energy demands. requires developing new geothermal sites and improving the performance of existing systems to satisfy continuously growing demand. the productivity of a geothermal field mainly depends on subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow, which in active tectonic regions is controlled by permeability of fault zones (moeck 2014). in that frame, the primary focus is on locating and characterizing faulted areas in geothermal fields. this study employs numerical modeling to allocate and quantify permeability anisotropies and discontinuities, e.g., faults, in order to understand their inﬂuence on subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow in geothermal reservoirs. numerical models have been increasingly used to understand the setup and productivity of geothermal systems. a general overview of geothermal models has been given by o’ (2001). additionally, there are several sites exemplifying similar characteristics as in lahendong. the underground movement of hot and cold ﬂuids has been modeled for geothermal fields in new zealand ( 2014). the kakkonda geothermal site, e.g., consists of two reservoirs at various depths with different ﬂuid properties. there, results from ﬂuid ﬂow analysis show the importance of fractures for ﬂuid transport enhancing the recharge or discharge in the reservoir 123\\x0c1088 page 2 of 11 environ earth sci (2016) 75:1088 ( 1995). generally, faults acting as preferential ﬂuid path ways significantly change the pressure and temperature field in the reservoir ( 2013). models for the seferihisar–balc¸ova field focus on the ﬂuid ﬂow inside of faults. results show an enhanced upward heat transport through ﬂuids from bottom of the geothermal system ( 2011). our test ground is the lahendong geothermal field located in sulawesi, indonesia. the field is owned and operated by p.t. pertamina geothermal energy and hosts a power plant with a production capacity of 80 mwe. there, geothermal exploration started in the early 1970s including geophysical and geohydrochemical approaches. it is a water-dominated magmatic structurally controlled system. faults generally act as across-fault ﬂuid barriers and alongfault ﬂuid conductors ( 2014). as a result, hot springs mainly appear on the top of vertically permeable faults at the surface. available numerous drilling and surface measurements allowed a detailed characterization of the geological and hydrogeological setting of the area (;  2011, 2013, 2014, 2016;  2013). the model presented here is developed for investigating subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow and the permeability distribution including the fault zones in the lahendong geothermal field. below, the geological structure of the field is presented followed by an introduction to the modeling approach. detailed investigation of subsurface permeability distribution is a crucial step for site selection and smart drilling strategies. the numerical simulations presented will provide insight into understanding the subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow considering the hydraulic conductivity of faults. it ensures productive as well as sustainable operation of geothermal fields avoiding risks, such as drilling into non-fractured or cold zones, and targeting highly corroding waters. although the target area is lahendong, the general workﬂow is applicable for other geothermal sites consisting of similar constraints. reservoir characterization hydrogeology the overall driving force for the ﬂuid ﬂow is the sw–ne oriented natural hydraulic gradient in the lahendong geothermal system. the direction of ﬂuid ﬂow varies through the geothermal site due to horizontal partitioning of the reservoir by relatively less permeable fault zones ( 2014). the basic sections are located in the  topographic map of the study area with geological features, water and rock sample locations, and model cross section 123\\x0cenviron earth sci (2016) 75:1088 page 3 of 11 1088 south, in the east, and beneath lake linau. beneath lake linau, the direction of ﬂuid ﬂow is slightly rotated to wsw–ene (). also, types of ﬂuid change from one section to another, e.g., an acidic highly saline-type beneath lake linau and a neutral low saline-type south and east of lake linau (). the impermeable structure across faults prevent the ﬂuids from diluting each other ( 2016). however, faults are rather permeable along the vertical axis, which allows recharge of the system through the faults. rainwater infiltrates at a fault in the sw, at mt. lengkoan, and creek water infiltrates into the normal faults at lake linau (). the hydrothermal system discharges into lake linau and toward the ne, as driven by the hydraulic gradient ( 2014). the fracture network along the area is characterized by strike slip faults and normal faults. the sinistral faults strike n 40° and steeply dip toward the se. left step over on the strike slip faults forms an extension basin in the central study area. normal faults at the extension basin strike nw and dip 70°–80° beneath lake linau ( 2014). lithology lahendong area is mainly characterized by pre-, postand tondano formation of plioto pleistocene age ( 2010). the rocks are typically andesite, volcanic breccia, and tuff. those types have been sampled from borehole cores and used to determine porosity, permeability, and thermal conductivity. effective porosity and matrix permeability have been analyzed using a cylindrical-shaped specimen with a dimension of 5 cm x 5 cm 9 2.5 cm oriented parallel to the coring ( 2016). thermal conductivity has been measured on plain sections of dried cores. the experimental setup consists of a gas permeameter for determining matrix permeability ( 2011), of an helium pycnometry for effective porosity measurements (johnson- 1994) and of an optical scanner for thermal conductivity measurements ( 1999). these parameters have been measured and averaged for the three rock types ( 2016; ). andesite has an effective porosity of 3.7 %, a permeability of 2.1 9 10-14 m2, and a thermal conductivity of 1.8 w m-1 k-1 (dry) or 2.2 w m-1 k-1 (saturated). tuff has a porosity of 7.7 % but the lowest permeability of 2.0 9 10-15 m2 of 1.6 w m-1 k-1 (saturated). volcanic breccia is a permeable layer with an effective porosity of 10.5 %, a permeability of 2.3 9 10-14 m2, and a thermal conductivity of 1.6 w m-1 k-1 (dry) or 2.5 w m-1 k-1 (saturated). reservoir

transport in saturated porous media are derived from conservation principles of linear momentum, mass, and energy (dhi-wasy 2009). details on the software and the parameterization can be found in diersch (2014). the model geometry is a 2d vertical sw–ne trending cross section extending 6 km in horizontal and 3 km in vertical direction. the direction of the profile has been selected to cover all relevant processes in the lahendong geothermal field: it cuts major faults and the production and injection wells, which are used for temperature and pressure calibration. furthermore, to the groundwater ﬂow direction, showing major ﬂuid ﬂow activities. the homogeneous and isotropic geological layers in the model are stratified nearly horizontally. faults in the middle of the model, striking perpendicular to the cross section, dip with 84° toward a cooling pluton beneath lake linau. details on structural and geological components of the modeled region have been presented in  (2014). is parallel it the numerical the mesh used for simulation in feflow consists of 45,264 nodes and 89,320 elements that are denser surrounding the faults because of expected gradients due to parameter contrasts. material properties of 123 elements are permeability, porosity, and thermal conductivity and set according to laboratory measurements (). however, properties of the faults and lake linau are slightly adapted to specific conditions. the definitions for the modeled grids along the faults are as follows: porosity is 30 % and thermal conductivity is 1.8 w m-1 k-1. corresponding grids for lake linau are defined by a porosity of 100 % and a thermal conductivity of 0.6 w m-1 k-1. the model simulates ﬂuid ﬂow and thermal transport in saturated media in steady state. initial values and boundary conditions fluid ﬂow boundary conditions in the model describe groundwater heads and recharge amounts (; ). the hydraulic head at the sw model boundary is 837 m and 500 m at the ne boundary. the sw hydraulic head represents infiltration of surface water into a fault, striking perpendicular to the model. hydraulic head at the ne border is adapted to borehole measurements in that area ( 2014). infiltration into the fault zones at lake linau is described by ﬂuid ﬂux boundary conditions. the quantity is 3.0 9 10-4 m s-1 the sw and 1.3 9 10-6 m s-1 at the ne fault distributed over 40 m fault width. groundwater recharge is set to 412 mm a-1 at the ne top surface (; ). fluid movement in for\\x0cthe model domain is constrained by no-ﬂow boundary at the bottom, recharge through the surrounding fault zones, and the low hydraulic heads in the ne model area. discharge of the system in the central study area is mainly toward lake linau and across the ne model boundary. initial hydraulic head for the whole model domain is 500 m. the heat is 116 °c km-1 at transport boundary conditions are time-invariant, fixed temperatures, and heat ﬂux (; ). thermal gradient the sw model boundary, and the temperature is constant 350 °c at the pluton. temperature of water infiltrating into faults and here mixing with shallow warm groundwater is 70 °c, while surface groundwater recharge is at 28 °c. temperature values are obtained from field and bore log measurements ( 2014). heat ﬂux is set to 100 mw m-2 at the bottom model boundary (; ). this value is fixed based on the studies from  (1998), nagao and uyeda (1995), and  (1998). initial temperature for the model domain is set as 116 °c km-1, according to the local thermal gradient. permeability determination initial values for permeability are defined based on laboratory measurements (). after each simulation run, modeled and measured temperature and pressure values have been compared at indicated observation points. in case of poor matching (errors [10 %), permeability has been adjusted until satisfactory results have been achieved. beneath lake linau, simulation results showed locally strong discrepancies between modeled and measured pressure and temperature (errors [45 %). adjustment of permeability in geological infiltration rates into faults, or hydraulic heads did not lead to acceptable results. only the implementation of strong permeability anisotropy throughout whole depth, i.e., an additional fault, resulted in minimization of errors (0–7 %). implementation has been accomplished by mesh adaptation to ensure appropriate behavior around the fault. by this procedure, permeability anisotropies have been located and characterized in detail throughout the model. layers, in general, defining a direction-dependent permeability improves the data fit rather than using similar permeabilities in all directions. this is probably due to the fractures increasing the permeability mostly in vertical direction. porosity and thermal conductivity remained constant throughout simulation. variation in porosity is negligible because it would directly be reﬂected in permeability, while thermal conductivity differences would only affect conductive heat transport, which is not dominant in the lahendong area ( 1998;  2014). 123 100c measurementa 500borelog ofmodel

to obtain the best fit to the measured data changing the absolute and relative permeability in geological elements. relative permeability refers to different permeabilities in horizontal and vertical direction. as a main result, a blind fault has been recognized beneath lake linau, which has not been known from former studies. simulated pressure and temperature are measured at five selected observation points, which represent boreholes with available bore logs for pressure and temperature. details on data are given in . the model with best data fit, out of 370 different models, is considered to generate the final model developed for lahendong. permeability distribution and identification of a blind fault distribution of permeability patterns in the reservoir has been conceived comparing temperature and pressure data in several wells. especially beneath lake linau, closely located wells show high variations in temperature and pressure. a drop of 100 °c and 18 bar along 300 m distance has been observed between well lhd 24 and lhd 28. models first showed high discrepancies between modeled and measured values in this area. however, after implementing another high anisotropic permeable structure between the observation points, models resulted in satisfactory results. the structure has ten times higher vertical environ earth sci (2016) 75:1088 permeability than horizontal permeability. this structure is assumed to be another fault zone located between two known faults with vertical dip and nw strike. this fault shows no trace at surface, because it is covered by lake linau. generally, modeled permeability distribution in the lahendong reservoir is direction-dependent and overprints the lithology. modeled permeability is generally higher than measured ones in the order of up to four magnitudes. this is due to fracture patterns, which are not detectable at core-sample scale. permeability patterns directly affect subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow and temperature and pressure distribution. permeability in the faulted zones and surroundings is lowest in the study area. especially the middle and ne fault, the shallow area beneath sw lake linau and the deep ne section of the ne fault show low permeabilities between 10-13 and 10-14 m2 (). the area between the middle and ne fault, the deep section ne of the sw fault, the sw fault itself and the whole model area toward the sw and ne boundary show higher permeabilities of 10-10 and 10-12 m2 (). permeability varies not only within the modeled area, but also in vertical and horizontal direction. in faults and the deep reservoir section in the ne, permeability is by a factor of 10 higher in the vertical direction than in the horizontal direction (). in the areas between faults, permeability is in some parts by a factor of 10–100 lower in the vertical direction. in the rest of the model, vertical and horizontal permeability do not differ ().  final adapted permeability and anisotropy distribution throughout

some wells existing in this region are of artesian-type. overpressure releases through high permeable zones beneath lake linau and discharges toward surface. the pressure drop is up to 20 bars across the faults (). temperature distribution temperature distribution along the lahendong geothermal reservoir suggests that convective heat transport is the dominating process in the reservoir rocks. isotherms generally follow the sw–ne oriented ﬂow pattern, the rise and the infiltration of ﬂuids. upwelling of isotherms between the faults verifies water rise toward lake linau. infiltration of cold water causes down welling of isotherms particularly on the northeast section of the model. temperature is locally increased at the bottom of the model surrounding the pluton (). subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow the absolute and horizontal/vertical permeability distribution controls local ﬂuid ﬂow in the lahendong reservoir. the general ﬂuid ﬂow, driven by the natural pressure gradient, is oriented from sw to ne. vertical infiltration occurs at faults at lake linau and at the sw boundary. discharge is across the ne model boundary (). the more detailed ﬂow patterns can be observed with streamlines, which show a ﬂuid ﬂow along highly permeable areas. calculated streamlines describe particle ﬂow within the model domain. a forward calculation shows how infiltrating water at the sw model boundary distributes through the reservoir. the backward calculation shows the source of ﬂuid particles arriving at the ne model boundary (). patterns show that hot groundwater ﬂows toward the faults beneath lake linau, where the ﬂuid ﬂow is disturbed by a rise in temperature and vertically high permeable layers. this causes a rise of groundwater in this model area (red forward streamlines in ). at the same time, cold water infiltrates into high permeable areas and distributes over the ne model domain (blue backward streamlines in ). it is clearly seen that the composition of the ne reservoir domain is dominated by coldwater infiltration into faults, while the production areas are characterized by hot water ﬂow (). discussion investigation of subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow in geothermal reservoirs is crucial for sustainable exploitation avoiding drilling into less productive areas. subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow might be locally inﬂuenced by fault zones or physical 123\\x0c1088 page 8 of 11 environ earth sci

infiltrating cold water ﬂowing towards ne model boundary properties of water (i.e. viscosity). the inﬂuence of these parameters on the ﬂuid ﬂow has been investigated in lahendong geothermal reservoir using hydraulic–thermal simulations. simulation results show the detailed permeability distribution in the reservoir including location of an additional fault zone. matching of measured and simulated temperature and pressure has been used as a tool for resolving the permeability distribution. temperature and pressure have been iteratively determined at several observation points (). generally, modeled values are in good agreement with observed ones (). nevertheless, some observation points give slightly different values for both pressure and temperature (lhd 4 and lhd 7) or only temperature (lhd 24). this is probably due to the complicated ﬂow processes or strong small-scale structural variation in fractured and faulted areas. furthermore, density variations, which could have not been included into simulation due to high temperatures, could cause variation of ﬂuid pressure. however, the average deviation of simulated pressure and temperature is 1 %. implemented model parameters are porosity, permeability, and heat conductivity. from those parameters, only permeability has been tested in a specific range during simulation. the inﬂuence of porosity and heat conductivity on ﬂuid ﬂow is negligible due to dominating convective heat ﬂow ( 1998). values implemented in the model are based on measured permeabilities, which represent matrix permeability of rocks. the measured matrix permeability, representing permeability in horizontal direction, is 1.5 9 10-14 m2 on 123 average, which remains within typical permeability range for fractured igneous rocks (schoen 2004). permeability for volcanic breccias ranges typically between 3 9 10-15 and 5 9 10-12 m2 and tuff permeabilities range between 7 9 10-17 and 7 9 10-12 m2 (klavetter and peters 1987). in the wairakei geothermal field, simulating the impermeable layers resulted in permeabilities of 10-18 and 10-14 m2, in horizontal and vertical axis, respectively (mercer and faust 1979). however, permeability in reservoir rocks might be locally increased due to fracture formation. it might also be decreased due to alteration and sealing in faults. in lahendong, modeled permeability can be up to four magnitudes higher than measured ones in faulted areas. this is caused by fractures, which are not detectable in core scale. moreover, in fault cores, it is by a factor of 10 higher in vertical direction than in horizontal direction. however, in areas between faults (fault gauge), permeability is in some parts by a factor of 10–100 lower in the vertical direction. adaptation of permeability ensures a fit to measured temperature and pressure data. permeability in fractured areas is the main factor inﬂuencing subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow and temperature distribution in the lahendong reservoir area. subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow is driven by local hydraulic heads, which show high variations at different sections of the study area. consequently, convective heat distribution leads to high temperature variation along the reservoir. these phenomena are observed in lahendong as well as comparable fields. in new mexico, water level drops of 30–100 m are observed across (haneberg 1995). high several

measured temperature and pressure at selected observation points. well specifications and measured data from  (2014) temperature drops and upwelling of isotherms indicate that fault zones control the ﬂuid ﬂow in the lake long and valentine fields, usa (hooper 1991). the analysis of ﬂuid pressure differences at the alpine fault, new zealand, allowed to characterize the change in permeability between hanging and footwall blocks ( 2012). in summary, high pressure or temperature gradients are indicators for ﬂuid barriers between observation points. in other words, reservoir sections of different properties are separated by horizontally less permeable faults. in lahendong, most significant ﬂuid barriers are faults to the sw and to the ne of lake linau. across these barriers, the pressure drops up to 20 bars. a similar pattern has been measured in bore logs beneath lake linau, where no surface trace of a fault had been observed in former studies. however, only by implementing another fault, modeled and measured values could have been adapted. the recently identified fault zone beneath lake linau remains under lake water and therefore is only traceable by this kind of reservoir modeling. additionally to fault identification, the internal structure of known fault zones has been understood in detail. the ne fault, i.e., shows a displacement at 2 km depth. the detailed trend has been understood by permeability adaptation in this area. due to low permeability in horizontal direction in the faults, ﬂuids propagate mostly vertically toward the hot springs at surface. it also allows surface water to infiltrate into the reservoir in case the pressure within the fault zone is low enough (). this vertical ﬂuid movement eventually controls the temperature distribution in the reservoir. upward migration of deep hot water increases the temperature, while infiltration of cold surface water causes local drop of temperature. in summary, the most important factors inﬂuencing the reliability of numerical reservoir models are absolute and different horizontal and vertical permeability. however, a permeability adaptation has been done for each geological layer; the vertical permeability anomalies are overprinting those layers and are constraining the regional groundwater ﬂow. those permeabilities of fractures directly inﬂuence the productivity of the reservoir ( 2013). therefore, their permeability characteristics should be investigated in detail. in a previous study, a numerical model for the lahendong site has been set up in tough2 and aimed at forecasting the reservoir behavior during exploitation until the year 2036. with a production of 60 mwe, it predicts a pressure drop of 10 bars. however, the forecast results are uncertain due to lack of measured pressure draw down data (yani 2006). accordingly, the next steps of the presented study should include a realistic production and injection scenario in order reservoir exploitation. furthermore, chemical characteristics could be considered to achieve reliable production setups, because hydrochemical processes play an important role in the lahendong reservoir ( 2016). presented models from this study provide important information on ﬂuid ﬂow in the water-dominated lahendong reservoir. however, additional the two-phase ﬂow models of to support sustainable\\x0c1088 page 10 of 11 environ earth sci (2016) 75:1088 lahendong area are in progress to understand the inﬂuence of steam driven ﬂuid ﬂow in this high-temperature system. conclusion the primary focus of this study is to understand the inﬂuence of fault zones and permeability patterns on subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow in geothermal reservoirs. the ﬂuid ﬂow mainly depends on rock and fault zone permeability. these processes have been considered in numerical models, which simulate local temperature and pressure conditions. the initial reservoir conditions, which refers to the case before production starts. models are developed based on the conceptual models of the study area, which explain reservoir geometry, geological structures, temperature, and hydraulic conditions. temperature and pressure well-logs have been used for model calibration. the numerical models represent vertical and horizontal ﬂuid ﬂow is mainly controlled by fault permeability. this characteristic is used to simulate different reservoir sections, and vertical ﬂuid rise toward the surface. by stepwise adaptation of permeability fields, based on observed temperature and pressure gradients, an additional blind fault zone can be identified beneath lake linau. temperature and pressure significantly drop across that ﬂuid barrier. this behavior has been observed in comparable fields in the usa as well. the overall shape of ﬂuid ﬂow direction trends in a sw–ne direction. main recharge occurs by infiltration of surface water into the faults, especially in the southwest and near to lake linau. discharge is enhanced in highly fractured areas toward lake linau. vertical permeability of faults allows ﬂuids rising toward the hot springs at surface. results show that permeability has to be considered for simulation of a geothermal system. the geothermal system is mainly controlled by ﬂuid ﬂow in fractures/faults depending on temperature and pressure conditions. the locally modified ﬂuid ﬂow can considerably inﬂuence the productivity of a geothermal field. results also guide reservoir management in case of a potential for field extension, as performed in lahendong. acknowledgments the authors acknowledge the continuous support within

keywords: geothermal energy granite high temperature stress-strain response triaxial acoustic xrd geothermal heat has now been identified as an effective renewable energy source due to severe environmental impacts created by conventional fossil usage on global climatic change. however, its wide application has been limited due to the lack of knowledge, particularly of the geothermal conditions of reservoir rocks at elevated temperatures and pressures. such high temperatures and pressures possibly alter the mechanical properties of reservoir rocks due to the associated micro-structural and mineralogical alterations of the rock mass, which are an important attribute for wellbore stability and stimulation of geothermal reservoirs for safe and effective geothermal energy extraction. this study therefore investigates the stress-strain behaviour under in-situ stress and temperature conditions by conducting a series of high-pressure, high-temperature tri-axial experiments on australian strathbogie granite under four different confining pressures (10, 30, 60, 90 mpa) and four different temperatures (rt, 100, 200, 300 ◦c). the effect of temperature on the mechanical behaviour of rock specimens was studied under tri-axial conditions and the corresponding fracture propagation behaviour was observed using an advanced acoustic emission (ae) system. the corresponding micro-structure alteration in granite was observed using sem analysis. according to the findings, increasing temperature leads to an initial increment in reservoir rock strength and shear parameters followed by reduction, and the trend is aligned with the crack formation pattern of the rock mass. this was further confirmed by the sem analysis, according to which the rock micro-structure is subject to only minor changes at relatively low temperatures and higher temperatures cause micro-cracks to develop along the rock mass grain boundaries. furthermore, the conventional mohr-coulomb criteria failed to model the stress-strain response of rock under geothermal reservoir conditions, and was therefore modified for the corresponding in-situ conditions. © 2016

adequate temperatures to serve as a geothermal reservoirs (, 2013). such explorations involve finding vast blocks of “hot rocks” with fracture systems. such rocks can be used to generate electricity. in this process, water is first injected and circulated through the fractures in the geothermal reservoirs and eventually pumped back to the surface as steam. however, the exploration of geothermal resources has become a challenge to engineers and geologists, due to the high temperature and stress environments in geothermal reservoirs. for this reason, laboratory experiments conducted under high pressure and temperature conditions (geothermal conditions) can assist in providing\\x0cw.g.p.  / geothermics 65 (2017) 44–59 45 basic predictions. a large number of laboratory experiments has therefore been conducted since 1970 to investigate the inﬂuence of high pressure and temperature on rock in relation to geothermal heat extraction (, 2016), deep geological disposal of nuclear waste (paquet and franc¸ ois, 1980), deep mining (wawersik and hannum, 1980) and geological co2 storage (, 2014). the mechanical behaviour of reservoir rocks is significantly inﬂuenced by elevated temperatures, because they cause the micro-structure of the rock mass to be altered through thermal expansion, the development of new micro-cracks, extending and/or widening the existing micro cracks and various mineralogical alterations. rock strength-deformation criteria change with temperature, and some rock mechanical properties, such as compressive strength, tensile strength, elastic modulus, cohesive strength and friction angle, decrease with increasing temperature (heuze, 1983; , 2008). however, such alterations are also affected by the confinement applying on the rock mass, and confining pressure causes the suppression of thermal cracks and the extension/widening of existing micro-cracks. this results in further alteration of the rock mass mechanical properties, resulting in changing failure modes (mogi, 1966). studies have identified the transition of rock failure mode from brittle to ductile with increasing confinement. however, this transition is diverse due to the different mineralogical compositions and grain boundaries in different rocks (, 2001; wong, 1982). although many studies have been conducted to investigate the temperature-dependent mechanical behaviour of reservoir rocks, most experiments have been conducted in unconfined environments (, 2015; , 2014). pre-heating the specimens to the corresponding temperature ranges and testing at room temperatures has been frequently done (bauer and johnson, 1979; , 2008), but the method is not reliable, as geothermal reservoirs experience continuous thermal stresses. such limitations have occurred mainly due to the limited number of appropriate test facilities available to simulate the stress and temperature conditions of actual geothermal reservoirs. although some studies have analytically and numerically evaluated the mechanical properties of rocks under high temperatures and pressures (chester and higgs, 1992; , 2013; , 2016), to date none has captured the stress-strain behaviour and failure criteria of rocks over a wide range of confining pressures and temperatures, particularly for australian granite. however, the thermo-elastic response and appropriate failure criteria are essential inputs for many engineering applications under high pressures and temperatures, including geothermal extraction applications. this study therefore intends to fill this gap, and it is hoped it will make an important contribution to many deep underground applications. 2. methodology 2.1. tested material granite is an abundant crystalline rock in the earth with medium to coarse grains which was formed as a result of the slow cooling of magma. granite therefore has abundant radioactive elements (k, th, and u). such elements bring elevated geothermal gradients to deep granite reservoirs, which therefore have ideal conditions as geothermal reservoirs. the mineralogical composition of granite mainly consists of quartz, feldspar, plagioclase and biotite, and small amounts of muscovite, amphibole, hornblende and opaque (, 2008). for the present study, samples were collected from the strathbogie batholith, which is a composite granitoid intrusion body spreading over more than 1500 km2 in 150 km north-east from melbourne (). strathbogie granite is a high-level, discordant . sampling location of strathbogie batholith in central victoria.  physical, mechanical and

(a) dilatancy and failure by strain softening under relatively low confining pressures and (b) failure by strain hardening under elevated confining pressures, and a transitional regime may be observed at intermediate pressures. these transitional failure modes have been referred to as “quasi-brittle”, and complex localized features such as conjugate shear bands can be observed under such conditions (, 2001; , 2004). by visual inspection of the post-failure samples, important information about the alteration of the granite failure mechanism with confining pressures and temperatures can be identified. postfailure images () were therefore collected after each test. according to the post-failure images, specimens that failed at 10–60 mpa confining pressures mainly failed by shear localization along an inclined macroscopic shear band with a single shear zone across each sample. however, samples tested at higher confinements of 90 mpa and 120 mpa (at 100 ◦c) exhibited strain hardening characteristics after achieving the peak stress, and several conjugate shear bands could be observed on the cylindrical sample surface, instead of the single shear band observed earlier. this characteristic was significant at 120 mpa confining pressure. however, it should be noted that only one test was conducted at 120 mpa confinement, because at such high confining pressures the corresponding failure load of granite exceeds the bottom pedestal’s load-bearing capacity. further, a progressive reduction was observed in the failure plane angle with respect to the minor principal stress direction with increasing confining pressure, which implies a reduction in friction angle, possibly due to the greater quasi-brittle behaviour that was shown by granite samples at higher confining pressures (, 2001). 3.2. effect of temperature and confining pressure on mechanical properties of strathbogie granite  illustrates the inﬂuence of temperature on the deviatoric stress of the tested granite under each confinement. as the figure shows, the inﬂuence of confinement is more significant than that of temperature in the temperature range considered here. wong and brace (1979) confirm that at lower confining pressures considerable thermal cracking occurs at relatively low temperatures. if thermal cracking is responsible for the reduction in failure strength, a sharp reduction in deviatoric stress with increasing temperature (with suppression of thermal cracks) should be exhibited under unconfined pressure condition. however, based on the experimental results, under unconfined conditions, up to 100 ◦c, 17.6% of increment in deviatoric stress is followed by 2.5% and 10.5% reductions at 200 ◦c and 300 ◦c, respectively. however, when confinement was applied, strength reduction was initiated after higher temperature of 200 ◦c, mainly due to the inhibition of a thermal cracks by induced compressive force. thermal cracking is therefore an important strength property alteration mechanism in reservoir rocks under certain confining pressure conditions. a clear inﬂuence of temperature on deviatoric stress at any depth or confinement can be observed, and increasing the temperature from room temperature to 200 ◦c causes an increment in deviatoric stress, and further increasing of temperature to 300 ◦c causes a slight reduction in it. this is because the thermal expansion which occurs with increasing temperature causes the reduction of .

which is only 0.19% of maximum measurement. during the load application, the axial strain was measured using linear variable differential transducers (lvdts) attached to the ram of the load cell ((a)). an acoustic emission (ae) system was also employed in the testing of samples to record the data related to the fracturing process. the ae system adopted was a peripheral component interconnection (pci) system with a nominal resolution frequency of 500 khz. during the experiments, two sensors were attached to either side of the loading shaft and with the external amplifiers, which generated low frequency acoustic waves with the fracturing of the sample. in addition, possible micro-structural and mineralogical changes that occurred during thermal and confinement effects were checked using sem analyses. 3. results and discussion 3.1. the overall stress-strain response the inﬂuence of temperature on the stress-strain behaviour of the tested granite was considered first

characteristics were relatively small up to 500 ◦c and beyond that an accelerated downward trend was identified. furthermore, wider localized zones were observed at high temperatures in the post-failure images. however, these studies were conducted at wider temperature ranges (up to 700 ◦c and 900 ◦c, respectively) and the researchers therefore did not pay close attention to reservoir rock behaviour under relatively low geothermal temperature ranges (<300 ◦c). this was the focus of the present study, according to which there is an initial strengthening and stiffening in granite with increasing temperature at low temperatures (up to 200 ◦c), and increasing the temperature beyond a certain value causes a gradual reduction in failure stress with increasing temperature. elastic modulus is an important mechanical property of any reservoir rock, and describes the brittle characteristics of the rock mass. it is therefore often used to evaluate many in-situ stress applications, including wellbore stability, fracturing possibility and tectonic stress distribution (heard and page, 1982). the temperature-dependent brittle properties (elastic modulus) of the tested granite were then evaluated. the elastic region of each stress-strain curve was used to calculate the temperature and pressure-dependent young’s moduli (e) and the results are shown in . the axial strain was measured using lvdts attached to the loading ram with a linearity ±0.1% f.s (full scale) (±0.0075 mm) and infinite resoluerror of tion (no hysteresis). an increment of the modulus of strathbogie granite with increasing temperature up to 200 ◦c can be observed, and further increase of temperature (to 300 ◦c) causes the elastic modulus to be slightly reduced for any confinement. this trend is\\x0ca ‘brittle’ or general increment in elastic modulus with increasing confinement can be observed until 90 mpa, and a further increase of confinement (to 120 mpa) reduces the young’s modulus considerably. with increasing confining stress additional plastic deformation occurs, exhibiting strain-hardening characteristics in granite under high confinements. however, within the range of the experiments conducted (10 mpa–120 mpa) it cannot be definitively identified as a ’ductile’ regime. however, the strain-hardening behaviour observed at 120 mpa indicates transitional characteristics and this can be identified as ‘quasi-brittle’ behaviour (, 2001). the initial young’s modulus reduction with increasing confinement was observed by heard and page (1982), who conducted tests up to 55 mpa confining pressure. however, the latter behaviour was not observed by these researchers. interestingly, according to the research literature, at low temperatures (<200 ◦c) some granite types are more temperature-sensitive, while in contrast, some granites are more temperature-sensitive at high temperatures. the initial strength enhancement is more significant for coarse-grained granites and granodiorite than for fine-grained granites. for example, according to heard and page (1982), stripa granite is more sensitive to temperature at relatively low temperatures (<200 ◦c), and westerly granite is more sensitive to temperature at high temperatures (>200 ◦c). such contradictory behaviours may occur in granite due to the different grain size distributions, grain orientations, mineralogical compositions and heterogeneity of different granite types. this indicates the importance of studying the mineralogical composition and microstructural inﬂuence of granites on such on temperature-dependent strength variations. 3.3. effect of temperature on shear strength parameters of strathbogie granite  illustrates the variation of deviatoric stress of the tested granite with confining pressure for each temperature. the figure shows that increasing confinement causes the granite’s deviatoric stress to increase non-linearly and gradually come to a steady state. this is consistent with similar previous studies, which have clearly shown the enhancement of rock strength with increasing confinement, and the increasing rate is reduced with increasing confining pressure (barton, 2013; , 2011). this is because at low confining pressures there is a high dilation potential. therefore, the ability to open rock micro-cracks is high, resulting in higher friction angles. however, this dilation potential and the corresponding tendency for micro-cracks to open are suppressed with increasing confinement, resulting in lower friction angles at higher confining pressures. therefore, the failure mechanism of the rocks shifts from brittle to ductile with increasing confinement, changing the shape of the mohr-coulomb failure envelope, and according to barton (1976), at critical confining pressure the mohr-coulomb failure envelope reaches a zero gradient. this has also been shown by hoek (1983). the present study has clearly identified this rock behaviour in the mohr-coulomb failure envelopes developed for each temperature condition (refer to ). according to , the traditional linear mohr-coulomb criteria are applicable only in the brittle region of the failure envelope, and at higher confinew.g.p.  / geothermics 65 (2017) 44–59 consistent with the temperature-dependent strength behaviour of the granite described above. the reason for the initial elastic module increment may be that the specimen becomes more brittle at the initial temperature ranges due to thermally-induced volumetric expansion and the associated pore volume reduction. the later slight reduction of young’s modulus with increasing temperature exhibits an enhancement in ductile behaviour (quasi-brittle characteristics) with further increase of temperature. this is possibly due to the increased crack density caused by the induced thermal crack development and the related weakening of the granite. 600 500 400 300 200 100 0 50 σ1-σ3(mpa) 0 100 temperature (ºc) 200

angle and (b) cohesion with different temperatures (considering linear region of the mohr coulomb failure envelope). the latter positive effect of temperature on cohesion, according to wong and brace (1979), increasing the temperature to an extreme value may cause weakening of the grain boundaries, dependent on the anisotropy of the rock matrix (due to potentially existing distinct mineral compounds in granite those may contain different thermo-elastic moduli and this may causes to generate different internal stresses with heating). according to wong and brace (1979), increasing the temperature causes the induction of thermal cracks in the rock mass due to the associated generation of internal stresses (eq. (2)): (2) e(cid:4)˛(cid:4)t = \\u2434 where, e, \\x01␣, \\x01t is the matrix young’s modulus, difference of thermal expansion coefficient of distinct mineral and temperature difference, respectively. when the internal stress (given by eq. (2)) exceeds the crack closure pressure with increasing temperature, thermal cracks form and further increase of temperature provides the surface energy required for the propagation of the initiated crack (, 2007). this results in alteration of the grain-tograin contacts in the rock matrix, which leads to reduced cohesion at higher temperatures. in the case of the variation of friction angle with increasing temperature, the granite friction angle appears to remain steady up to around 100 ◦c (52◦) and then slightly increases with increasing temperature (54◦ at 200 and 300 ◦ c, respectively). the friction between grain-to-grain contacts may be altered by the thermally-induced micro-structural modifications. however, this effect on grain contact is expected to be smaller at relatively low temperatures, resulting in relatively steady friction angle with increasing temperature at lower temperatures. however, a slight ments non-linearity must be taken into account. in addition to the confinement, according to this study, increasing temperature also alters the failure envelope of granite. an initial increment in deviatoric stress with increasing temperature can be observed up to 200 ◦c and further increase of temperature (to 300 ◦c) causes it to be slightly reduced. the temperature-dependent shear parameters of granite were investigated next, and the shear parameters can be obtained from the mohr-coulomb failure envelope. as suggested by  (2011), the mohr-coulomb parameters (cohesion and friction angle) were calculated using eq. (1), taking into account the linear region of the obtained mohr-coulomb failure envelope (considering only smaller confining stresses, up to 30 mpa) for each temperature condition to obtain the temperature-dependent shear strength parameters ().

(continued) enhancement in friction angle with increasing temperature can be seen, probably due to the increased resistance of mineral particles to external deformation as a result of the thermally-induced energy in the mineral particles. however, compared with cohesion, the temperature dependency on friction angle is relatively insignificant within the temperature region considered here. initial enhancement in shear parameters in sandstone with increasing temperature has been observed by  (2015) at relatively low temperature regions, and these researchers observed reduction in friction angle from 33.02◦ to 31.93◦ and an increment a in cohesion from 61.47 mpa to 66.44 mpa with increasing temperature from 25 ◦c to 100 ◦c. further, bauer and johnson (1979) observed around 10% reduction in cohesion and 40% reduction in friction angle in westerly granite with increasing temperature from room temperature to 300 ◦c, and  (1979) observed 7% reduction in cohesion and a 38% reduction in friction angle a with increasing temperature from room temperature to 400 ◦c and 300 ◦c, respectively. however, the variation of shear strength parameters with increasing temperature at relatively low temperatures (<300 ◦c) was not considered in the above studies. the observed initial shear strengthening may be due to the inhibition of micro-crack propagation by the plasticity mechanism which occurs at crack tips (duclos and paquet (1991)) at low temperatures. with further increment of temperature, the reduction of shear strength parameters can be expected, due to the thermal weakening of the rock micro-structure. furthermore, according to the sem studies conducted by  (2007), large local plastic deformations and extremely rough cleavage fractures occur at relatively low temperatures. moreover, due to the volume expansion, the distance between the interfaces of the individual minerals decreases with the enhancement of their mutual attraction, and the strength of the bonds increases (dmitriev, 1972). both of these phenomena can be considered to explain the stress strengthening of granite under relatively low temperatures when subjected to confining pressures. 3.4. analysis of fracturing behaviour using ae technology acoustic emission (ae) detection technology is a powerful nondestructive tool to study crack propagation processes in brittle materials, including the stages of crack initiation, growth and crack damage (lockner, 1993). when a brittle material is under stress, strain energy is released during the development of new cracks or the widening of existing cracks. this energy is released in the form of elastic stress waves from the crack tips, and can be captured and amplified by an ae system. ae detection technology has therefore been widely used in a number of previous studies to understand the crack development mechanism in brittle materials (chang and lee, 2004; , 2000; , 2005). by incorporating the crack propagation pattern into the stressstrain relationship of the cracking material, the crack development process can be divided into several stages. hoek and bieniawski (1965) divided crack formation into five main stages: crack closure, crack initiation, secondary cracking, crack coalescence and crack damage. later,  (2008) and  (2015) incorporated stress-strain curves into cumulative ae counts/energy and strain plots. in the crack propagation process, with the gradual increment of loading on brittle materials, most pre-existing cracks are first closed, releasing an insignificant number of ae counts. this initial crack closure period is followed by the stable crack propagation period, which can be identified by the release of gradual ae energy increments. further increment of loading causes an exponential increase in ae energy, indicating an unstable crack propagation period with failure approaching. the crack closure threshold ((cid:2)cc) is defined as the stress threshold at which the initial ae counts are identified. anan initial increment in cumulative ae\\x0c54 w.g.p.  / geothermics 65 (2017) 44–59 counts can be seen at the crack initiation ((cid:2)ci) threshold, and the cumulative ae counts starts exponential growth at the crack damage ((cid:2)cd) threshold. the region between the crack closure threshold and the crack initiation threshold is generally defined as the stable crack closure region, where linear elastic deformation occurs. the region between the crack initiation threshold and the crack damage threshold is defined as the stable crack propagation region, and the region between the crack damage threshold and sample failure is identified as the unstable crack propagation region. the application of compressive loading fails rocks through either shear localization (brittle regime) or cataclastic ﬂow, and the surrounding conditions, such as temperatures and pressures, may cause a homogenous plastic ﬂow. according to existing studies, axial intra-granular cracking and shear rupturing of cemented grain contacts can be observed before failure in brittle regimes, and grain crushing and pore collapse can be identified before failure in cataclastic ﬂow regimes (, 1996). according to  (1997), the development of local stress concentrations leads to the initiation of many intra-granular micro-cracks in the rock mass, and the crack density increases with increasing deviatoric stress and tends to merge on reaching the peak stress, resulting in strain softening and shear localization. these damage processes are clearly identified by the intense ae activities in the field (chang and lee, 2004). ae technology was therefore used to investigate the progressive fracturing behaviour in strathbogie granite under tri-axial conditions.  illustrates the cumulative ae events with axial stress at various pressures and temperatures for the tested specimens. the corresponding variations of deviatoric stress against strain are also included in the same plots to identify the stress thresholds for crack closure, crack initiation and crack damage (). the very high ae counts in strathbogie granite at dilatancy in the pre-failure stage are due to the fact that ae waves generate when the local shear stress concentration at a grain contact is sufficiently high to rupture the grain boundaries, and frictional slips and grain rotations may occur once the grain contacts have lost their cohesion. in the present study, crack threshold ratios were defined to identify the temperature and pressure-dependent crack propagation in the tested granite as follows, and  shows the crack propagation stress threshold ratios of granite specimens tested at various confining pressures and temperatures. crack closure stress threshold = deviatoric stress at crack closure stress deviatoric stress at failure ((cid:2)cc) crack initiation stress threshold = deviatoric stress at crack initiation stress deviatoric stress at failure ((cid:2)ci) crack damage stress threshold = deviatoric stress at crack damage stress ((cid:2)cd) deviatoric stress at failure according to the results, the beginning of crack damage occurs at earlier stages of deviatoric loading for higher confining pressures. however, the crack damage stress increases with increasing confinement due to the inﬂuence of confining pressure on thermal crack development and the suppression of the extension/widening of existing micro-cracks. according to , in the temperature range considered here, three tendencies can be identified with increasing confining pressure: increase of the elastic deformation region, decrease of the stable crack propagation region, and increase of the unstable crack propagation region. the crack initiation stress threshold also progressively increases with increasing confining pressure, which can be attributed to the fact that the brittle behaviour of rock specimens at lower confining pressures changes to quasi-brittle behaviour with increasing confining pressure. this is because the suppression of micro-crack development is less at low confining pressures, and therefore sudden failures mostly occur, and the beginning of crack initiation occurs at earlier stages of deviatoric loading at high confining pressures due to the higher normal stress acting on micro-cracks, resulting in limited progression of cracking before failure. in relation to the temperature effect, increasing the temperature causes an initial increment in the crack propagation stress threshold, followed by a slight reduction for all the temperature conditions considered. for example, at 30 mpa confinement, the crack damage stress threshold ratios increased by around 6.8%, 10.5% with increasing temperature from room temperature to 100 and 200 ◦c, respectively, and reduced by around 4.0% when the temperature increased to 300 ◦c. this implies that at low temperatures a suppressed micro-crack development mechanism is dominant, and increasing the temperature causes crack damage to occur at earlier loading stages. interestingly, at 60 mpa confinement the crack damage stress threshold ratio increased by around 4.9%, 5.4%, 2.6% with increasing temperature from room to 100, 200 and 300 ◦c, respectively. this exhibits the cumulative effect of temperature and pressure micro-crack development in the rock mass. at relatively low temperatures, micro-crack propagation may be inhibited by the thermally-induced plasticity mechanism which occurs at crack tips and the increased bonding strength through thermally-induced rock matrix expansion (which increases crack stress thresholds). however, further increase of temperature creates thermally-induced cracks and causes the grain boundary cracks to widen, resulting in early crack damage. further, with the inﬂuence of confinement, micro-crack development is suppressed, causing a relatively low increment of crack damage stress threshold ratios at higher confinements. 3.5. corresponding alterations in granite micro-structure a comprehensive micro-structural analysis was also performed to identify the interior correspondences of the above-described temperature-dependent mechanical behaviour of granite. sem and optical microscopic analyses were performed on thin sections of granite specimens at various temperatures: room temperature (20 ◦c), pre-heated (72 hours) to 200 ◦c and 400 ◦c (). these temperatures were selected to identify the microstructural behaviour at 200 ◦c, at which the highest strength increment was observed, and 400 ◦c, at which clear thermally-induced rock mass weakening was observed. a specimen at room temperature was used as a control. based on optical microscope imaging, mineralogical assembling in the granite specimen could be identified by the colour and texture of each of the mineral assemblages. further, a detailed sem study was performed using scanning electron imaging (sei) and bsei back-scatter electron imaging (bsei) techniques. bsei images taken at low magnifications clearly show different mineral assemblages and grain boundaries (see ). using energy-dispersive x-ray (edx) technology with aztec oxford instruments, chemical component mapping was generated in each specimen, and each mineral was identified qualitatively. the bright colour images observed in edx images indicate higher concentration (higher energy dispersion) while dark colour areas indicate lower concentration (lower energy dispersion). based on the spectrum of each point (point id), the corresponding mineral was identified and a map spectrum provided overall elements available for each specimen. according to  and 14, there are clear mineralogical assembling in the granite specimens, mainly with quartz, kfeldspar and plagioclase. the heating of granite up to 200 ◦c temperature has not caused any significant thermally-induced micro-cracks (in addition to the pre-existing faults and grain boundaries) and almost all grain boundaries remain intact. however, further heating of granite to the higher temperature of 400 ◦c caused the induction of some micro-cracks, mainly

quartz feldspar boundaries. however, only a few grain\\x0c56 w.g.p.  / geothermics 65 (2017) 44–59 . optical microscopic and sem images of thin sections of strathbogie granite (a) at room temperature; (b) pre-heated to 100 ◦c (c) pre-heated to 400 ◦c. boundaries have been partially parted and a significant number of grain boundaries appear to remain intact up to this temperature. furthermore, based on the edx mapping, it was confirmed that intra-granular cracks are mainly initiated along the feldspar and quartz minerals. intragranular cracks were mainly observed in larger crystals (crystals greater than 0.5 mm) and smaller crystals remained un-parted even at 400 ◦c. for strathbogie granite, thermally-induced intra-granular micro-cracks seem to play a significant role at relatively low temperatures, probably due to the presence of relatively high k feldspar and biotite contents. similar observations have been reported in bauer and johnson’s (1979) study conducted for charcoal granite, where intra-granular microcracks predominantly occur compared to grain boundary cracks. the sem analysis is also consistent with this finding, which exhibits inhibition of micro-crack development followed by micro-cracking at relatively high temperatures. the crack propagation process in any rock mass is largely inﬂuenced by the mineralogical composition, because cracks normally propagate through weaker planes of the rock mass. since granite is an igneous type of rock, two main types of thermallyinduced cracking modes can be identified: inter-granular and intragranular. the amount of inter-granular or intra-granular cracking is dependent on the stress state, rock type and mineralogy of the rock mass. inter-granular cracks occur along grain boundaries, pre-existing faults and micro-cracks of the rock, while intragranular cracks occur through weaker mineralogical constituents (kranz, 1983). for example, k feldspar and biotite are weaker mineralogical constituents due to their large crystals (>10 mm), as crystals greater than 2–3 mm in size are generally defined as weaker mineralogical constituents compared to equi-dimensional small crystals like quartz (homand-etienne and houpert, 1989). based on experimental results, intra-granular cracking is highly temperature-dependent due to the temperature dependent dislocations in the rocks. this is because different mineralogical components have different thermo-elastic moduli and thermal conductivities (kranz, 1983; , 2008). these observations suggest that micro-cracking in granite is highly temperature dependent, as evidenced by the previously observed initial strength gain followed by slight strength reduction with increasing temperature in the tested granite. however, this shows that granite needs to be heated to a sufficient temperature to cause thermal cracks in it and therefore, heating to a lower temperature may only cause a strength gain through the thermal expansion of the rock matrix. this is consistent with the results of bauer and johnson (1979). the mechanical properties of charcoal granite in their study remained relatively steady until 200 ◦c, and westerly granite exhibited a significant thermal dependency, even at relatively low temperatures (<200 ◦c). in homand-etienne and houpert (1989) study, the variation of uni-axial compressive strength of both semones and remiremont granites is insignificant until 400 ◦c, followed by significant reductions at higher temperatures. these results indicate the dependency of mineralogical composition and grain size distribution on the temperature dependent mechanical behaviour in various types of granites. however,\\x0cw.g.p.  / geothermics 65 (2017) 44–59 57 . bse images of strathbogie granite with edx mapping:

different confining pressures (10, 30, 60, 90 mpa) and four different temperatures (rt, 100, 200, 300 ◦c), simulating various geothermal reservoir conditions. the following conclusions can be drawn: mechanical behaviour of the tested granite is inﬂuenced by both reservoir depth and temperature, and the depth effect is much greater than the temperature effect. granite located at relatively smaller depths appears to fail through shear localization and increasing depth may cause this to change to ductile failure through strain hardening. a progressive enhancement in stress threshold with increasing confining pressure is observed in strathbogie granite. such behaviours exhibit greater strength and lower brittle characteristics in granite located at greater depths. increasing of temperature causes granite’s strength to be enhanced up to a certain temperature (around 200 ◦c for strathbogie granite) through the possible thermal expansion of the rock matrix and further increasing of temperature may cause it to weaken by inducing thermal cracks. this was confirmed by the micro-structural analysis, which did not reveal any noticeable amount of thermally-induced micro-cracking in strathbogie granite up to 200 ◦c, and heating of the granite to a greater temperature as 400 ◦c caused many intra-granular cracks in quartz and feldspar and some grain boundary cracks between quartz and feldspar minerals. furthermore, according to ae analysis, increasing the temperature first causes the crack propagation stress threshold to increase and further increasing of the temperature causes it to be slightly reduced. this indicates a suppression of micro-cracks at low temperatures by matrix expansion and the development of micro-cracks through thermally-induced damage at higher temperatures. finally an attempt was made to improve the conventional mohrcoulomb failure criteria for geothermal reservoirs with extreme pressures and temperatures, because the conventional criteria are not applicable to extreme conditions. acknowledgements this research project is funded by the australian research council (arc dp160104223) and the authors would like to

reservoirs. the present study may therefore capture more realistic geothermal reservoir behaviour. 3.6. temperature-dependent failure criteria for strathbogie granite ≤ (3) − is questionable, due to the to date, although many strength criteria are available for intact rock, the practical application of most of them for geothermal reservoirs in-situ model parameters required when considering the available high-pressure and high-temperature environment in underground reservoirs. of the various failure criteria, the mohr-coulomb failure criteria have been extensively used in the field and have made a significant contribution to the determination of rock mass failure. however, they have some major limitations, including ignoring the intermediate stress (cid:2)2 inﬂuence (which has been proven to have a substantial inﬂuence on rock strength) and the assumed linearity (the strength criteria of rock are non-linear in reality). after re-analyzing thousands of reported triaxial experiments and combining the critical state concept proposed by barton (1976),  (2011) proposed a non-linear mohr-coulomb failure criterion. according to the findings of  (2011), the mohr-coulomb shear strength parameters should only be obtained by performing conventional tri-axial tests under low confining stresses (in the linear region of the mohr-coulomb failure envelope). according to their statistical analysis, (cid:2)cc ≈ (cid:2)crit, where (cid:2)c and (cid:2) crit are uni-axial compressive strength and critical confining pressure, respectively. the modified mohr-coulomb failure criterion proposed by  is given below: (cid:2)1 − (cid:2)3 = where, (cid:2)ci ≈ (cid:2)ci + 2sin(cid:3)i0 sin(cid:3)i0 ucs of the rock = 2ciocos(cid:3)i0/1 sin(cid:3)i0, (cid:3)i0 and cio are friction

failure criteria cannot be directly applied to geothermal reservoir rocks at extreme pressures and temperatures, because the strength response is altered by the thermal effect (heuze, 1983). to date, no extensive study has captured this thermal response in the improved mohrcoulomb failure criteria. such a realistic approach is necessary for deep underground engineering applications like geothermal energy extraction. the concepts of barton (1976) and  (2011) are therefore incorporated into the temperature inﬂuence in this study and an attempt is made to propose novel strength criteria for geothermal reservoir rocks based on experimental data: + 2sin(cid:3)i (t) sin(cid:3)i (t) (cid:2)3 − − 1 − (cid:2)3 (t) = 2ci (t) cos(cid:3)i (t) sin(cid:3)i (t) 1 (cid:2)1 − (4) (cid:2)3 ≤

wang, 2014). site selection for china's hlw repository started in 1985 (wang, 2010). the efforts have been focused on potential hlw repository sites located within granite intrusions in mainland china. since 1999, the beijing research ⁎ corresponding author. e-mail address:  (x.g. zhao). http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tecto.2016.06.021 0040-1951/© 2016 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved. institute of uranium geology (briug) has performed site characterization studies in the beishan area, china. so far, the beishan area has been considered as the most potential candidate area for china's hlw repository. among all the engineering properties of crystalline rocks at a potential hlw repository site, the thermal conductivity is one of the most important parameters in design consideration because it has a direct impact on the evaluation of the necessary repository volume and the optimization of the repository layout (sundberg and hellström, 2009). for instance, in the swedish kbs-3 concept for geological disposal of spent fuel, copper canisters with cast iron inserts containing the spent fuel are surrounded by bentonite for isolation and mechanical protection (, 2006). the heat generated by the spent fuel will increase the temperature of all components of the repository. for the bentonite buffer outside the canisters, the peak temperature must not exceed 100 °c. this requirement implies that the canisters cannot be deposited arbitrarily close to each other. on the other hand, unnecessarily large distances between the canisters will mean inefficient and costly use of the repository rock volume (, 2009). to fulfill the temperature requirement, the rocks with low thermal conductivities will\\x0cx.g.  / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137 125 lead to a larger distance between canisters than for a case with high thermal conductivities. this is because the rocks with low thermal conductivities will give rise to higher temperatures in the bentonite (, 2008). hence, to design and construct repositories successfully, it is essential to perform an accurate assessment of the thermal conductivity characteristics of the host rock. over the past few decades, various experimental approaches have been employed to measure the thermal conductivity of rocks. the results indicate that the thermal conductivity of rocks is closely associated with mineral composition, porosity, texture, and density, etc. (birch and clark, 1940; clauser and huenges, 1995; , 2005; , 2004; , 2015; , 2007; , 2009). for crystalline rocks with relatively homogeneous texture and low porosity, the mineral composition dominates the thermal conductivity. in volcanic and sedimentary rocks, the high variability of porosity in these rocks is a major factor controlling the thermal conductivity (clauser and huenges, 1995; , 2004). for example, increasing porosity, which acts as barrier to the ﬂow of heat, often results in both lower p-wave velocity and lower thermal conductivity values (, 2004). for a given rock, water content and temperature have an inﬂuence on its thermal conductivity. generally, the thermal conductivity of the rock increases and decreases with increasing water content (cho and kwon, 2010; , 2009) and temperature (, 2009; birch and clark, 1940; heuze, 1983; , 2014; , 2008; vosteen and schellschmidt, 2003), respectively. moreover, the effect of water saturation on the thermal conductivity of rocks shows a generally increasing trend with increasing porosity (nagaraju and roy, 2014). given that the thermal conductivity of surrounding rocks around the excavations will be changed by the excavation-induced stress, some researchers studied the inﬂuence of pressure on the thermal conductivity of rocks (, 2010; , 2009; , 2004; , 2008; sibbitt, 1976; walsh and decker, 1966; zimmerman, 1989). one of the main findings achieved from these investigations shows that the thermal conductivity varies with the pressure exerted on the rock. with increasing applied pressure, the thermal conductivity starts to increase and subsequently the increase rate tends to be a constant value due to gradual closure of cracks and pores within the rock (, 2008; walsh and decker, 1966). while the above-mentioned studies provide meaningful insight into the thermal conductivity of various rocks, the thermal conductivity characteristics of low-porosity crystalline rocks subjected to different external factors such as water saturation, temperature and compression stress have not been fully understood. on the other hand, the information on the thermal conductivity of rocks in a potential hlw repository site must be known with sufficient confidence to provide necessary input conditions for its long-term safety assessment, which is one of the motivations for this study. in this work, experimental investigations on the thermal conductivity of the beishan granitic rocks are conducted using the transient plane source (tps) method. in the following discussion, rock sampling and basic physical properties of the rock specimens are introduced first. testing facilities and procedures are then described. subsequently, the water saturation, temperature and compression stress dependent thermal conductivity characteristics of the tested rocks are evaluated comprehensively, and finally some insights are obtained. 2. rock sampling and preparation the beishan area is situated in gansu province of northwestern china (see ). after a long geological evolution and weathering process, the topography of this area is characterized by a ﬂat gobi and small gentle rolling hills with elevations ranging between 1400 and 2000 m above the sea level. the crust in this area possesses a blocky structure with many granite intrusions (see ). other surrounding rocks include mainly metamorphic and sedimentary rocks, as well as quaternary cover. rock sampling was carried out in the jijicao and xinchang rock blocks, which are currently considered as two of the key investigation sub-areas during site selection and characterization. . geographical location of the beishan area and a photo showing its typical topography.\\x0c126 x.g.  / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137 xinchang bs06 bs18 bs19 jijicao bs16 bs15 bs05 n 2.5 km granitic rock sedimentary rock metamorphic rock quaternary cover borehole fault . rock sampling from six boreholes in the jijicao and xinchang sub-areas for thermal conductivity measurements. intact drill cores with a diameter of approximately 63 mm were taken from six sub-vertical boreholes (i.e., boreholes bs05, bs06, bs15, bs16, bs18 and bs19) in these two sub-areas. the borehole locations are presented in . field observations indicated that the collected granitic rocks were relatively isotropic in texture and mineralogical composition. to evaluate the geological nature of the rocks, a series of thin sections were prepared and then exposed to cross-polarized light under an optical microscope to identify the dominant minerals in the rocks. the percentages of the dominant minerals were determined by point counting on thin sections. for each thin section approximately 500 points covering phenocrysts and groundmass were counted. according to the quartz-alkali feldspar-plagioclase (qap) diagram (streckeisen, 1976), the rocks can further be classified. it can be observed from  that the rocks contain mainly a moderate to low amount of quartz and alkali feldspar, and a moderate to high amount of plagioclase. this means that the collected rocks dominantly range from granodiorite to monzogranite. for grain size characteristics, the rocks are from fine grained to, medium to coarse grained. an overview of the basic information of the rocks is listed in . based on the borehole no. and sampling depth, these rocks have been divided into eight groups. a total of 47 pairs of rock specimens, 50 mm in diameter, were prepared from the drill cores with a length to diameter ratio of approximately 0.5. in particular, specimen ends were polished carefully using a q 90 90 i granodiorite ii monzogranite 60 60 ii i bs05 bs06 bs15 bs16 bs18-1 bs18-2 bs19-1 bs19-2 20 20 5 5 p 10 35 65 90 a . qap classification of the eight rock groups based on modal analysis. grinding machine until the ﬂatness and roughness of the ends are less than 10 μm and 3 μm, respectively. the ﬂat and polished specimen end surfaces minimize the thermal contact resistance during thermal conductivity measurement. a minimum of ten specimens for each rock group were prepared. 3. test methodology 3.1. an introduction to the used tps method in the fields of geology and geophysics, laboratory approaches to measuring soil and rock thermal conductivity can mainly be divided into two groups: steady state and transient state. in this work, the transient plane source (tps) method (gustafsson, 1991; log and gustafsson, 1995) was utilized to measure the thermal conductivity of the specimens. as one of the transient measurement methods, the tps technique is based on the use of a transiently heated plane sensor (i.e., hot disk sensor) and a hot disk thermal constants analyser (see a). the used hot disk tps2500s system can measure thermal conductivity of materials ranging from 0.01 to 400 w/mk. the hot disk sensor consists of a continuous double spiral, which is etched out of a thin nickel foil (e). this spiral is sandwiched between two sheets of electrical insulation materials made of kapton. the sensor acts both as a heat source for increasing the temperature of the specimens and as a dynamic temperature sensor for recording the temperature increase. during the measurement, the temperature in the sensor rises and heat starts to ﬂow to the specimens. the temperature rise in the sensor provides an indicator of the thermal properties of the specimens. if the specimens have good thermal conducting properties, the heat will be transported rapidly inside the specimens. on the contrary, if the specimens have good thermal insulation properties, the sensor temperature will rise faster and the heat will not be transported as much as in the test of the good thermal conducting specimens. compared with steady state measurement methods such as the divided bar (beck and beck, 1958; birch, 1950; , 1971) and the guarded hot plate (, 2009; , 2012), one of significant advantages of the tps technique is that the thermal conductivity of materials can be measured more quickly, typically from several to tens of seconds. hence, a long wait for thermal gradients to equilibrate is not required and the moisture migration in response to temperature gradients was minimized (jackson and taylor, 1986). on the other hand, unlike some transient methods such as thermal needle probes (barry-, 2013; von herzen and maxwell, 1959), which are commonly used for soils and soft rocks, the tps method can be\\x0cx.g.  / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137 127  basic information and geological description of the tested rocks. rock type and group basic information mineral composition naked eye observation photomicrograph of a thin section monzogranite (bs05) location: jijicao borehole no.: bs05 sampling depth: 5–7 m number of specimen pairs: 7 grain size: medium plagioclase: 33.7% ± 5.8%;

, 2003). hence, the thermal resistance between the specimen ends and the sensor exists (see section 3.2). so far, the tps technology has been widely used to\\x0c128 x.g.  / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137 a c temperature control system b hot disk thermal constants analyser sensor platen specimens d e specimens insulation material chamber sensor specimens oil bath sensor double spiral cable extension . the hot disk tps2500s system (a) used to measure the thermal conductivity of specimens under room temperature (d), high temperature (c), and uniaxial compression (b) conditions. a hot disk sensor showing its key components (e). determine the thermal properties of different materials (, 2015; , 2008; urquhart and bauer, 2015; , 2014; , 2012). 3.2. theory of the tps technique to theoretically describe how the tps method behaves, the thermal conductivity equation can be solved assuming that the hot disk sensor consists of a certain number of concentric ring heat sources located in an infinitely large sample (hot disk, 2007). a constant electric power supplied to the sensor results in an increase in temperature which is directly related to the variation in the sensor resistance (r(t)) by the equation: \\x10 \\x11 r tð þ ¼ r0 1 þ αδt τð þ ð1þ where r0 is the nickel electrical resistance in the beginning of the recording, α is the temperature coefficient of resistance of the nickel foil, and δtðτþ is the mean value of temperature rise in the sensor due to a constant current pulse given by: \\x10 δt τð þ ¼ p0 π3=2ak \\x11−1d τð þ ð2þ where p0 is the total output of power from the sensor, a is the sensor radius, k is the thermal conductivity of the sample that is being tested and d(τ) is a dimensionless time dependent function with: τ ¼ t=θð ð3þ þ1=2; θ ¼ a2=d where t is the time measured from the start of the transient recording, θ is the characteristic time, which depends both on parameters of the sensor and the sample, and d is the thermal diffusivity of the sample. according to eq. (2), and δtðτþ and d(τ) plotted as a function of τ provides a linear relationship with a slope that is a function of p0, a, and k. thermal conductivity k can be obtained by fitting the experimental data to the straight line given by eq. (2); thermal diffusivity d is calculated from eq. (3) taking into account the τ value determined in the previous fit. as mentioned above, the solution of the thermal conductivity equation is based on the assumption that the hot disk sensor is located in an infinite material in perfect contact with the sensor surface. this means that the heat ﬂow generated from each measurement must not reach the outside boundaries of the specimen (hot disk, 2007). meanwhile, a careful preparation of specimen ends is required to minimize thermal contact resistance. an estimation of how far the heat ﬂow has proceeded in the specimen during a recording is the probing depth δp, which is defined as (hot disk, 2007): ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ p dt δp ¼ 2 ð4þ to determine the thermal conductivity with good accuracy, the shortest distance from any part of the sensor to the nearest outside boundary of the sample should be larger than δp. in our experiments, the used hot disk sensor has a radius of 6.403 mm. the shortest distance is about 19 mm, and the probing depth is approximately 10 mm. for this probing depth value, we can consider that we are conducting a bulk measurement. 3.3. test procedures 3.3.1. tests on specimens under saturated and dry conditions firstly, the specimens were immersed by deionized water in a vacuum for a period of 96 h. the specimens were then taken from the vacuum and the water droplets on the surfaces were wiped dry, care being taken to ensure that no rock grains or fragments were lost. the mass of the water-saturated specimens (msat) was measured using a\\x0cx.g.  / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137 129 loading measurement 60 50

precision balance (to 0.0001 g). our tests revealed that the mass of the specimens could be approximately constant under vacuum within 72 h (see ), indicating that the specimens were saturated with water. subsequently, the hot disk sensor was horizontally placed between the two saturated specimen pieces with the double spiral centered and totally covered, and the two specimen pieces were firmly clamped together to ensure that there was no air gap between the sensor and the specimen end surfaces, as presented in d. in order to remain water saturation, the saturated specimens and the sensor were kept in a plastic bag during thermal conductivity measurement (adl-zarrabi, 2004). after the test, the used water-saturated specimens were suffered from dehydration treatment in a thermostatic drying oven at 105 °c for a period of 24 h and subsequently cooled in a desiccator to measure the thermal conductivity under a dry condition. meanwhile, the mass of the dry specimens (mdry) was measured, and the porosity (n) of the specimens was calculated using the equations n ¼ 100v p v % v p ¼ msat − mdry ρw ð5þ ð6þ where v is the bulk rock volume, vp is the pore volume, and ρw is the density of water. for each pair of specimens saturated or dried, measurements on the thermal conductivity were carried out at room temperature (25 ± 1 °c). 3.3.2. tests on specimens under increasing temperature to investigate the effect of temperature on the thermal conductivity of the tested rocks, measurements were performed on dry specimens from 40 °c to 150 °c based on the requirements of the used test equipment. compared with measurements at room temperature, the experiments under high temperature are time consuming due to a slow stepwise heating process by using a constant temperature oil bath and a temperature control system, as shown in c. the thermal conductivity measurement can only be conducted until the two specimen pieces in the chamber with a specimen holder within the oil bath have reached thermal equilibrium and kept a target temperature value. during thermal equilibrium of the oil bath, the hot disk sensor monitors continuously the temperature variation of the specimens. for our tests, the thermal conductivity of the specimens was measured when the recorded temperature variation of the specimens is less than 0.04 °c. in general, 32 h were needed to complete

measurement, the load was maintained constant for a period of about 15 min to avoid residual temperature drifts on the specimens. based on the in-situ stress measurement results obtained from the beishan area (, 2013), the maximum axial compression stress applied to the specimens was set to be 45 mpa to approximately simulate the excavation-induced stress near the vertical hlw disposal element boundary at a depth of 600 m. the axial stress applied to the specimens was recorded automatically, and the used stress path throughout the course of testing is presented in . the experiments were conducted at room temperature. according to previous experimental results (, 2015a; , 2015b), the identified crack initiation stresses of cylindrical specimens of beishan granitic rocks under uniaxial compression using the cumulative ae hit (caeh) method range from 45.3 to 109.1 mpa, which are larger than the maximum compression stress adopted in the present study. hence, the stress-induced rock damage might not occur in the tested specimens during loading. it should be mentioned that in the process of loading, the friction may occur at the interfaces between the specimen ends and the sensor. due to limitation of the tps measurement technique, the utilized test method does not consider the potential inﬂuence of interface friction effect on the experimental results. to reduce or eliminate the friction effect, further efforts are needed to produce innovative design for the test equipment. although not perfect, the developed test system provides a feasible means for us to gain insight into thermal conductivity behaviors of rocks under compression. 4. test results 4.1. inﬂuence of water saturation on the thermal conductivity  porosity, thermal conductivity and effect of water

about how the gradual heating and the thermal equilibrium processes would affect the water content of the specimens, leading to difficulties in evaluating the relationship between the thermal conductivity and the water saturation degree of the specimens quantitatively. 3.3.3. tests on specimens under uniaxial compression the uniaxial compression tests on dry specimens were conducted using a hydraulic servo-controlled compression machine. for each test, two specimen pieces with the hot disk sensor were contained between steel platens machined to match their end surfaces, as shown in b. the interfaces between the specimens and the steel platens were daubed with a thin layer of lubricant to reduce the end effect of the platens during loading. when the experimental setup was completed, axial-load control was used with a loading rate of 100 n/s and the axial load was increased with an increment thermal conductivity measurements were carried out on the 40 pairs of specimens both in dry and water-saturated conditions, and the results are listed in . a statistical analysis shows that for the eight rock groups under dry or saturated state, the standard deviation (sd) and coefficient of variation (cov) of the thermal conductivity are all less than 0.06 w/mk and 4%, respectively, indicating that the results between specimens in each rock group have a good consistency. for all rock groups, the average thermal conductivity values in the dry state (kdry) range between 2.412 and 2.812 w/mk. the values under watersaturated condition (ksat) for the same set of specimens

higher thermal conductivity (0.604 w/mk) replaced the air with a lower thermal conductivity (0.025 w/mk) in the void of the rocks, leading to an increase of the thermal conductivity. for our data set,

is seen that the thermal conductivity of the specimens shows a decaying trend with increasing temperature, and the values at 150 °c range from 5.7% to 8.7% lower than those at room temperature. this means that within the used temperature range, the inﬂuence of the increasing temperature on the decay of thermal conductivity for these rocks is limited. on the other hand, a possible reason for the gradual decrease in thermal conductivity is the generation of thermally induced microcracks in the rocks because of a mismatch between thermal expansion coefficients of adjacent mineral grains in a homogeneous temperature field (, 1993), which has been demonstrated from a microcracking perspective based on numerical simulations (zhao, 2016). based on the experimental data, the relationship between thermal conductivity and temperature can be described using the equation: k ¼ kr − at2 ð8þ where kr is the thermal conductivity of the rock at room temperature (25 °c), t is the temperature in celsius, and a is the fit coefficient (see ). the parameter a affects the decaying velocity of the thermal conductivity with the temperature, i.e., the decaying velocity of the thermal conductivity increases as a increases. as shown in , a in eq.

clauser, 2009) have been proposed. comprehensive overviews and case studies on such mixing models can be found in (, 2009; clauser, 2009; , 2013; hartmann, 2005; , 2015). based on the experimental data (see ) in combination with the methodology used by  (2013), the abovementioned mixing models were used to predict the thermal conductivity values of the tested rocks in the water-saturated state.  shows the comparison between measured and calculated thermal conductivities for the four different models. it can be observed from a, b, and d that the geometric mean, the arithmetic mean, and the effectivemedium mean yield similar prediction results and consistently underestimate the thermal conductivity of the eight rock groups, especially for the groups with relatively high porosity values (e.g., groups bs05 and bs15). the hashin–shtrikman mean shows a reasonably good fit for all rock groups, as shown in c. the analysis results are basically in line with observations reported by  (2013) because most of the evaluated mixing models used in their analysis also underestimate the thermal conductivity of the rocks. however, the geometric mean model was rated as the best fit to their data set. it should be noted that the rocks used in their analysis covered different rock types with a large range in porosity, from almost zero to about 30%. in addition, the measured thermal conductivity values of these rocks spans the interval between 1.0 and 6.5 w/mk. the present investigations focused mainly on the granitic rocks with low porosities and a narrow thermal conductivity range. hence, the large difference of rock properties may result in uncertainties between analysis results obtained from various mixing models. more work is required to explain this discrepancy. nagaraju and roy (2014) defined the effect of water saturation on thermal conductivity (s) as a function of porosity of rocks, and s is expressed by s ¼ ksat − kdry ð7þ kdry according to the measurement results listed in , we established the relationship between s and the porosity of the rocks, as presented in . analysis of  reveals that the effect of water saturation on thermal conductivity of rocks presents an increasing trend with an increase of porosity. a linear form expression can fit the data reasonably well while ensuring that the line passes through the origin. 4.2. inﬂuence of temperature on the thermal conductivity  presents the variation of thermal conductivity of seven pairs of dry specimens in different rock groups with temperature from 40 °c  fit coefficient a for thermal conductivity-temperature curves of seven pairs of specimens in different rock groups. rock type and specimen no. monzogranite (bs05-07) granodiorite (bs06-05) monzogranite (bs15-07) granodiorite (bs16-05) monzogranite (bs18-1-08) granodiorite (bs18-2-05) monzogranite (bs19-1-07) a (10−6) 8.821 5.679 8.394 4.871 6.891 5.728 6.385 r2 0.9830 0.9334 0.9853 0.9289 0.9262 0.9581 0.9933 132 x.g.  / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137\\x0cx.g.  / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137 133 n=2 20 10 axial stress (mpa) 30 40 n=3 20 10 axial stress (mpa) 30 40 50 50 3.4 3.3 3.2 3.1 3.0 2.9 2.8 2.7 2.6 2.5 2.4 c thermal conductivity (w/mk) 50 0 f 2.9 2.8 2.7 2.6 2.5 2.4 thermal conductivity (w/mk) 50 0 n=3 20 10 axial stress (mpa) 30 40 n=3 20 10 axial stress (mpa) 30 40 bs05 bs06 bs15 bs16 bs18-1 bs18-2 bs19-1 bs19-2 y=24.15-24.99e-x (r2=0.9296) 21 18 15 12 0369 i r(%) n=1 20 10 axial stress (mpa) 30 40 50 0.0 0.3 0.9 1.2 0.6 porosity (%) 1.5 1.8 b 3.0 2.9 2.8 2.7 2.6 2.5 2.4 thermal conductivity (w/mk) 50 0 3.2e 3.1 3.0 2.9 2.8 2.7 2.6 2.5 2.4 thermal conductivity (w/mk) 50 0 3.2h 3.1 3.0 2.9 2.8 2.7 2.6 thermal conductivity (w/mk) 50 0 n=3 20 10 axial stress (mpa) 30 40 n=3 20 10 axial stress (mpa) 30 40 n=2 20 10 axial stress (mpa) 30 40 3.0 2.9 2.8 2.7 2.6 2.5 2.4 2.3 2.2 a thermal conductivity (w/mk) 3.0d 2.9 2.8 2.7 2.6 2.5 2.4 2.3 2.2 2.1 2.0 thermal conductivity (w/mk) 3.0g 2.9 2.8 2.7 2.6 2.5 2.4 thermal conductivity (w/mk) 0 0 0 . inﬂuence of axial compression stress on the thermal conductivity of the eight rock groups: (a) bs05, (b) bs06, (c) bs15, (d) bs16, (e) bs18-1, (f) bs18-2, (g) bs19-1 and (h) bs19-2, and variation of the increase rate of the thermal conductivity (r) with rock porosity (i). error bars indicate the standard deviation of the thermal conductivity. n in the figures represents the number of specimen pairs in each rock group. we attempted to relate a with other rock parameters and found that a depended on the magnitude of rock porosity (n), as presented in . the coefficient a varies with porosity n according to the following equation: a ¼ 9:43 − 0:71=n2 ð9þ according to eqs.

(11) is not sensitive to the variation of rock porosity, and is within the range from 0.20 to 0.27 except for the rock group bs19-1. for simplicity, an average value of c = 0.24 obtained from  is used to approximately describe the trend, as shown in b. using eqs. (11)–(12) and the constant coefficient c, an overall fit is made for these rock groups to reproduce the rock porosity-dependent thermal conductivity under different axial stresses. a comparison between individual and overall fit results is presented in . it is found that for each rock group subjected to different compression stresses, the difference of the thermal conductivity values from the individual and overall fits is less than 0.05 w/mk. the good agreement indicates that the established rock porosity-dependent model can capture the nonlinear stress-thermal conductivity relationships of the beishan granitic rocks satisfactorily. 5. discussion one of the findings from the experimental investigations in the previous sections is that the rock porosity has an inﬂuence on the thermal conductivity of the beishan granitic rocks under water saturation, increasing temperature and compression stress conditions, although the porosity of tested rocks is relatively low. it is well known that for low-porosity crystalline rocks, the mineral composition plays an important role in dominating the thermal conductivity. the crystalline rocks are mainly made up of quartz, feldspars, and mafic minerals such as pyroxene, amphibole and biotite, and the content of minerals from these three mineral groups basically determines a rock's thermal conductivity (clauser and huenges, 1995). as mentioned in section 2, a model analysis on a total of 46 thin sections of the rocks was conducted to identify the dominant minerals in the rocks. as listed in , the main minerals of these rocks include quartz, plagioclase, k-feldspar and biotite. among these four minerals, quartz has the highest thermal conductivity (7.69 w/mk) while another three minerals have a thermal conductivity range between 1.70 and 2.29 w/mk (horai, 1971). hence, when the porosity values of the specimens in different rock groups are close to each other, quartz content in the rocks may determine the thermal conductivity. according to the data listed in , a presents the inﬂuence of quartz content on the average thermal conductivity of different rock groups in dry state. it is seen that except for rock groups bs05 and bs15 (which have relatively large porosity values of 1.37% and 0.68%, respectively), thermal conductivity of the rocks appears an increasing trend with increasing quartz content. when the specimens are subjected to compression stresses, the original pores and cracks in the rocks tend to close, and the effective contact areas between mineral grains increase, leading to a significant decay of the porosity effect on the thermal conductivity, especially for rocks with relatively high porosity. on the other hand, the closure of pores and cracks increases the contact opportunity of quartz grains, and hence improves the transportation capability of heat ﬂow in the rocks. under this condition, an obvious increase of the thermal conductivity for all rock groups with increasing quartz content can be observed, as presented in b. 6. conclusions beishan granitic rocks are candidate host rock types for china's hlw repository. in this paper, thermal conductivity characteristics of the beishan granitic rocks have been investigated using the transient plane source (tps) method. the measurement results indicate that for the used eight rock groups with a porosity range from 0.40% to 1.37%, the average thermal conductivity values in the dry state range between 2.412 and 2.812 w/mk. the values under water-saturated condition range from 2.602 to 3.156 w/mk. meanwhile, the effect of water saturation on thermal conductivity presents an increasing trend with an increase of rock porosity. using several mixing models proposed by previous researchers, we found that the hashin–shtrikman mean model showed a reasonably good fit to the experimental data while another three models currently obtained data, a best fitting equation of axial stressdependent thermal conductivity for these rocks can be expressed as (, 2004) k ¼ k0 þ bσ c ð11þ 1 where k0 is the thermal conductivity of the rock at zero stress, σ1 is the axial stress, and b and c are fit coefficients, as listed in . analysis of eq. (11) reveals that the coefficient b plays a critical role in controlling the increasing gradient of the thermal conductivity in the initial loading stage (i.e., crack closure stage). the coefficient c dominantly affects the increasing velocity of the thermal conductivity in the subsequent elastic deformation stage. based on experimental investigations on the thermal conductivity of some rocks subjected to uniaxial stresses using a steady-state apparatus developed by  (2004),  (2008) found that the parameters b and c depended on the magnitude of elastic modulus of the rocks, and subsequently established an elastic modulus dependent model to predict the thermal conductivity values under pressure. unfortunately, in the present study, the elastic moduli of the tested rocks have not been available. therefore, the model proposed by  (2008) cannot be used to fit our test results. according to , we found that the increasing gradients of the thermal conductivities in the initial loading stage were generally large for the rocks with a high porosity such as rock groups bs05 and bs15. hence, the coefficient b is associated with the rock porosity n, i.e., b increases as n increases, as presented in a. an exponential form expression can fit the data reasonably, as follows: b ¼ 0:25 − 0:24 exp −nð þ ð12þ bs05 bs06 bs15 bs16 bs18-1 bs18-2 bs19-1 bs19-2 20 22 24 26 28 30

thermal conductivity of the rocks under the water-saturated condition. future work is demanded to verify the validity of various mixing models using different rock types with a large porosity range. with increasing temperature from 25 °c to 150 °c, the thermal conductivity of the rocks shows a decaying trend and the values at 150 °c range from 5.7% to 8.7% lower than those at room temperature, revealing that the inﬂuence of temperature on the thermal conductivity of the tested rocks is limited. in addition, the thermal conductivity of the rocks increases with increasing compression stress in a nonlinear behavior, and the increase rate of the thermal conductivity increases with an increase of rock porosity. it is found that the effects of compression stress and water saturation on the magnitude of thermal conductivity of the rocks are basically comparable. based on the experimental data, the empirical models considering the inﬂuence of rock porosity have been established for predicting the temperature and compression stress dependent thermal conductivity characteristics of the rocks, and the predictions are found to be in good agreement with experimental results. this study thus emphasizes importance of porosity on thermal conductivity measurements even for low porosity crystalline rocks. when the pores and cracks in the rocks tend to close during compression, quartz content may determine the thermal conductivity, and there exists an increase of the thermal conductivity with increasing quartz content. this is because the closure of pores and cracks increases the contact opportunity of quartz grains, and hence improves the transportation capability of heat ﬂow in the rocks. while the test results provide insights into the thermal conductivity characteristics of beishan granitic rocks, one should be aware of the limitation of this study. because the thermal conductivity of granitic rocks is inﬂuenced by many factors. in order to better understand the thermal conductivity of granitic rocks related to rock characteristics such as rock fabric, grain shape, grain contact and grain size, comprehensive petrographic investigations are recommended in the future. in the meantime, studies should be carried out to understand how the interactions between mineral components affect the thermal conductivity. work is also being conducted to investigate the thermal conductivity of the rocks under coupled thermal-hydro-mechanical conditions. acknowledgments this work has been supported by the china atomic energy authority through the

field: a blind fault captured by thermal–hydraulic simulation maren brehme1 guido bloecher1 mauro cacace1 yustin kamah2 martin sauter3 gue nter zimmermann1 received: 24 november 2015 / accepted: 4 july 2016 / published online: 19 july 2016 ó springer-verlag berlin heidelberg 2016 abstract subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow of reservoirs in active tectonic regions is mainly controlled by permeability of fault zones. therefore, the characterization of fault zones is an important step toward performance assessment of a reservoir. the ﬂuid ﬂow is controlled also by pressure and temperature conditions. in this context, we simulated pressure and temperature fields to elaborate on the inﬂuence of permeability on subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow in the lahendong geothermal reservoir. thermal–hydraulic simulation is performed using a finite element approach. adjusting the permeability through 370 different cases, modeling results converged to the observed data within a misfit range of 0–7 %. the best fitting models identified a deep-seated fault that has previously not been traced at the surface. simulated temperature distribution suggests a prominent convective heat ﬂow, driven by an upward migrating and sw–ne oriented ﬂuid ﬂow. this hydraulic gradient causes a pressure drop along the reservoir. highpressure patterns are used to constrain recharge areas, in addition to infiltration measurements. discharge ﬂow occurs from sw to ne migrating also upward toward the hot springs. in that frame, thermal–hydraulic simulations identified previously unresolved subsurface faults, which & maren brehme

keywords permeable faults \\x01 hydrogeology \\x01 fluid ﬂow \\x01 geothermal field management \\x01 reservoir engineering \\x01 pressure drop introduction it geothermal energy is an essential component to supply future energy demands. requires developing new geothermal sites and improving the performance of existing systems to satisfy continuously growing demand. the productivity of a geothermal field mainly depends on subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow, which in active tectonic regions is controlled by permeability of fault zones (moeck 2014). in that frame, the primary focus is on locating and characterizing faulted areas in geothermal fields. this study employs numerical modeling to allocate and quantify permeability anisotropies and discontinuities, e.g., faults, in order to understand their inﬂuence on subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow in geothermal reservoirs. numerical models have been increasingly used to understand the setup and productivity of geothermal systems. a general overview of geothermal models has been given by o’ (2001). additionally, there are several sites exemplifying similar characteristics as in lahendong. the underground movement of hot and cold ﬂuids has been modeled for geothermal fields in new zealand ( 2014). the kakkonda geothermal site, e.g., consists of two reservoirs at various depths with different ﬂuid properties. there, results from ﬂuid ﬂow analysis show the importance of fractures for ﬂuid transport enhancing the recharge or discharge in the reservoir 123\\x0c1088 page 2 of 11 environ earth sci (2016) 75:1088 ( 1995). generally, faults acting as preferential ﬂuid path ways significantly change the pressure and temperature field in the reservoir ( 2013). models for the seferihisar–balc¸ova field focus on the ﬂuid ﬂow inside of faults. results show an enhanced upward heat transport through ﬂuids from bottom of the geothermal system ( 2011). our test ground is the lahendong geothermal field located in sulawesi, indonesia. the field is owned and operated by p.t. pertamina geothermal energy and hosts a power plant with a production capacity of 80 mwe. there, geothermal exploration started in the early 1970s including geophysical and geohydrochemical approaches. it is a water-dominated magmatic structurally controlled system. faults generally act as across-fault ﬂuid barriers and alongfault ﬂuid conductors ( 2014). as a result, hot springs mainly appear on the top of vertically permeable faults at the surface. available numerous drilling and surface measurements allowed a detailed characterization of the geological and hydrogeological setting of the area (;  2011, 2013, 2014, 2016;  2013). the model presented here is developed for investigating subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow and the permeability distribution including the fault zones in the lahendong geothermal field. below, the geological structure of the field is presented followed by an introduction to the modeling approach. detailed investigation of subsurface permeability distribution is a crucial step for site selection and smart drilling strategies. the numerical simulations presented will provide insight into understanding the subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow considering the hydraulic conductivity of faults. it ensures productive as well as sustainable operation of geothermal fields avoiding risks, such as drilling into non-fractured or cold zones, and targeting highly corroding waters. although the target area is lahendong, the general workﬂow is applicable for other geothermal sites consisting of similar constraints. reservoir characterization hydrogeology the overall driving force for the ﬂuid ﬂow is the sw–ne oriented natural hydraulic gradient in the lahendong geothermal system. the direction of ﬂuid ﬂow varies through the geothermal site due to horizontal partitioning of the reservoir by relatively less permeable fault zones ( 2014). the basic sections are located in the  topographic map of the study area with geological features, water and rock sample locations, and model cross section 123\\x0cenviron earth sci (2016) 75:1088 page 3 of 11 1088 south, in the east, and beneath lake linau. beneath lake linau, the direction of ﬂuid ﬂow is slightly rotated to wsw–ene (). also, types of ﬂuid change from one section to another, e.g., an acidic highly saline-type beneath lake linau and a neutral low saline-type south and east of lake linau (). the impermeable structure across faults prevent the ﬂuids from diluting each other ( 2016). however, faults are rather permeable along the vertical axis, which allows recharge of the system through the faults. rainwater infiltrates at a fault in the sw, at mt. lengkoan, and creek water infiltrates into the normal faults at lake linau (). the hydrothermal system discharges into lake linau and toward the ne, as driven by the hydraulic gradient ( 2014). the fracture network along the area is characterized by strike slip faults and normal faults. the sinistral faults strike n 40° and steeply dip toward the se. left step over on the strike slip faults forms an extension basin in the central study area. normal faults at the extension basin strike nw and dip 70°–80° beneath lake linau ( 2014). lithology lahendong area is mainly characterized by pre-, postand tondano formation of plioto pleistocene age ( 2010). the rocks are typically andesite, volcanic breccia, and tuff. those types have been sampled from borehole cores and used to determine porosity, permeability, and thermal conductivity. effective porosity and matrix permeability have been analyzed using a cylindrical-shaped specimen with a dimension of 5 cm x 5 cm 9 2.5 cm oriented parallel to the coring ( 2016). thermal conductivity has been measured on plain sections of dried cores. the experimental setup consists of a gas permeameter for determining matrix permeability ( 2011), of an helium pycnometry for effective porosity measurements (johnson- 1994) and of an optical scanner for thermal conductivity measurements ( 1999). these parameters have been measured and averaged for the three rock types ( 2016; ). andesite has an effective porosity of 3.7 %, a permeability of 2.1 9 10-14 m2, and a thermal conductivity of 1.8 w m-1 k-1 (dry) or 2.2 w m-1 k-1 (saturated). tuff has a porosity of 7.7 % but the lowest permeability of 2.0 9 10-15 m2 of 1.6 w m-1 k-1 (saturated). volcanic breccia is a permeable layer with an effective porosity of 10.5 %, a permeability of 2.3 9 10-14 m2, and a thermal conductivity of 1.6 w m-1 k-1 (dry) or 2.5 w m-1 k-1 (saturated). reservoir

transport in saturated porous media are derived from conservation principles of linear momentum, mass, and energy (dhi-wasy 2009). details on the software and the parameterization can be found in diersch (2014). the model geometry is a 2d vertical sw–ne trending cross section extending 6 km in horizontal and 3 km in vertical direction. the direction of the profile has been selected to cover all relevant processes in the lahendong geothermal field: it cuts major faults and the production and injection wells, which are used for temperature and pressure calibration. furthermore, to the groundwater ﬂow direction, showing major ﬂuid ﬂow activities. the homogeneous and isotropic geological layers in the model are stratified nearly horizontally. faults in the middle of the model, striking perpendicular to the cross section, dip with 84° toward a cooling pluton beneath lake linau. details on structural and geological components of the modeled region have been presented in  (2014). is parallel it the numerical the mesh used for simulation in feflow consists of 45,264 nodes and 89,320 elements that are denser surrounding the faults because of expected gradients due to parameter contrasts. material properties of 123 elements are permeability, porosity, and thermal conductivity and set according to laboratory measurements (). however, properties of the faults and lake linau are slightly adapted to specific conditions. the definitions for the modeled grids along the faults are as follows: porosity is 30 % and thermal conductivity is 1.8 w m-1 k-1. corresponding grids for lake linau are defined by a porosity of 100 % and a thermal conductivity of 0.6 w m-1 k-1. the model simulates ﬂuid ﬂow and thermal transport in saturated media in steady state. initial values and boundary conditions fluid ﬂow boundary conditions in the model describe groundwater heads and recharge amounts (; ). the hydraulic head at the sw model boundary is 837 m and 500 m at the ne boundary. the sw hydraulic head represents infiltration of surface water into a fault, striking perpendicular to the model. hydraulic head at the ne border is adapted to borehole measurements in that area ( 2014). infiltration into the fault zones at lake linau is described by ﬂuid ﬂux boundary conditions. the quantity is 3.0 9 10-4 m s-1 the sw and 1.3 9 10-6 m s-1 at the ne fault distributed over 40 m fault width. groundwater recharge is set to 412 mm a-1 at the ne top surface (; ). fluid movement in for\\x0cthe model domain is constrained by no-ﬂow boundary at the bottom, recharge through the surrounding fault zones, and the low hydraulic heads in the ne model area. discharge of the system in the central study area is mainly toward lake linau and across the ne model boundary. initial hydraulic head for the whole model domain is 500 m. the heat is 116 °c km-1 at transport boundary conditions are time-invariant, fixed temperatures, and heat ﬂux (; ). thermal gradient the sw model boundary, and the temperature is constant 350 °c at the pluton. temperature of water infiltrating into faults and here mixing with shallow warm groundwater is 70 °c, while surface groundwater recharge is at 28 °c. temperature values are obtained from field and bore log measurements ( 2014). heat ﬂux is set to 100 mw m-2 at the bottom model boundary (; ). this value is fixed based on the studies from  (1998), nagao and uyeda (1995), and  (1998). initial temperature for the model domain is set as 116 °c km-1, according to the local thermal gradient. permeability determination initial values for permeability are defined based on laboratory measurements (). after each simulation run, modeled and measured temperature and pressure values have been compared at indicated observation points. in case of poor matching (errors [10 %), permeability has been adjusted until satisfactory results have been achieved. beneath lake linau, simulation results showed locally strong discrepancies between modeled and measured pressure and temperature (errors [45 %). adjustment of permeability in geological infiltration rates into faults, or hydraulic heads did not lead to acceptable results. only the implementation of strong permeability anisotropy throughout whole depth, i.e., an additional fault, resulted in minimization of errors (0–7 %). implementation has been accomplished by mesh adaptation to ensure appropriate behavior around the fault. by this procedure, permeability anisotropies have been located and characterized in detail throughout the model. layers, in general, defining a direction-dependent permeability improves the data fit rather than using similar permeabilities in all directions. this is probably due to the fractures increasing the permeability mostly in vertical direction. porosity and thermal conductivity remained constant throughout simulation. variation in porosity is negligible because it would directly be reﬂected in permeability, while thermal conductivity differences would only affect conductive heat transport, which is not dominant in the lahendong area ( 1998;  2014). 123 100c measurementa 500borelog ofmodel

to obtain the best fit to the measured data changing the absolute and relative permeability in geological elements. relative permeability refers to different permeabilities in horizontal and vertical direction. as a main result, a blind fault has been recognized beneath lake linau, which has not been known from former studies. simulated pressure and temperature are measured at five selected observation points, which represent boreholes with available bore logs for pressure and temperature. details on data are given in . the model with best data fit, out of 370 different models, is considered to generate the final model developed for lahendong. permeability distribution and identification of a blind fault distribution of permeability patterns in the reservoir has been conceived comparing temperature and pressure data in several wells. especially beneath lake linau, closely located wells show high variations in temperature and pressure. a drop of 100 °c and 18 bar along 300 m distance has been observed between well lhd 24 and lhd 28. models first showed high discrepancies between modeled and measured values in this area. however, after implementing another high anisotropic permeable structure between the observation points, models resulted in satisfactory results. the structure has ten times higher vertical environ earth sci (2016) 75:1088 permeability than horizontal permeability. this structure is assumed to be another fault zone located between two known faults with vertical dip and nw strike. this fault shows no trace at surface, because it is covered by lake linau. generally, modeled permeability distribution in the lahendong reservoir is direction-dependent and overprints the lithology. modeled permeability is generally higher than measured ones in the order of up to four magnitudes. this is due to fracture patterns, which are not detectable at core-sample scale. permeability patterns directly affect subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow and temperature and pressure distribution. permeability in the faulted zones and surroundings is lowest in the study area. especially the middle and ne fault, the shallow area beneath sw lake linau and the deep ne section of the ne fault show low permeabilities between 10-13 and 10-14 m2 (). the area between the middle and ne fault, the deep section ne of the sw fault, the sw fault itself and the whole model area toward the sw and ne boundary show higher permeabilities of 10-10 and 10-12 m2 (). permeability varies not only within the modeled area, but also in vertical and horizontal direction. in faults and the deep reservoir section in the ne, permeability is by a factor of 10 higher in the vertical direction than in the horizontal direction (). in the areas between faults, permeability is in some parts by a factor of 10–100 lower in the vertical direction. in the rest of the model, vertical and horizontal permeability do not differ ().  final adapted permeability and anisotropy distribution throughout

some wells existing in this region are of artesian-type. overpressure releases through high permeable zones beneath lake linau and discharges toward surface. the pressure drop is up to 20 bars across the faults (). temperature distribution temperature distribution along the lahendong geothermal reservoir suggests that convective heat transport is the dominating process in the reservoir rocks. isotherms generally follow the sw–ne oriented ﬂow pattern, the rise and the infiltration of ﬂuids. upwelling of isotherms between the faults verifies water rise toward lake linau. infiltration of cold water causes down welling of isotherms particularly on the northeast section of the model. temperature is locally increased at the bottom of the model surrounding the pluton (). subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow the absolute and horizontal/vertical permeability distribution controls local ﬂuid ﬂow in the lahendong reservoir. the general ﬂuid ﬂow, driven by the natural pressure gradient, is oriented from sw to ne. vertical infiltration occurs at faults at lake linau and at the sw boundary. discharge is across the ne model boundary (). the more detailed ﬂow patterns can be observed with streamlines, which show a ﬂuid ﬂow along highly permeable areas. calculated streamlines describe particle ﬂow within the model domain. a forward calculation shows how infiltrating water at the sw model boundary distributes through the reservoir. the backward calculation shows the source of ﬂuid particles arriving at the ne model boundary (). patterns show that hot groundwater ﬂows toward the faults beneath lake linau, where the ﬂuid ﬂow is disturbed by a rise in temperature and vertically high permeable layers. this causes a rise of groundwater in this model area (red forward streamlines in ). at the same time, cold water infiltrates into high permeable areas and distributes over the ne model domain (blue backward streamlines in ). it is clearly seen that the composition of the ne reservoir domain is dominated by coldwater infiltration into faults, while the production areas are characterized by hot water ﬂow (). discussion investigation of subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow in geothermal reservoirs is crucial for sustainable exploitation avoiding drilling into less productive areas. subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow might be locally inﬂuenced by fault zones or physical 123\\x0c1088 page 8 of 11 environ earth sci

infiltrating cold water ﬂowing towards ne model boundary properties of water (i.e. viscosity). the inﬂuence of these parameters on the ﬂuid ﬂow has been investigated in lahendong geothermal reservoir using hydraulic–thermal simulations. simulation results show the detailed permeability distribution in the reservoir including location of an additional fault zone. matching of measured and simulated temperature and pressure has been used as a tool for resolving the permeability distribution. temperature and pressure have been iteratively determined at several observation points (). generally, modeled values are in good agreement with observed ones (). nevertheless, some observation points give slightly different values for both pressure and temperature (lhd 4 and lhd 7) or only temperature (lhd 24). this is probably due to the complicated ﬂow processes or strong small-scale structural variation in fractured and faulted areas. furthermore, density variations, which could have not been included into simulation due to high temperatures, could cause variation of ﬂuid pressure. however, the average deviation of simulated pressure and temperature is 1 %. implemented model parameters are porosity, permeability, and heat conductivity. from those parameters, only permeability has been tested in a specific range during simulation. the inﬂuence of porosity and heat conductivity on ﬂuid ﬂow is negligible due to dominating convective heat ﬂow ( 1998). values implemented in the model are based on measured permeabilities, which represent matrix permeability of rocks. the measured matrix permeability, representing permeability in horizontal direction, is 1.5 9 10-14 m2 on 123 average, which remains within typical permeability range for fractured igneous rocks (schoen 2004). permeability for volcanic breccias ranges typically between 3 9 10-15 and 5 9 10-12 m2 and tuff permeabilities range between 7 9 10-17 and 7 9 10-12 m2 (klavetter and peters 1987). in the wairakei geothermal field, simulating the impermeable layers resulted in permeabilities of 10-18 and 10-14 m2, in horizontal and vertical axis, respectively (mercer and faust 1979). however, permeability in reservoir rocks might be locally increased due to fracture formation. it might also be decreased due to alteration and sealing in faults. in lahendong, modeled permeability can be up to four magnitudes higher than measured ones in faulted areas. this is caused by fractures, which are not detectable in core scale. moreover, in fault cores, it is by a factor of 10 higher in vertical direction than in horizontal direction. however, in areas between faults (fault gauge), permeability is in some parts by a factor of 10–100 lower in the vertical direction. adaptation of permeability ensures a fit to measured temperature and pressure data. permeability in fractured areas is the main factor inﬂuencing subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow and temperature distribution in the lahendong reservoir area. subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow is driven by local hydraulic heads, which show high variations at different sections of the study area. consequently, convective heat distribution leads to high temperature variation along the reservoir. these phenomena are observed in lahendong as well as comparable fields. in new mexico, water level drops of 30–100 m are observed across (haneberg 1995). high several

measured temperature and pressure at selected observation points. well specifications and measured data from  (2014) temperature drops and upwelling of isotherms indicate that fault zones control the ﬂuid ﬂow in the lake long and valentine fields, usa (hooper 1991). the analysis of ﬂuid pressure differences at the alpine fault, new zealand, allowed to characterize the change in permeability between hanging and footwall blocks ( 2012). in summary, high pressure or temperature gradients are indicators for ﬂuid barriers between observation points. in other words, reservoir sections of different properties are separated by horizontally less permeable faults. in lahendong, most significant ﬂuid barriers are faults to the sw and to the ne of lake linau. across these barriers, the pressure drops up to 20 bars. a similar pattern has been measured in bore logs beneath lake linau, where no surface trace of a fault had been observed in former studies. however, only by implementing another fault, modeled and measured values could have been adapted. the recently identified fault zone beneath lake linau remains under lake water and therefore is only traceable by this kind of reservoir modeling. additionally to fault identification, the internal structure of known fault zones has been understood in detail. the ne fault, i.e., shows a displacement at 2 km depth. the detailed trend has been understood by permeability adaptation in this area. due to low permeability in horizontal direction in the faults, ﬂuids propagate mostly vertically toward the hot springs at surface. it also allows surface water to infiltrate into the reservoir in case the pressure within the fault zone is low enough (). this vertical ﬂuid movement eventually controls the temperature distribution in the reservoir. upward migration of deep hot water increases the temperature, while infiltration of cold surface water causes local drop of temperature. in summary, the most important factors inﬂuencing the reliability of numerical reservoir models are absolute and different horizontal and vertical permeability. however, a permeability adaptation has been done for each geological layer; the vertical permeability anomalies are overprinting those layers and are constraining the regional groundwater ﬂow. those permeabilities of fractures directly inﬂuence the productivity of the reservoir ( 2013). therefore, their permeability characteristics should be investigated in detail. in a previous study, a numerical model for the lahendong site has been set up in tough2 and aimed at forecasting the reservoir behavior during exploitation until the year 2036. with a production of 60 mwe, it predicts a pressure drop of 10 bars. however, the forecast results are uncertain due to lack of measured pressure draw down data (yani 2006). accordingly, the next steps of the presented study should include a realistic production and injection scenario in order reservoir exploitation. furthermore, chemical characteristics could be considered to achieve reliable production setups, because hydrochemical processes play an important role in the lahendong reservoir ( 2016). presented models from this study provide important information on ﬂuid ﬂow in the water-dominated lahendong reservoir. however, additional the two-phase ﬂow models of to support sustainable\\x0c1088 page 10 of 11 environ earth sci (2016) 75:1088 lahendong area are in progress to understand the inﬂuence of steam driven ﬂuid ﬂow in this high-temperature system. conclusion the primary focus of this study is to understand the inﬂuence of fault zones and permeability patterns on subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow in geothermal reservoirs. the ﬂuid ﬂow mainly depends on rock and fault zone permeability. these processes have been considered in numerical models, which simulate local temperature and pressure conditions. the initial reservoir conditions, which refers to the case before production starts. models are developed based on the conceptual models of the study area, which explain reservoir geometry, geological structures, temperature, and hydraulic conditions. temperature and pressure well-logs have been used for model calibration. the numerical models represent vertical and horizontal ﬂuid ﬂow is mainly controlled by fault permeability. this characteristic is used to simulate different reservoir sections, and vertical ﬂuid rise toward the surface. by stepwise adaptation of permeability fields, based on observed temperature and pressure gradients, an additional blind fault zone can be identified beneath lake linau. temperature and pressure significantly drop across that ﬂuid barrier. this behavior has been observed in comparable fields in the usa as well. the overall shape of ﬂuid ﬂow direction trends in a sw–ne direction. main recharge occurs by infiltration of surface water into the faults, especially in the southwest and near to lake linau. discharge is enhanced in highly fractured areas toward lake linau. vertical permeability of faults allows ﬂuids rising toward the hot springs at surface. results show that permeability has to be considered for simulation of a geothermal system. the geothermal system is mainly controlled by ﬂuid ﬂow in fractures/faults depending on temperature and pressure conditions. the locally modified ﬂuid ﬂow can considerably inﬂuence the productivity of a geothermal field. results also guide reservoir management in case of a potential for field extension, as performed in lahendong. acknowledgments the authors acknowledge the continuous support within

keywords: geothermal energy granite high temperature stress-strain response triaxial acoustic xrd geothermal heat has now been identified as an effective renewable energy source due to severe environmental impacts created by conventional fossil usage on global climatic change. however, its wide application has been limited due to the lack of knowledge, particularly of the geothermal conditions of reservoir rocks at elevated temperatures and pressures. such high temperatures and pressures possibly alter the mechanical properties of reservoir rocks due to the associated micro-structural and mineralogical alterations of the rock mass, which are an important attribute for wellbore stability and stimulation of geothermal reservoirs for safe and effective geothermal energy extraction. this study therefore investigates the stress-strain behaviour under in-situ stress and temperature conditions by conducting a series of high-pressure, high-temperature tri-axial experiments on australian strathbogie granite under four different confining pressures (10, 30, 60, 90 mpa) and four different temperatures (rt, 100, 200, 300 ◦c). the effect of temperature on the mechanical behaviour of rock specimens was studied under tri-axial conditions and the corresponding fracture propagation behaviour was observed using an advanced acoustic emission (ae) system. the corresponding micro-structure alteration in granite was observed using sem analysis. according to the findings, increasing temperature leads to an initial increment in reservoir rock strength and shear parameters followed by reduction, and the trend is aligned with the crack formation pattern of the rock mass. this was further confirmed by the sem analysis, according to which the rock micro-structure is subject to only minor changes at relatively low temperatures and higher temperatures cause micro-cracks to develop along the rock mass grain boundaries. furthermore, the conventional mohr-coulomb criteria failed to model the stress-strain response of rock under geothermal reservoir conditions, and was therefore modified for the corresponding in-situ conditions. © 2016

adequate temperatures to serve as a geothermal reservoirs (, 2013). such explorations involve finding vast blocks of “hot rocks” with fracture systems. such rocks can be used to generate electricity. in this process, water is first injected and circulated through the fractures in the geothermal reservoirs and eventually pumped back to the surface as steam. however, the exploration of geothermal resources has become a challenge to engineers and geologists, due to the high temperature and stress environments in geothermal reservoirs. for this reason, laboratory experiments conducted under high pressure and temperature conditions (geothermal conditions) can assist in providing\\x0cw.g.p.  / geothermics 65 (2017) 44–59 45 basic predictions. a large number of laboratory experiments has therefore been conducted since 1970 to investigate the inﬂuence of high pressure and temperature on rock in relation to geothermal heat extraction (, 2016), deep geological disposal of nuclear waste (paquet and franc¸ ois, 1980), deep mining (wawersik and hannum, 1980) and geological co2 storage (, 2014). the mechanical behaviour of reservoir rocks is significantly inﬂuenced by elevated temperatures, because they cause the micro-structure of the rock mass to be altered through thermal expansion, the development of new micro-cracks, extending and/or widening the existing micro cracks and various mineralogical alterations. rock strength-deformation criteria change with temperature, and some rock mechanical properties, such as compressive strength, tensile strength, elastic modulus, cohesive strength and friction angle, decrease with increasing temperature (heuze, 1983; , 2008). however, such alterations are also affected by the confinement applying on the rock mass, and confining pressure causes the suppression of thermal cracks and the extension/widening of existing micro-cracks. this results in further alteration of the rock mass mechanical properties, resulting in changing failure modes (mogi, 1966). studies have identified the transition of rock failure mode from brittle to ductile with increasing confinement. however, this transition is diverse due to the different mineralogical compositions and grain boundaries in different rocks (, 2001; wong, 1982). although many studies have been conducted to investigate the temperature-dependent mechanical behaviour of reservoir rocks, most experiments have been conducted in unconfined environments (, 2015; , 2014). pre-heating the specimens to the corresponding temperature ranges and testing at room temperatures has been frequently done (bauer and johnson, 1979; , 2008), but the method is not reliable, as geothermal reservoirs experience continuous thermal stresses. such limitations have occurred mainly due to the limited number of appropriate test facilities available to simulate the stress and temperature conditions of actual geothermal reservoirs. although some studies have analytically and numerically evaluated the mechanical properties of rocks under high temperatures and pressures (chester and higgs, 1992; , 2013; , 2016), to date none has captured the stress-strain behaviour and failure criteria of rocks over a wide range of confining pressures and temperatures, particularly for australian granite. however, the thermo-elastic response and appropriate failure criteria are essential inputs for many engineering applications under high pressures and temperatures, including geothermal extraction applications. this study therefore intends to fill this gap, and it is hoped it will make an important contribution to many deep underground applications. 2. methodology 2.1. tested material granite is an abundant crystalline rock in the earth with medium to coarse grains which was formed as a result of the slow cooling of magma. granite therefore has abundant radioactive elements (k, th, and u). such elements bring elevated geothermal gradients to deep granite reservoirs, which therefore have ideal conditions as geothermal reservoirs. the mineralogical composition of granite mainly consists of quartz, feldspar, plagioclase and biotite, and small amounts of muscovite, amphibole, hornblende and opaque (, 2008). for the present study, samples were collected from the strathbogie batholith, which is a composite granitoid intrusion body spreading over more

(a) dilatancy and failure by strain softening under relatively low confining pressures and (b) failure by strain hardening under elevated confining pressures, and a transitional regime may be observed at intermediate pressures. these transitional failure modes have been referred to as “quasi-brittle”, and complex localized features such as conjugate shear bands can be observed under such conditions (, 2001; , 2004). by visual inspection of the post-failure samples, important information about the alteration of the granite failure mechanism with confining pressures and temperatures can be identified. postfailure images () were therefore collected after each test. according to the post-failure images, specimens that failed at 10–60 mpa confining pressures mainly failed by shear localization along an inclined macroscopic shear band with a single shear zone across each sample. however, samples tested at higher confinements of 90 mpa and 120 mpa (at 100 ◦c) exhibited strain hardening characteristics after achieving the peak stress, and several conjugate shear bands could be observed on the cylindrical sample surface, instead of the single shear band observed earlier. this characteristic was significant at 120 mpa confining pressure. however, it should be noted that only one test was conducted at 120 mpa confinement, because at such high confining pressures the corresponding failure load of granite exceeds the bottom pedestal’s load-bearing capacity. further, a progressive reduction was observed in the failure plane angle with respect to the minor principal stress direction with increasing confining pressure, which implies a reduction in friction angle, possibly due to the greater quasi-brittle behaviour that was shown by granite samples at higher confining pressures (, 2001). 3.2. effect of temperature and confining pressure on mechanical properties of strathbogie granite  illustrates the inﬂuence of temperature on the deviatoric stress of the tested granite under each confinement. as the figure shows, the inﬂuence of confinement is more significant than that of temperature in the temperature range considered here. wong and brace (1979) confirm that at lower confining pressures considerable thermal cracking occurs at relatively low temperatures. if thermal cracking is responsible for the reduction in failure strength, a sharp reduction in deviatoric stress with increasing temperature (with suppression of thermal cracks) should be exhibited under unconfined pressure condition. however, based on the experimental results, under unconfined conditions, up to 100 ◦c, 17.6% of increment in deviatoric stress is followed by 2.5% and 10.5% reductions at 200 ◦c and 300 ◦c, respectively. however, when confinement was applied, strength reduction was initiated after higher temperature of 200 ◦c, mainly due to the inhibition of a thermal cracks by induced compressive force. thermal cracking is therefore an important strength property alteration mechanism in reservoir rocks under certain confining pressure conditions. a clear inﬂuence of temperature on deviatoric stress at any depth or confinement can be observed, and increasing the temperature from room temperature to 200 ◦c causes an increment in deviatoric stress, and further increasing of temperature to 300 ◦c causes a slight reduction in it. this is because the thermal expansion which occurs with increasing temperature causes the reduction of .

which is only 0.19% of maximum measurement. during the load application, the axial strain was measured using linear variable differential transducers (lvdts) attached to the ram of the load cell ((a)). an acoustic emission (ae) system was also employed in the testing of samples to record the data related to the fracturing process. the ae system adopted was a peripheral component interconnection (pci) system with a nominal resolution frequency of 500 khz. during the experiments, two sensors were attached to either side of the loading shaft and with the external amplifiers, which generated low frequency acoustic waves with the fracturing of the sample. in addition, possible micro-structural and mineralogical changes that occurred during thermal and confinement effects were checked using sem analyses. 3. results and discussion 3.1. the overall stress-strain response the inﬂuence of temperature on the stress-strain behaviour of the tested granite was considered first

characteristics were relatively small up to 500 ◦c and beyond that an accelerated downward trend was identified. furthermore, wider localized zones were observed at high temperatures in the post-failure images. however, these studies were conducted at wider temperature ranges (up to 700 ◦c and 900 ◦c, respectively) and the researchers therefore did not pay close attention to reservoir rock behaviour under relatively low geothermal temperature ranges (<300 ◦c). this was the focus of the present study, according to which there is an initial strengthening and stiffening in granite with increasing temperature at low temperatures (up to 200 ◦c), and increasing the temperature beyond a certain value causes a gradual reduction in failure stress with increasing temperature. elastic modulus is an important mechanical property of any reservoir rock, and describes the brittle characteristics of the rock mass. it is therefore often used to evaluate many in-situ stress applications, including wellbore stability, fracturing possibility and tectonic stress distribution (heard and page, 1982). the temperature-dependent brittle properties (elastic modulus) of the tested granite were then evaluated. the elastic region of each stress-strain curve was used to calculate the temperature and pressure-dependent young’s moduli (e) and the results are shown in . the axial strain was measured using lvdts attached to the loading ram with a linearity ±0.1% f.s (full scale) (±0.0075 mm) and infinite resoluerror of tion (no hysteresis). an increment of the modulus of strathbogie granite with increasing temperature up to 200 ◦c can be observed, and further increase of temperature (to 300 ◦c) causes the elastic modulus to be slightly reduced for any confinement. this trend is\\x0ca ‘brittle’ or general increment in elastic modulus with increasing confinement can be observed until 90 mpa, and a further increase of confinement (to 120 mpa) reduces the young’s modulus considerably. with increasing confining stress additional plastic deformation occurs, exhibiting strain-hardening characteristics in granite under high confinements. however, within the range of the experiments conducted (10 mpa–120 mpa) it cannot be definitively identified as a ’ductile’ regime. however, the strain-hardening behaviour observed at 120 mpa indicates transitional characteristics and this can be identified as ‘quasi-brittle’ behaviour (, 2001). the initial young’s modulus reduction with increasing confinement was observed by heard and page (1982), who conducted tests up to 55 mpa confining pressure. however, the latter behaviour was not observed by these researchers. interestingly, according to the research literature, at low temperatures (<200 ◦c) some granite types are more temperature-sensitive, while in contrast, some granites are more temperature-sensitive at high temperatures. the initial strength enhancement is more significant for coarse-grained granites and granodiorite than for fine-grained granites. for example, according to heard and page (1982), stripa granite is more sensitive to temperature at relatively low temperatures (<200 ◦c), and westerly granite is more sensitive to temperature at high temperatures (>200 ◦c). such contradictory behaviours may occur in granite due to the different grain size distributions, grain orientations, mineralogical compositions and heterogeneity of different granite types. this indicates the importance of studying the mineralogical composition and microstructural inﬂuence of granites on such on temperature-dependent strength variations. 3.3. effect of temperature on shear strength parameters of strathbogie granite  illustrates the variation of deviatoric stress of the tested granite with confining pressure for each temperature. the figure shows that increasing confinement causes the granite’s deviatoric stress to increase non-linearly and gradually come to a steady state. this is consistent with similar previous studies, which have clearly shown the enhancement of rock strength with increasing confinement, and the increasing rate is reduced with increasing confining pressure (barton, 2013; , 2011). this is because at low confining pressures there is a high dilation potential. therefore, the ability to open rock micro-cracks is high, resulting in higher friction angles. however, this dilation potential and the corresponding tendency for micro-cracks to open are suppressed with increasing confinement, resulting in lower friction angles at higher confining pressures. therefore, the failure mechanism of the rocks shifts from brittle to ductile with increasing confinement, changing the shape of the mohr-coulomb failure envelope, and according to barton (1976), at critical confining pressure the mohr-coulomb failure envelope reaches a zero gradient. this has also been shown by hoek (1983). the present study has clearly identified this rock behaviour in the mohr-coulomb failure envelopes developed for each temperature condition (refer to ). according to , the traditional linear mohr-coulomb criteria are applicable only in the brittle region of the failure envelope, and at higher confinew.g.p.  / geothermics 65 (2017) 44–59 consistent with the temperature-dependent strength behaviour of the granite described above. the reason for the initial elastic module increment may be that the specimen becomes more brittle at the initial temperature ranges due to thermally-induced volumetric expansion and the associated pore volume reduction. the later slight reduction of young’s modulus with increasing temperature exhibits an enhancement in ductile behaviour (quasi-brittle characteristics) with further increase of temperature. this is possibly due to the increased crack density caused by the induced thermal crack development and the related weakening of the granite. 600 500 400 300 200 100 0 50 σ1-σ3(mpa) 0 100 temperature (ºc) 200

angle and (b) cohesion with different temperatures (considering linear region of the mohr coulomb failure envelope). the latter positive effect of temperature on cohesion, according to wong and brace (1979), increasing the temperature to an extreme value may cause weakening of the grain boundaries, dependent on the anisotropy of the rock matrix (due to potentially existing distinct mineral compounds in granite those may contain different thermo-elastic moduli and this may causes to generate different internal stresses with heating). according to wong and brace (1979), increasing the temperature causes the induction of thermal cracks in the rock mass due to the associated generation of internal stresses (eq. (2)): (2) e(cid:4)˛(cid:4)t = \\u2434 where, e, \\x01␣, \\x01t is the matrix young’s modulus, difference of thermal expansion coefficient of distinct mineral and temperature difference, respectively. when the internal stress (given by eq. (2)) exceeds the crack closure pressure with increasing temperature, thermal cracks form and further increase of temperature provides the surface energy required for the propagation of the initiated crack (, 2007). this results in alteration of the grain-tograin contacts in the rock matrix, which leads to reduced cohesion at higher temperatures. in the case of the variation of friction angle with increasing temperature, the granite friction angle appears to remain steady up to around 100 ◦c (52◦) and then slightly increases with increasing temperature (54◦ at 200 and 300 ◦ c, respectively). the friction between grain-to-grain contacts may be altered by the thermally-induced micro-structural modifications. however, this effect on grain contact is expected to be smaller at relatively low temperatures, resulting in relatively steady friction angle with increasing temperature at lower temperatures. however, a slight ments non-linearity must be taken into account. in addition to the confinement, according to this study, increasing temperature also alters the failure envelope of granite. an initial increment in deviatoric stress with increasing temperature can be observed up to 200 ◦c and further increase of temperature (to 300 ◦c) causes it to be slightly reduced. the temperature-dependent shear parameters of granite were investigated next, and the shear parameters can be obtained from the mohr-coulomb failure envelope. as suggested by  (2011), the mohr-coulomb parameters (cohesion and friction angle) were calculated using eq. (1), taking into account the linear region of the obtained mohr-coulomb failure envelope (considering only smaller confining stresses, up to 30 mpa) for each temperature condition to obtain the temperature-dependent shear strength parameters ().

(continued) enhancement in friction angle with increasing temperature can be seen, probably due to the increased resistance of mineral particles to external deformation as a result of the thermally-induced energy in the mineral particles. however, compared with cohesion, the temperature dependency on friction angle is relatively insignificant within the temperature region considered here. initial enhancement in shear parameters in sandstone with increasing temperature has been observed by  (2015) at relatively low temperature regions, and these researchers observed reduction in friction angle from 33.02◦ to 31.93◦ and an increment a in cohesion from 61.47 mpa to 66.44 mpa with increasing temperature from 25 ◦c to 100 ◦c. further, bauer and johnson (1979) observed around 10% reduction in cohesion and 40% reduction in friction angle in westerly granite with increasing temperature from room temperature to 300 ◦c, and  (1979) observed 7% reduction in cohesion and a 38% reduction in friction angle a with increasing temperature from room temperature to 400 ◦c and 300 ◦c, respectively. however, the variation of shear strength parameters with increasing temperature at relatively low temperatures (<300 ◦c) was not considered in the above studies. the observed initial shear strengthening may be due to the inhibition of micro-crack propagation by the plasticity mechanism which occurs at crack tips (duclos and paquet (1991)) at low temperatures. with further increment of temperature, the reduction of shear strength parameters can be expected, due to the thermal weakening of the rock micro-structure. furthermore, according to the sem studies conducted by  (2007), large local plastic deformations and extremely rough cleavage fractures occur at relatively low temperatures. moreover, due to the volume expansion, the distance between the interfaces of the individual minerals decreases with the enhancement of their mutual attraction, and the strength of the bonds increases (dmitriev, 1972). both of these phenomena can be considered to explain the stress strengthening of granite under relatively low temperatures when subjected to confining pressures. 3.4. analysis of fracturing behaviour using ae technology acoustic emission (ae) detection technology is a powerful nondestructive tool to study crack propagation processes in brittle materials, including the stages of crack initiation, growth and crack damage (lockner, 1993). when a brittle material is under stress, strain energy is released during the development of new cracks or the widening of existing cracks. this energy is released in the form of elastic stress waves from the crack tips, and can be captured and amplified by an ae system. ae detection technology has therefore been widely used in a number of previous studies to understand the crack development mechanism in brittle materials (chang and lee, 2004; , 2000; , 2005). by incorporating the crack propagation pattern into the stressstrain relationship of the cracking material, the crack development process can be divided into several stages. hoek and bieniawski (1965) divided crack formation into five main stages: crack closure, crack initiation, secondary cracking, crack coalescence and crack damage. later,  (2008) and  (2015) incorporated stress-strain curves into cumulative ae counts/energy and strain plots. in the crack propagation process, with the gradual increment of loading on brittle materials, most pre-existing cracks are first closed, releasing an insignificant number of ae counts. this initial crack closure period is followed by the stable crack propagation period, which can be identified by the release of gradual ae energy increments. further increment of loading causes an exponential increase in ae energy, indicating an unstable crack propagation period with failure approaching. the crack closure threshold ((cid:2)cc) is defined as the stress threshold at which the initial ae counts are identified. anan initial increment in cumulative ae\\x0c54 w.g.p.  / geothermics 65 (2017) 44–59 counts can be seen at the crack initiation ((cid:2)ci) threshold, and the cumulative ae counts starts exponential growth at the crack damage ((cid:2)cd) threshold. the region between the crack closure threshold and the crack initiation threshold is generally defined as the stable crack closure region, where linear elastic deformation occurs. the region between the crack initiation threshold and the crack damage threshold is defined as the stable crack propagation region, and the region between the crack damage threshold and sample failure is identified as the unstable crack propagation region. the application of compressive loading fails rocks through either shear localization (brittle regime) or cataclastic ﬂow, and the surrounding conditions, such as temperatures and pressures, may cause a homogenous plastic ﬂow. according to existing studies, axial intra-granular cracking and shear rupturing of cemented grain contacts can be observed before failure in brittle regimes, and grain crushing and pore collapse can be identified before failure in cataclastic ﬂow regimes (, 1996). according to  (1997), the development of local stress concentrations leads to the initiation of many intra-granular micro-cracks in the rock mass, and the crack density increases with increasing deviatoric stress and tends to merge on reaching the peak stress, resulting in strain softening and shear localization. these damage processes are clearly identified by the intense ae activities in the field (chang and lee, 2004). ae technology was therefore used to investigate the progressive fracturing behaviour in strathbogie granite under tri-axial conditions.  illustrates the cumulative ae events with axial stress at various pressures and temperatures for the tested specimens. the corresponding variations of deviatoric stress against strain are also included in the same plots to identify the stress thresholds for crack closure, crack initiation and crack damage (). the very high ae counts in strathbogie granite at dilatancy in the pre-failure stage are due to the fact that ae waves generate when the local shear stress concentration at a grain contact is sufficiently high to rupture the grain boundaries, and frictional slips and grain rotations may occur once the grain contacts have lost their cohesion. in the present study, crack threshold ratios were defined to identify the temperature and pressure-dependent crack propagation in the tested granite as follows, and  shows the crack propagation stress threshold ratios of granite specimens tested at various confining pressures and temperatures. crack closure stress threshold = deviatoric stress at crack closure stress deviatoric stress at failure ((cid:2)cc) crack initiation stress threshold = deviatoric stress at crack initiation stress deviatoric stress at failure ((cid:2)ci) crack damage stress threshold = deviatoric stress at crack damage stress ((cid:2)cd) deviatoric stress at failure according to the results, the beginning of crack damage occurs at earlier stages of deviatoric loading for higher confining pressures. however, the crack damage stress increases with increasing confinement due to the inﬂuence of confining pressure on thermal crack development and the suppression of the extension/widening of existing micro-cracks. according to , in the temperature range considered here, three tendencies can be identified with increasing confining pressure: increase of the elastic deformation region, decrease of the stable crack propagation region, and increase of the unstable crack propagation region. the crack initiation stress threshold also progressively increases with increasing confining pressure, which can be attributed to the fact that the brittle behaviour of rock specimens at lower confining pressures changes to quasi-brittle behaviour with increasing confining pressure. this is because the suppression of micro-crack development is less at low confining pressures, and therefore sudden failures mostly occur, and the beginning of crack initiation occurs at earlier stages of deviatoric loading at high confining pressures due to the higher normal stress acting on micro-cracks, resulting in limited progression of cracking before failure. in relation to the temperature effect, increasing the temperature causes an initial increment in the crack propagation stress threshold, followed by a slight reduction for all the temperature conditions considered. for example, at 30 mpa confinement, the crack damage stress threshold ratios increased by around 6.8%, 10.5% with increasing temperature from room temperature to 100 and 200 ◦c, respectively, and reduced by around 4.0% when the temperature increased to 300 ◦c. this implies that at low temperatures a suppressed micro-crack development mechanism is dominant, and increasing the temperature causes crack damage to occur at earlier loading stages. interestingly, at 60 mpa confinement the crack damage stress threshold ratio increased by around 4.9%, 5.4%, 2.6% with increasing temperature from room to 100, 200 and 300 ◦c, respectively. this exhibits the cumulative effect of temperature and pressure micro-crack development in the rock mass. at relatively low temperatures, micro-crack propagation may be inhibited by the thermally-induced plasticity mechanism which occurs at crack tips and the increased bonding strength through thermally-induced rock matrix expansion (which increases crack stress thresholds). however, further increase of temperature creates thermally-induced cracks and causes the grain boundary cracks to widen, resulting in early crack damage. further, with the inﬂuence of confinement, micro-crack development is suppressed, causing a relatively low increment of crack damage stress threshold ratios at higher confinements. 3.5. corresponding alterations in granite micro-structure a comprehensive micro-structural analysis was also performed to identify the interior correspondences of the above-described temperature-dependent mechanical behaviour of granite. sem and optical microscopic analyses were performed on thin sections of granite specimens at various temperatures: room temperature (20 ◦c), pre-heated (72 hours) to 200 ◦c and 400 ◦c (). these temperatures were selected to identify the microstructural behaviour at 200 ◦c, at which the highest strength increment was observed, and 400 ◦c, at which clear thermally-induced rock mass weakening was observed. a specimen at room temperature was used as a control. based on optical microscope imaging, mineralogical assembling in the granite specimen could be identified by the colour and texture of each of the mineral assemblages. further, a detailed sem study was performed using scanning electron imaging (sei) and bsei back-scatter electron imaging (bsei) techniques. bsei images taken at low magnifications clearly show different mineral assemblages and grain boundaries (see ). using energy-dispersive x-ray (edx) technology with aztec oxford instruments, chemical component mapping was generated in each specimen, and each mineral was identified qualitatively. the bright colour images observed in edx images indicate higher concentration (higher energy dispersion) while dark colour areas indicate lower concentration (lower energy dispersion). based on the spectrum of each point (point id), the corresponding mineral was identified and a map spectrum provided overall elements available for each specimen. according to  and 14, there are clear mineralogical assembling in the granite specimens, mainly with quartz, kfeldspar and plagioclase. the heating of granite up to 200 ◦c temperature has not caused any significant thermally-induced micro-cracks (in addition to the pre-existing faults and grain boundaries) and almost all grain boundaries remain intact. however, further heating of granite to the higher temperature of 400 ◦c caused the induction of some micro-cracks, mainly

quartz feldspar boundaries. however, only a few grain\\x0c56 w.g.p.  / geothermics 65 (2017) 44–59 . optical microscopic and sem images of thin sections of strathbogie granite (a) at room temperature; (b) pre-heated to 100 ◦c (c) pre-heated to 400 ◦c. boundaries have been partially parted and a significant number of grain boundaries appear to remain intact up to this temperature. furthermore, based on the edx mapping, it was confirmed that intra-granular cracks are mainly initiated along the feldspar and quartz minerals. intragranular cracks were mainly observed in larger crystals (crystals greater than 0.5 mm) and smaller crystals remained un-parted even at 400 ◦c. for strathbogie granite, thermally-induced intra-granular micro-cracks seem to play a significant role at relatively low temperatures, probably due to the presence of relatively high k feldspar and biotite contents. similar observations have been reported in bauer and johnson’s (1979) study conducted for charcoal granite, where intra-granular microcracks predominantly occur compared to grain boundary cracks. the sem analysis is also consistent with this finding, which exhibits inhibition of micro-crack development followed by micro-cracking at relatively high temperatures. the crack propagation process in any rock mass is largely inﬂuenced by the mineralogical composition, because cracks normally propagate through weaker planes of the rock mass. since granite is an igneous type of rock, two main types of thermallyinduced cracking modes can be identified: inter-granular and intragranular. the amount of inter-granular or intra-granular cracking is dependent on the stress state, rock type and mineralogy of the rock mass. inter-granular cracks occur along grain boundaries, pre-existing faults and micro-cracks of the rock, while intragranular cracks occur through weaker mineralogical constituents (kranz, 1983). for example, k feldspar and biotite are weaker mineralogical constituents due to their large crystals (>10 mm), as crystals greater than 2–3 mm in size are generally defined as weaker mineralogical constituents compared to equi-dimensional small crystals like quartz (homand-etienne and houpert, 1989). based on experimental results, intra-granular cracking is highly temperature-dependent due to the temperature dependent dislocations in the rocks. this is because different mineralogical components have different thermo-elastic moduli and thermal conductivities (kranz, 1983; , 2008). these observations suggest that micro-cracking in granite is highly temperature dependent, as evidenced by the previously observed initial strength gain followed by slight strength reduction with increasing temperature in the tested granite. however, this shows that granite needs to be heated to a sufficient temperature to cause thermal cracks in it and therefore, heating to a lower temperature may only cause a strength gain through the thermal expansion of the rock matrix. this is consistent with the results of bauer and johnson (1979). the mechanical properties of charcoal granite in their study remained relatively steady until 200 ◦c, and westerly granite exhibited a significant thermal dependency, even at relatively low temperatures (<200 ◦c). in homand-etienne and houpert (1989) study, the variation of uni-axial compressive strength of both semones and remiremont granites is insignificant until 400 ◦c, followed by significant reductions at higher temperatures. these results indicate the dependency of mineralogical composition and grain size distribution on the temperature dependent mechanical behaviour in various types of granites. however,\\x0cw.g.p.  / geothermics 65 (2017) 44–59 57 . bse images of strathbogie granite with edx mapping:

different confining pressures (10, 30, 60, 90 mpa) and four different temperatures (rt, 100, 200, 300 ◦c), simulating various geothermal reservoir conditions. the following conclusions can be drawn: mechanical behaviour of the tested granite is inﬂuenced by both reservoir depth and temperature, and the depth effect is much greater than the temperature effect. granite located at relatively smaller depths appears to fail through shear localization and increasing depth may cause this to change to ductile failure through strain hardening. a progressive enhancement in stress threshold with increasing confining pressure is observed in strathbogie granite. such behaviours exhibit greater strength and lower brittle characteristics in granite located at greater depths. increasing of temperature causes granite’s strength to be enhanced up to a certain temperature (around 200 ◦c for strathbogie granite) through the possible thermal expansion of the rock matrix and further increasing of temperature may cause it to weaken by inducing thermal cracks. this was confirmed by the micro-structural analysis, which did not reveal any noticeable amount of thermally-induced micro-cracking in strathbogie granite up to 200 ◦c, and heating of the granite to a greater temperature as 400 ◦c caused many intra-granular cracks in quartz and feldspar and some grain boundary cracks between quartz and feldspar minerals. furthermore, according to ae analysis, increasing the temperature first causes the crack propagation stress threshold to increase and further increasing of the temperature causes it to be slightly reduced. this indicates a suppression of micro-cracks at low temperatures by matrix expansion and the development of micro-cracks through thermally-induced damage at higher temperatures. finally an attempt was made to improve the conventional mohrcoulomb failure criteria for geothermal reservoirs with extreme pressures and temperatures, because the conventional criteria are not applicable to extreme conditions. acknowledgements this research project is funded by the australian research council (arc dp160104223) and the authors would like to

reservoirs. the present study may therefore capture more realistic geothermal reservoir behaviour. 3.6. temperature-dependent failure criteria for strathbogie granite ≤ (3) − is questionable, due to the to date, although many strength criteria are available for intact rock, the practical application of most of them for geothermal reservoirs in-situ model parameters required when considering the available high-pressure and high-temperature environment in underground reservoirs. of the various failure criteria, the mohr-coulomb failure criteria have been extensively used in the field and have made a significant contribution to the determination of rock mass failure. however, they have some major limitations, including ignoring the intermediate stress (cid:2)2 inﬂuence (which has been proven to have a substantial inﬂuence on rock strength) and the assumed linearity (the strength criteria of rock are non-linear in reality). after re-analyzing thousands of reported triaxial experiments and combining the critical state concept proposed by barton (1976),  (2011) proposed a non-linear mohr-coulomb failure criterion. according to the findings of  (2011), the mohr-coulomb shear strength parameters should only be obtained by performing conventional tri-axial tests under low confining stresses (in the linear region of the mohr-coulomb failure envelope). according to their statistical analysis, (cid:2)cc ≈ (cid:2)crit, where (cid:2)c and (cid:2) crit are uni-axial compressive strength and critical confining pressure, respectively. the modified mohr-coulomb failure criterion proposed by  is given below: (cid:2)1 − (cid:2)3 = where, (cid:2)ci ≈ (cid:2)ci + 2sin(cid:3)i0 sin(cid:3)i0 ucs of the rock = 2ciocos(cid:3)i0/1 sin(cid:3)i0, (cid:3)i0 and cio are friction

failure criteria cannot be directly applied to geothermal reservoir rocks at extreme pressures and temperatures, because the strength response is altered by the thermal effect (heuze, 1983). to date, no extensive study has captured this thermal response in the improved mohrcoulomb failure criteria. such a realistic approach is necessary for deep underground engineering applications like geothermal energy extraction. the concepts of barton (1976) and  (2011) are therefore incorporated into the temperature inﬂuence in this study and an attempt is made to propose novel strength criteria for geothermal reservoir rocks based on experimental data: + 2sin(cid:3)i (t) sin(cid:3)i (t) (cid:2)3 − − 1 − (cid:2)3 (t) = 2ci (t) cos(cid:3)i (t) sin(cid:3)i (t) 1 (cid:2)1 − (4) (cid:2)3 ≤

wang, 2014). site selection for china's hlw repository started in 1985 (wang, 2010). the efforts have been focused on potential hlw repository sites located within granite intrusions in mainland china. since 1999, the beijing research ⁎ corresponding author. e-mail address:  (x.g. zhao).  0040-1951/© 2016 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved. institute of uranium geology (briug) has performed site characterization studies in the beishan area, china. so far, the beishan area has been considered as the most potential candidate area for china's hlw repository. among all the engineering properties of crystalline rocks at a potential hlw repository site, the thermal conductivity is one of the most important parameters in design consideration because it has a direct impact on the evaluation of the necessary repository volume and the optimization of the repository layout (sundberg and hellström, 2009). for instance, in the swedish kbs-3 concept for geological disposal of spent fuel, copper canisters with cast iron inserts containing the spent fuel are surrounded by bentonite for isolation and mechanical protection (, 2006). the heat generated by the spent fuel will increase the temperature of all components of the repository. for the bentonite buffer outside the canisters, the peak temperature must not exceed 100 °c. this requirement implies that the canisters cannot be deposited arbitrarily close to each other. on the other hand, unnecessarily large distances between the canisters will mean inefficient and costly use of the repository rock volume (, 2009). to fulfill the temperature requirement, the rocks with low thermal conductivities will\\x0cx.g.  / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137 125 lead to a larger distance between canisters than for a case with high thermal conductivities. this is because the rocks with low thermal conductivities will give rise to higher temperatures in the bentonite (, 2008). hence, to design and construct repositories successfully, it is essential to perform an accurate assessment of the thermal conductivity characteristics of the host rock. over the past few decades, various experimental approaches have been employed to measure the thermal conductivity of rocks. the results indicate that the thermal conductivity of rocks is closely associated with mineral composition, porosity, texture, and density, etc. (birch and clark, 1940; clauser and huenges, 1995; , 2005; , 2004; , 2015; , 2007; , 2009). for crystalline rocks with relatively homogeneous texture and low porosity, the mineral composition dominates the thermal conductivity. in volcanic and sedimentary rocks, the high variability of porosity in these rocks is a major factor controlling the thermal conductivity (clauser and huenges, 1995; , 2004). for example, increasing porosity, which acts as barrier to the ﬂow of heat, often results in both lower p-wave velocity and lower thermal conductivity values (, 2004). for a given rock, water content and temperature have an inﬂuence on its thermal conductivity. generally, the thermal conductivity of the rock increases and decreases with increasing water content (cho and kwon, 2010; , 2009) and temperature (, 2009; birch and clark, 1940; heuze, 1983; , 2014; , 2008; vosteen and schellschmidt, 2003), respectively. moreover, the effect of water saturation on the thermal conductivity of rocks shows a generally increasing trend with increasing porosity (nagaraju and roy, 2014). given that the thermal conductivity of surrounding rocks around the excavations will be changed by the excavation-induced stress, some researchers studied the inﬂuence of pressure on the thermal conductivity of rocks (, 2010; , 2009; , 2004; , 2008; sibbitt, 1976; walsh and decker, 1966; zimmerman, 1989). one of the main findings achieved from these investigations shows that the thermal conductivity varies with the pressure exerted on the rock. with increasing applied pressure, the thermal conductivity starts to increase and subsequently the increase rate tends to be a constant value due to gradual closure of cracks and pores within the rock (, 2008; walsh and decker, 1966). while the above-mentioned studies provide meaningful insight into the thermal conductivity of various rocks, the thermal conductivity characteristics of low-porosity crystalline rocks subjected to different external factors such as water saturation, temperature and compression stress have not been fully understood. on the other hand, the information on the thermal conductivity of rocks in a potential hlw repository site must be known with sufficient confidence to provide necessary input conditions for its long-term safety assessment, which is one of the motivations for this study. in this work, experimental investigations on the thermal conductivity of the beishan granitic rocks are conducted using the transient plane source (tps) method. in the following discussion, rock sampling and basic physical properties of the rock specimens are introduced first. testing facilities and procedures are then described. subsequently, the water saturation, temperature and compression stress dependent thermal conductivity characteristics of the tested rocks are evaluated comprehensively, and finally some insights are obtained. 2. rock sampling and preparation the beishan area is situated in gansu province of northwestern china (see ). after a long geological evolution and weathering process, the topography of this area is characterized by a ﬂat gobi and small gentle rolling hills with elevations ranging between 1400 and 2000 m above the sea level. the crust in this area possesses a blocky structure with many granite intrusions (see ). other surrounding rocks include mainly metamorphic and sedimentary rocks, as well as quaternary cover. rock sampling was carried out in the jijicao and xinchang rock blocks, which are currently considered as two of the key investigation sub-areas during site selection and characterization. . geographical location of the beishan area and a photo showing its typical topography.\\x0c126 x.g.  / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137 xinchang bs06 bs18 bs19 jijicao bs16 bs15 bs05 n 2.5 km granitic rock sedimentary rock metamorphic rock quaternary cover borehole fault . rock sampling from six boreholes in the jijicao and xinchang sub-areas for thermal conductivity measurements. intact drill cores with a diameter of approximately 63 mm were taken from six sub-vertical boreholes (i.e., boreholes bs05, bs06, bs15, bs16, bs18 and bs19) in these two sub-areas. the borehole locations are presented in . field observations indicated that the collected granitic rocks were relatively isotropic in texture and mineralogical composition. to evaluate the geological nature of the rocks, a series of thin sections were prepared and then exposed to cross-polarized light under an optical microscope to identify the dominant minerals in the rocks. the percentages of the dominant minerals were determined by point counting on thin sections. for each thin section approximately 500 points covering phenocrysts and groundmass were counted. according to the quartz-alkali feldspar-plagioclase (qap) diagram (streckeisen, 1976), the rocks can further be classified. it can be observed from  that the rocks contain mainly a moderate to low amount of quartz and alkali feldspar, and a moderate to high amount of plagioclase. this means that the collected rocks dominantly range from granodiorite to monzogranite. for grain size characteristics, the rocks are from fine grained to, medium to coarse grained. an overview of the basic information of the rocks is listed in . based on the borehole no. and sampling depth, these rocks have been divided into eight groups. a total of 47 pairs of rock specimens, 50 mm in diameter, were prepared from the drill cores with a length to diameter ratio of approximately 0.5. in particular, specimen ends were polished carefully using a q 90 90 i granodiorite ii monzogranite 60 60 ii i bs05 bs06 bs15 bs16 bs18-1 bs18-2 bs19-1 bs19-2 20 20 5 5 p 10 35 65 90 a . qap classification of the eight rock groups based on modal analysis. grinding machine until the ﬂatness and roughness of the ends are less than 10 μm and 3 μm, respectively. the ﬂat and polished specimen end surfaces minimize the thermal contact resistance during thermal conductivity measurement. a minimum of ten specimens for each rock group were prepared. 3. test methodology 3.1. an introduction to the used tps method in the fields of geology and geophysics, laboratory approaches to measuring soil and rock thermal conductivity can mainly be divided into two groups: steady state and transient state. in this work, the transient plane source (tps) method (gustafsson, 1991; log and gustafsson, 1995) was utilized to measure the thermal conductivity of the specimens. as one of the transient measurement methods, the tps technique is based on the use of a transiently heated plane sensor (i.e., hot disk sensor) and a hot disk thermal constants analyser (see a). the used hot disk tps2500s system can measure thermal conductivity of materials ranging from 0.01 to 400 w/mk. the hot disk sensor consists of a continuous double spiral, which is etched out of a thin nickel foil (e). this spiral is sandwiched between two sheets of electrical insulation materials made of kapton. the sensor acts both as a heat source for increasing the temperature of the specimens and as a dynamic temperature sensor for recording the temperature increase. during the measurement, the temperature in the sensor rises and heat starts to ﬂow to the specimens. the temperature rise in the sensor provides an indicator of the thermal properties of the specimens. if the specimens have good thermal conducting properties, the heat will be transported rapidly inside the specimens. on the contrary, if the specimens have good thermal insulation properties, the sensor temperature will rise faster and the heat will not be transported as much as in the test of the good thermal conducting specimens. compared with steady state measurement methods such as the divided bar (beck and beck, 1958; birch, 1950; , 1971) and the guarded hot plate (, 2009; , 2012), one of significant advantages of the tps technique is that the thermal conductivity of materials can be measured more quickly, typically from several to tens of seconds. hence, a long wait for thermal gradients to equilibrate is not required and the moisture migration in response to temperature gradients was minimized (jackson and taylor, 1986). on the other hand, unlike some transient methods such as thermal needle probes (barry-, 2013; von herzen and maxwell, 1959), which are commonly used for soils and soft rocks, the tps method can be\\x0cx.g.  / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137 127  basic information and geological description of the tested rocks. rock type and group basic information mineral composition naked eye observation photomicrograph of a thin section monzogranite (bs05) location: jijicao borehole no.: bs05 sampling depth: 5–7 m number of specimen pairs: 7 grain size: medium plagioclase: 33.7% ± 5.8%;

, 2003). hence, the thermal resistance between the specimen ends and the sensor exists (see section 3.2). so far, the tps technology has been widely used to\\x0c128 x.g.  / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137 a c temperature control system b hot disk thermal constants analyser sensor platen specimens d e specimens insulation material chamber sensor specimens oil bath sensor double spiral cable extension . the hot disk tps2500s system (a) used to measure the thermal conductivity of specimens under room temperature (d), high temperature (c), and uniaxial compression (b) conditions. a hot disk sensor showing its key components (e). determine the thermal properties of different materials (, 2015; , 2008; urquhart and bauer, 2015; , 2014; , 2012). 3.2. theory of the tps technique to theoretically describe how the tps method behaves, the thermal conductivity equation can be solved assuming that the hot disk sensor consists of a certain number of concentric ring heat sources located in an infinitely large sample (hot disk, 2007). a constant electric power supplied to the sensor results in an increase in temperature which is directly related to the variation in the sensor resistance (r(t)) by the equation: \\x10 \\x11 r tð þ ¼ r0 1 þ αδt τð þ ð1þ where r0 is the nickel electrical resistance in the beginning of the recording, α is the temperature coefficient of resistance of the nickel foil, and δtðτþ is the mean value of temperature rise in the sensor due to a constant current pulse given by: \\x10 δt τð þ ¼ p0 π3=2ak \\x11−1d τð þ ð2þ where p0 is the total output of power from the sensor, a is the sensor radius, k is the thermal conductivity of the sample that is being tested and d(τ) is a dimensionless time dependent function with: τ ¼ t=θð ð3þ þ1=2; θ ¼ a2=d where t is the time measured from the start of the transient recording, θ is the characteristic time, which depends both on parameters of the sensor and the sample, and d is the thermal diffusivity of the sample. according to eq. (2), and δtðτþ and d(τ) plotted as a function of τ provides a linear relationship with a slope that is a function of p0, a, and k. thermal conductivity k can be obtained by fitting the experimental data to the straight line given by eq. (2); thermal diffusivity d is calculated from eq. (3) taking into account the τ value determined in the previous fit. as mentioned above, the solution of the thermal conductivity equation is based on the assumption that the hot disk sensor is located in an infinite material in perfect contact with the sensor surface. this means that the heat ﬂow generated from each measurement must not reach the outside boundaries of the specimen (hot disk, 2007). meanwhile, a careful preparation of specimen ends is required to minimize thermal contact resistance. an estimation of how far the heat ﬂow has proceeded in the specimen during a recording is the probing depth δp, which is defined as (hot disk, 2007): ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ p dt δp ¼ 2 ð4þ to determine the thermal conductivity with good accuracy, the shortest distance from any part of the sensor to the nearest outside boundary of the sample should be larger than δp. in our experiments, the used hot disk sensor has a radius of 6.403 mm. the shortest distance is about 19 mm, and the probing depth is approximately 10 mm. for this probing depth value, we can consider that we are conducting a bulk measurement. 3.3. test procedures 3.3.1. tests on specimens under saturated and dry conditions firstly, the specimens were immersed by deionized water in a vacuum for a period of 96 h. the specimens were then taken from the vacuum and the water droplets on the surfaces were wiped dry, care being taken to ensure that no rock grains or fragments were lost. the mass of the water-saturated specimens (msat) was measured using a\\x0cx.g.  / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137 129 loading measurement 60 50

precision balance (to 0.0001 g). our tests revealed that the mass of the specimens could be approximately constant under vacuum within 72 h (see ), indicating that the specimens were saturated with water. subsequently, the hot disk sensor was horizontally placed between the two saturated specimen pieces with the double spiral centered and totally covered, and the two specimen pieces were firmly clamped together to ensure that there was no air gap between the sensor and the specimen end surfaces, as presented in d. in order to remain water saturation, the saturated specimens and the sensor were kept in a plastic bag during thermal conductivity measurement (adl-zarrabi, 2004). after the test, the used water-saturated specimens were suffered from dehydration treatment in a thermostatic drying oven at 105 °c for a period of 24 h and subsequently cooled in a desiccator to measure the thermal conductivity under a dry condition. meanwhile, the mass of the dry specimens (mdry) was measured, and the porosity (n) of the specimens was calculated using the equations n ¼ 100v p v % v p ¼ msat − mdry ρw ð5þ ð6þ where v is the bulk rock volume, vp is the pore volume, and ρw is the density of water. for each pair of specimens saturated or dried, measurements on the thermal conductivity were carried out at room temperature (25 ± 1 °c). 3.3.2. tests on specimens under increasing temperature to investigate the effect of temperature on the thermal conductivity of the tested rocks, measurements were performed on dry specimens from 40 °c to 150 °c based on the requirements of the used test equipment. compared with measurements at room temperature, the experiments under high temperature are time consuming due to a slow stepwise heating process by using a constant temperature oil bath and a temperature control system, as shown in c. the thermal conductivity measurement can only be conducted until the two specimen pieces in the chamber with a specimen holder within the oil bath have reached thermal equilibrium and kept a target temperature value. during thermal equilibrium of the oil bath, the hot disk sensor monitors continuously the temperature variation of the specimens. for our tests, the thermal conductivity of the specimens was measured when the recorded temperature variation of the specimens is less than 0.04 °c. in general, 32 h were needed to complete

measurement, the load was maintained constant for a period of about 15 min to avoid residual temperature drifts on the specimens. based on the in-situ stress measurement results obtained from the beishan area (, 2013), the maximum axial compression stress applied to the specimens was set to be 45 mpa to approximately simulate the excavation-induced stress near the vertical hlw disposal element boundary at a depth of 600 m. the axial stress applied to the specimens was recorded automatically, and the used stress path throughout the course of testing is presented in . the experiments were conducted at room temperature. according to previous experimental results (, 2015a; , 2015b), the identified crack initiation stresses of cylindrical specimens of beishan granitic rocks under uniaxial compression using the cumulative ae hit (caeh) method range from 45.3 to 109.1 mpa, which are larger than the maximum compression stress adopted in the present study. hence, the stress-induced rock damage might not occur in the tested specimens during loading. it should be mentioned that in the process of loading, the friction may occur at the interfaces between the specimen ends and the sensor. due to limitation of the tps measurement technique, the utilized test method does not consider the potential inﬂuence of interface friction effect on the experimental results. to reduce or eliminate the friction effect, further efforts are needed to produce innovative design for the test equipment. although not perfect, the developed test system provides a feasible means for us to gain insight into thermal conductivity behaviors of rocks under compression. 4. test results 4.1. inﬂuence of water saturation on the thermal conductivity  porosity, thermal conductivity and effect of water

about how the gradual heating and the thermal equilibrium processes would affect the water content of the specimens, leading to difficulties in evaluating the relationship between the thermal conductivity and the water saturation degree of the specimens quantitatively. 3.3.3. tests on specimens under uniaxial compression the uniaxial compression tests on dry specimens were conducted using a hydraulic servo-controlled compression machine. for each test, two specimen pieces with the hot disk sensor were contained between steel platens machined to match their end surfaces, as shown in b. the interfaces between the specimens and the steel platens were daubed with a thin layer of lubricant to reduce the end effect of the platens during loading. when the experimental setup was completed, axial-load control was used with a loading rate of 100 n/s and the axial load was increased with an increment thermal conductivity measurements were carried out on the 40 pairs of specimens both in dry and water-saturated conditions, and the results are listed in . a statistical analysis shows that for the eight rock groups under dry or saturated state, the standard deviation (sd) and coefficient of variation (cov) of the thermal conductivity are all less than 0.06 w/mk and 4%, respectively, indicating that the results between specimens in each rock group have a good consistency. for all rock groups, the average thermal conductivity values in the dry state (kdry) range between 2.412 and 2.812 w/mk. the values under watersaturated condition (ksat) for the same set of specimens

higher thermal conductivity (0.604 w/mk) replaced the air with a lower thermal conductivity (0.025 w/mk) in the void of the rocks, leading to an increase of the thermal conductivity. for our data set,

is seen that the thermal conductivity of the specimens shows a decaying trend with increasing temperature, and the values at 150 °c range from 5.7% to 8.7% lower than those at room temperature. this means that within the used temperature range, the inﬂuence of the increasing temperature on the decay of thermal conductivity for these rocks is limited. on the other hand, a possible reason for the gradual decrease in thermal conductivity is the generation of thermally induced microcracks in the rocks because of a mismatch between thermal expansion coefficients of adjacent mineral grains in a homogeneous temperature field (, 1993), which has been demonstrated from a microcracking perspective based on numerical simulations (zhao, 2016). based on the experimental data, the relationship between thermal conductivity and temperature can be described using the equation: k ¼ kr − at2 ð8þ where kr is the thermal conductivity of the rock at room temperature (25 °c), t is the temperature in celsius, and a is the fit coefficient (see ). the parameter a affects the decaying velocity of the thermal conductivity with the temperature, i.e., the decaying velocity of the thermal conductivity increases as a increases. as shown in , a in eq.

clauser, 2009) have been proposed. comprehensive overviews and case studies on such mixing models can be found in (, 2009; clauser, 2009; , 2013; hartmann, 2005; , 2015). based on the experimental data (see ) in combination with the methodology used by  (2013), the abovementioned mixing models were used to predict the thermal conductivity values of the tested rocks in the water-saturated state.  shows the comparison between measured and calculated thermal conductivities for the four different models. it can be observed from a, b, and d that the geometric mean, the arithmetic mean, and the effectivemedium mean yield similar prediction results and consistently underestimate the thermal conductivity of the eight rock groups, especially for the groups with relatively high porosity values (e.g., groups bs05 and bs15). the hashin–shtrikman mean shows a reasonably good fit for all rock groups, as shown in c. the analysis results are basically in line with observations reported by  (2013) because most of the evaluated mixing models used in their analysis also underestimate the thermal conductivity of the rocks. however, the geometric mean model was rated as the best fit to their data set. it should be noted that the rocks used in their analysis covered different rock types with a large range in porosity, from almost zero to about 30%. in addition, the measured thermal conductivity values of these rocks spans the interval between 1.0 and 6.5 w/mk. the present investigations focused mainly on the granitic rocks with low porosities and a narrow thermal conductivity range. hence, the large difference of rock properties may result in uncertainties between analysis results obtained from various mixing models. more work is required to explain this discrepancy. nagaraju and roy (2014) defined the effect of water saturation on thermal conductivity (s) as a function of porosity of rocks, and s is expressed by s ¼ ksat − kdry ð7þ kdry according to the measurement results listed in , we established the relationship between s and the porosity of the rocks, as presented in . analysis of  reveals that the effect of water saturation on thermal conductivity of rocks presents an increasing trend with an increase of porosity. a linear form expression can fit the data reasonably well while ensuring that the line passes through the origin. 4.2. inﬂuence of temperature on the thermal conductivity  presents the variation of thermal conductivity of seven pairs of dry specimens in different rock groups with temperature from 40 °c  fit coefficient a for thermal conductivity-temperature curves of seven pairs of specimens in different rock groups. rock type and specimen no. monzogranite (bs05-07) granodiorite (bs06-05) monzogranite (bs15-07) granodiorite (bs16-05) monzogranite (bs18-1-08) granodiorite (bs18-2-05) monzogranite (bs19-1-07) a (10−6) 8.821 5.679 8.394 4.871 6.891 5.728 6.385 r2 0.9830 0.9334 0.9853 0.9289 0.9262 0.9581 0.9933 132 x.g.  / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137\\x0cx.g.  / tectonophysics 683 (2016) 124–137 133 n=2 20 10 axial stress (mpa) 30 40 n=3 20 10 axial stress (mpa) 30 40 50 50 3.4 3.3 3.2 3.1 3.0 2.9 2.8 2.7 2.6 2.5 2.4 c thermal conductivity (w/mk) 50 0 f 2.9 2.8 2.7 2.6 2.5 2.4 thermal conductivity (w/mk) 50 0 n=3 20 10 axial stress (mpa) 30 40 n=3 20 10 axial stress (mpa) 30 40 bs05 bs06 bs15 bs16 bs18-1 bs18-2 bs19-1 bs19-2 y=24.15-24.99e-x (r2=0.9296) 21 18 15 12 0369 i r(%) n=1 20 10 axial stress (mpa) 30 40 50 0.0 0.3 0.9 1.2 0.6 porosity (%) 1.5 1.8 b 3.0 2.9 2.8 2.7 2.6 2.5 2.4 thermal conductivity (w/mk) 50 0 3.2e 3.1 3.0 2.9 2.8 2.7 2.6 2.5 2.4 thermal conductivity (w/mk) 50 0 3.2h 3.1 3.0 2.9 2.8 2.7 2.6 thermal conductivity (w/mk) 50 0 n=3 20 10 axial stress (mpa) 30 40 n=3 20 10 axial stress (mpa) 30 40 n=2 20 10 axial stress (mpa) 30 40 3.0 2.9 2.8 2.7 2.6 2.5 2.4 2.3 2.2 a thermal conductivity (w/mk) 3.0d 2.9 2.8 2.7 2.6 2.5 2.4 2.3 2.2 2.1 2.0 thermal conductivity (w/mk) 3.0g 2.9 2.8 2.7 2.6 2.5 2.4 thermal conductivity (w/mk) 0 0 0 . inﬂuence of axial compression stress on the thermal conductivity of the eight rock groups: (a) bs05, (b) bs06, (c) bs15, (d) bs16, (e) bs18-1, (f) bs18-2, (g) bs19-1 and (h) bs19-2, and variation of the increase rate of the thermal conductivity (r) with rock porosity (i). error bars indicate the standard deviation of the thermal conductivity. n in the figures represents the number of specimen pairs in each rock group. we attempted to relate a with other rock parameters and found that a depended on the magnitude of rock porosity (n), as presented in . the coefficient a varies with porosity n according to the following equation: a ¼ 9:43 − 0:71=n2 ð9þ according to eqs.

(11) is not sensitive to the variation of rock porosity, and is within the range from 0.20 to 0.27 except for the rock group bs19-1. for simplicity, an average value of c = 0.24 obtained from  is used to approximately describe the trend, as shown in b. using eqs. (11)–(12) and the constant coefficient c, an overall fit is made for these rock groups to reproduce the rock porosity-dependent thermal conductivity under different axial stresses. a comparison between individual and overall fit results is presented in . it is found that for each rock group subjected to different compression stresses, the difference of the thermal conductivity values from the individual and overall fits is less than 0.05 w/mk. the good agreement indicates that the established rock porosity-dependent model can capture the nonlinear stress-thermal conductivity relationships of the beishan granitic rocks satisfactorily. 5. discussion one of the findings from the experimental investigations in the previous sections is that the rock porosity has an inﬂuence on the thermal conductivity of the beishan granitic rocks under water saturation, increasing temperature and compression stress conditions, although the porosity of tested rocks is relatively low. it is well known that for low-porosity crystalline rocks, the mineral composition plays an important role in dominating the thermal conductivity. the crystalline rocks are mainly made up of quartz, feldspars, and mafic minerals such as pyroxene, amphibole and biotite, and the content of minerals from these three mineral groups basically determines a rock's thermal conductivity (clauser and huenges, 1995). as mentioned in section 2, a model analysis on a total of 46 thin sections of the rocks was conducted to identify the dominant minerals in the rocks. as listed in , the main minerals of these rocks include quartz, plagioclase, k-feldspar and biotite. among these four minerals, quartz has the highest thermal conductivity (7.69 w/mk) while another three minerals have a thermal conductivity range between 1.70 and 2.29 w/mk (horai, 1971). hence, when the porosity values of the specimens in different rock groups are close to each other, quartz content in the rocks may determine the thermal conductivity. according to the data listed in , a presents the inﬂuence of quartz content on the average thermal conductivity of different rock groups in dry state. it is seen that except for rock groups bs05 and bs15 (which have relatively large porosity values of 1.37% and 0.68%, respectively), thermal conductivity of the rocks appears an increasing trend with increasing quartz content. when the specimens are subjected to compression stresses, the original pores and cracks in the rocks tend to close, and the effective contact areas between mineral grains increase, leading to a significant decay of the porosity effect on the thermal conductivity, especially for rocks with relatively high porosity. on the other hand, the closure of pores and cracks increases the contact opportunity of quartz grains, and hence improves the transportation capability of heat ﬂow in the rocks. under this condition, an obvious increase of the thermal conductivity for all rock groups with increasing quartz content can be observed, as presented in b. 6. conclusions beishan granitic rocks are candidate host rock types for china's hlw repository. in this paper, thermal conductivity characteristics of the beishan granitic rocks have been investigated using the transient plane source (tps) method. the measurement results indicate that for the used eight rock groups with a porosity range from 0.40% to 1.37%, the average thermal conductivity values in the dry state range between 2.412 and 2.812 w/mk. the values under water-saturated condition range from 2.602 to 3.156 w/mk. meanwhile, the effect of water saturation on thermal conductivity presents an increasing trend with an increase of rock porosity. using several mixing models proposed by previous researchers, we found that the hashin–shtrikman mean model showed a reasonably good fit to the experimental data while another three models currently obtained data, a best fitting equation of axial stressdependent thermal conductivity for these rocks can be expressed as (, 2004) k ¼ k0 þ bσ c ð11þ 1 where k0 is the thermal conductivity of the rock at zero stress, σ1 is the axial stress, and b and c are fit coefficients, as listed in . analysis of eq. (11) reveals that the coefficient b plays a critical role in controlling the increasing gradient of the thermal conductivity in the initial loading stage (i.e., crack closure stage). the coefficient c dominantly affects the increasing velocity of the thermal conductivity in the subsequent elastic deformation stage. based on experimental investigations on the thermal conductivity of some rocks subjected to uniaxial stresses using a steady-state apparatus developed by  (2004),  (2008) found that the parameters b and c depended on the magnitude of elastic modulus of the rocks, and subsequently established an elastic modulus dependent model to predict the thermal conductivity values under pressure. unfortunately, in the present study, the elastic moduli of the tested rocks have not been available. therefore, the model proposed by  (2008) cannot be used to fit our test results. according to , we found that the increasing gradients of the thermal conductivities in the initial loading stage were generally large for the rocks with a high porosity such as rock groups bs05 and bs15. hence, the coefficient b is associated with the rock porosity n, i.e., b increases as n increases, as presented in a. an exponential form expression can fit the data reasonably, as follows: b ¼ 0:25 − 0:24 exp −nð þ ð12þ bs05 bs06 bs15 bs16 bs18-1 bs18-2 bs19-1 bs19-2 20 22 24 26 28 30

thermal conductivity of the rocks under the water-saturated condition. future work is demanded to verify the validity of various mixing models using different rock types with a large porosity range. with increasing temperature from 25 °c to 150 °c, the thermal conductivity of the rocks shows a decaying trend and the values at 150 °c range from 5.7% to 8.7% lower than those at room temperature, revealing that the inﬂuence of temperature on the thermal conductivity of the tested rocks is limited. in addition, the thermal conductivity of the rocks increases with increasing compression stress in a nonlinear behavior, and the increase rate of the thermal conductivity increases with an increase of rock porosity. it is found that the effects of compression stress and water saturation on the magnitude of thermal conductivity of the rocks are basically comparable. based on the experimental data, the empirical models considering the inﬂuence of rock porosity have been established for predicting the temperature and compression stress dependent thermal conductivity characteristics of the rocks, and the predictions are found to be in good agreement with experimental results. this study thus emphasizes importance of porosity on thermal conductivity measurements even for low porosity crystalline rocks. when the pores and cracks in the rocks tend to close during compression, quartz content may determine the thermal conductivity, and there exists an increase of the thermal conductivity with increasing quartz content. this is because the closure of pores and cracks increases the contact opportunity of quartz grains, and hence improves the transportation capability of heat ﬂow in the rocks. while the test results provide insights into the thermal conductivity characteristics of beishan granitic rocks, one should be aware of the limitation of this study. because the thermal conductivity of granitic rocks is inﬂuenced by many factors. in order to better understand the thermal conductivity of granitic rocks related to rock characteristics such as rock fabric, grain shape, grain contact and grain size, comprehensive petrographic investigations are recommended in the future. in the meantime, studies should be carried out to understand how the interactions between mineral components affect the thermal conductivity. work is also being conducted to investigate the thermal conductivity of the rocks under coupled thermal-hydro-mechanical conditions. acknowledgments this work has been supported by the china atomic energy authority through the

field: a blind fault captured by thermal–hydraulic simulation maren brehme1 guido bloecher1 mauro cacace1 yustin kamah2 martin sauter3 gue nter zimmermann1 received: 24 november 2015 / accepted: 4 july 2016 / published online: 19 july 2016 ó springer-verlag berlin heidelberg 2016 abstract subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow of reservoirs in active tectonic regions is mainly controlled by permeability of fault zones. therefore, the characterization of fault zones is an important step toward performance assessment of a reservoir. the ﬂuid ﬂow is controlled also by pressure and temperature conditions. in this context, we simulated pressure and temperature fields to elaborate on the inﬂuence of permeability on subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow in the lahendong geothermal reservoir. thermal–hydraulic simulation is performed using a finite element approach. adjusting the permeability through 370 different cases, modeling results converged to the observed data within a misfit range of 0–7 %. the best fitting models identified a deep-seated fault that has previously not been traced at the surface. simulated temperature distribution suggests a prominent convective heat ﬂow, driven by an upward migrating and sw–ne oriented ﬂuid ﬂow. this hydraulic gradient causes a pressure drop along the reservoir. highpressure patterns are used to constrain recharge areas, in addition to infiltration measurements. discharge ﬂow occurs from sw to ne migrating also upward toward the hot springs. in that frame, thermal–hydraulic simulations identified previously unresolved subsurface faults, which & maren brehme

keywords permeable faults \\x01 hydrogeology \\x01 fluid ﬂow \\x01 geothermal field management \\x01 reservoir engineering \\x01 pressure drop introduction it geothermal energy is an essential component to supply future energy demands. requires developing new geothermal sites and improving the performance of existing systems to satisfy continuously growing demand. the productivity of a geothermal field mainly depends on subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow, which in active tectonic regions is controlled by permeability of fault zones (moeck 2014). in that frame, the primary focus is on locating and characterizing faulted areas in geothermal fields. this study employs numerical modeling to allocate and quantify permeability anisotropies and discontinuities, e.g., faults, in order to understand their inﬂuence on subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow in geothermal reservoirs. numerical models have been increasingly used to understand the setup and productivity of geothermal systems. a general overview of geothermal models has been given by o’ (2001). additionally, there are several sites exemplifying similar characteristics as in lahendong. the underground movement of hot and cold ﬂuids has been modeled for geothermal fields in new zealand ( 2014). the kakkonda geothermal site, e.g., consists of two reservoirs at various depths with different ﬂuid properties. there, results from ﬂuid ﬂow analysis show the importance of fractures for ﬂuid transport enhancing the recharge or discharge in the reservoir 123\\x0c1088 page 2 of 11 environ earth sci (2016) 75:1088 ( 1995). generally, faults acting as preferential ﬂuid path ways significantly change the pressure and temperature field in the reservoir ( 2013). models for the seferihisar–balc¸ova field focus on the ﬂuid ﬂow inside of faults. results show an enhanced upward heat transport through ﬂuids from bottom of the geothermal system ( 2011). our test ground is the lahendong geothermal field located in sulawesi, indonesia. the field is owned and operated by p.t. pertamina geothermal energy and hosts a power plant with a production capacity of 80 mwe. there, geothermal exploration started in the early 1970s including geophysical and geohydrochemical approaches. it is a water-dominated magmatic structurally controlled system. faults generally act as across-fault ﬂuid barriers and alongfault ﬂuid conductors ( 2014). as a result, hot springs mainly appear on the top of vertically permeable faults at the surface. available numerous drilling and surface measurements allowed a detailed characterization of the geological and hydrogeological setting of the area (;  2011, 2013, 2014, 2016;  2013). the model presented here is developed for investigating subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow and the permeability distribution including the fault zones in the lahendong geothermal field. below, the geological structure of the field is presented followed by an introduction to the modeling approach. detailed investigation of subsurface permeability distribution is a crucial step for site selection and smart drilling strategies. the numerical simulations presented will provide insight into understanding the subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow considering the hydraulic conductivity of faults. it ensures productive as well as sustainable operation of geothermal fields avoiding risks, such as drilling into non-fractured or cold zones, and targeting highly corroding waters. although the target area is lahendong, the general workﬂow is applicable for other geothermal sites consisting of similar constraints. reservoir characterization hydrogeology the overall driving force for the ﬂuid ﬂow is the sw–ne oriented natural hydraulic gradient in the lahendong geothermal system. the direction of ﬂuid ﬂow varies through the geothermal site due to horizontal partitioning of the reservoir by relatively less permeable fault zones ( 2014). the basic sections are located in the  topographic map of the study area with geological features, water and rock sample locations, and model cross section 123\\x0cenviron earth sci (2016) 75:1088 page 3 of 11 1088 south, in the east, and beneath lake linau. beneath lake linau, the direction of ﬂuid ﬂow is slightly rotated to wsw–ene (). also, types of ﬂuid change from one section to another, e.g., an acidic highly saline-type beneath lake linau and a neutral low saline-type south and east of lake linau (). the impermeable structure across faults prevent the ﬂuids from diluting each other ( 2016). however, faults are rather permeable along the vertical axis, which allows recharge of the system through the faults. rainwater infiltrates at a fault in the sw, at mt. lengkoan, and creek water infiltrates into the normal faults at lake linau (). the hydrothermal system discharges into lake linau and toward the ne, as driven by the hydraulic gradient ( 2014). the fracture network along the area is characterized by strike slip faults and normal faults. the sinistral faults strike n 40° and steeply dip toward the se. left step over on the strike slip faults forms an extension basin in the central study area. normal faults at the extension basin strike nw and dip 70°–80° beneath lake linau ( 2014). lithology lahendong area is mainly characterized by pre-, postand tondano formation of plioto pleistocene age ( 2010). the rocks are typically andesite, volcanic breccia, and tuff. those types have been sampled from borehole cores and used to determine porosity, permeability, and thermal conductivity. effective porosity and matrix permeability have been analyzed using a cylindrical-shaped specimen with a dimension of 5 cm x 5 cm 9 2.5 cm oriented parallel to the coring ( 2016). thermal conductivity has been measured on plain sections of dried cores. the experimental setup consists of a gas permeameter for determining matrix permeability ( 2011), of an helium pycnometry for effective porosity measurements (johnson- 1994) and of an optical scanner for thermal conductivity measurements ( 1999). these parameters have been measured and averaged for the three rock types ( 2016; ). andesite has an effective porosity of 3.7 %, a permeability of 2.1 9 10-14 m2, and a thermal conductivity of 1.8 w m-1 k-1 (dry) or 2.2 w m-1 k-1 (saturated). tuff has a porosity of 7.7 % but the lowest permeability of 2.0 9 10-15 m2 of 1.6 w m-1 k-1 (saturated). volcanic breccia is a permeable layer with an effective porosity of 10.5 %, a permeability of 2.3 9 10-14 m2, and a thermal conductivity of 1.6 w m-1 k-1 (dry) or 2.5 w m-1 k-1 (saturated). reservoir

transport in saturated porous media are derived from conservation principles of linear momentum, mass, and energy (dhi-wasy 2009). details on the software and the parameterization can be found in diersch (2014). the model geometry is a 2d vertical sw–ne trending cross section extending 6 km in horizontal and 3 km in vertical direction. the direction of the profile has been selected to cover all relevant processes in the lahendong geothermal field: it cuts major faults and the production and injection wells, which are used for temperature and pressure calibration. furthermore, to the groundwater ﬂow direction, showing major ﬂuid ﬂow activities. the homogeneous and isotropic geological layers in the model are stratified nearly horizontally. faults in the middle of the model, striking perpendicular to the cross section, dip with 84° toward a cooling pluton beneath lake linau. details on structural and geological components of the modeled region have been presented in  (2014). is parallel it the numerical the mesh used for simulation in feflow consists of 45,264 nodes and 89,320 elements that are denser surrounding the faults because of expected gradients due to parameter contrasts. material properties of 123 elements are permeability, porosity, and thermal conductivity and set according to laboratory measurements (). however, properties of the faults and lake linau are slightly adapted to specific conditions. the definitions for the modeled grids along the faults are as follows: porosity is 30 % and thermal conductivity is 1.8 w m-1 k-1. corresponding grids for lake linau are defined by a porosity of 100 % and a thermal conductivity of 0.6 w m-1 k-1. the model simulates ﬂuid ﬂow and thermal transport in saturated media in steady state. initial values and boundary conditions fluid ﬂow boundary conditions in the model describe groundwater heads and recharge amounts (; ). the hydraulic head at the sw model boundary is 837 m and 500 m at the ne boundary. the sw hydraulic head represents infiltration of surface water into a fault, striking perpendicular to the model. hydraulic head at the ne border is adapted to borehole measurements in that area ( 2014). infiltration into the fault zones at lake linau is described by ﬂuid ﬂux boundary conditions. the quantity is 3.0 9 10-4 m s-1 the sw and 1.3 9 10-6 m s-1 at the ne fault distributed over 40 m fault width. groundwater recharge is set to 412 mm a-1 at the ne top surface (; ). fluid movement in for\\x0cthe model domain is constrained by no-ﬂow boundary at the bottom, recharge through the surrounding fault zones, and the low hydraulic heads in the ne model area. discharge of the system in the central study area is mainly toward lake linau and across the ne model boundary. initial hydraulic head for the whole model domain is 500 m. the heat is 116 °c km-1 at transport boundary conditions are time-invariant, fixed temperatures, and heat ﬂux (; ). thermal gradient the sw model boundary, and the temperature is constant 350 °c at the pluton. temperature of water infiltrating into faults and here mixing with shallow warm groundwater is 70 °c, while surface groundwater recharge is at 28 °c. temperature values are obtained from field and bore log measurements ( 2014). heat ﬂux is set to 100 mw m-2 at the bottom model boundary (; ). this value is fixed based on the studies from  (1998), nagao and uyeda (1995), and  (1998). initial temperature for the model domain is set as 116 °c km-1, according to the local thermal gradient. permeability determination initial values for permeability are defined based on laboratory measurements (). after each simulation run, modeled and measured temperature and pressure values have been compared at indicated observation points. in case of poor matching (errors [10 %), permeability has been adjusted until satisfactory results have been achieved. beneath lake linau, simulation results showed locally strong discrepancies between modeled and measured pressure and temperature (errors [45 %). adjustment of permeability in geological infiltration rates into faults, or hydraulic heads did not lead to acceptable results. only the implementation of strong permeability anisotropy throughout whole depth, i.e., an additional fault, resulted in minimization of errors (0–7 %). implementation has been accomplished by mesh adaptation to ensure appropriate behavior around the fault. by this procedure, permeability anisotropies have been located and characterized in detail throughout the model. layers, in general, defining a direction-dependent permeability improves the data fit rather than using similar permeabilities in all directions. this is probably due to the fractures increasing the permeability mostly in vertical direction. porosity and thermal conductivity remained constant throughout simulation. variation in porosity is negligible because it would directly be reﬂected in permeability, while thermal conductivity differences would only affect conductive heat transport, which is not dominant in the lahendong area ( 1998;  2014). 123 100c measurementa 500borelog ofmodel

to obtain the best fit to the measured data changing the absolute and relative permeability in geological elements. relative permeability refers to different permeabilities in horizontal and vertical direction. as a main result, a blind fault has been recognized beneath lake linau, which has not been known from former studies. simulated pressure and temperature are measured at five selected observation points, which represent boreholes with available bore logs for pressure and temperature. details on data are given in . the model with best data fit, out of 370 different models, is considered to generate the final model developed for lahendong. permeability distribution and identification of a blind fault distribution of permeability patterns in the reservoir has been conceived comparing temperature and pressure data in several wells. especially beneath lake linau, closely located wells show high variations in temperature and pressure. a drop of 100 °c and 18 bar along 300 m distance has been observed between well lhd 24 and lhd 28. models first showed high discrepancies between modeled and measured values in this area. however, after implementing another high anisotropic permeable structure between the observation points, models resulted in satisfactory results. the structure has ten times higher vertical environ earth sci (2016) 75:1088 permeability than horizontal permeability. this structure is assumed to be another fault zone located between two known faults with vertical dip and nw strike. this fault shows no trace at surface, because it is covered by lake linau. generally, modeled permeability distribution in the lahendong reservoir is direction-dependent and overprints the lithology. modeled permeability is generally higher than measured ones in the order of up to four magnitudes. this is due to fracture patterns, which are not detectable at core-sample scale. permeability patterns directly affect subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow and temperature and pressure distribution. permeability in the faulted zones and surroundings is lowest in the study area. especially the middle and ne fault, the shallow area beneath sw lake linau and the deep ne section of the ne fault show low permeabilities between 10-13 and 10-14 m2 (). the area between the middle and ne fault, the deep section ne of the sw fault, the sw fault itself and the whole model area toward the sw and ne boundary show higher permeabilities of 10-10 and 10-12 m2 (). permeability varies not only within the modeled area, but also in vertical and horizontal direction. in faults and the deep reservoir section in the ne, permeability is by a factor of 10 higher in the vertical direction than in the horizontal direction (). in the areas between faults, permeability is in some parts by a factor of 10–100 lower in the vertical direction. in the rest of the model, vertical and horizontal permeability do not differ ().  final adapted permeability and anisotropy distribution throughout

some wells existing in this region are of artesian-type. overpressure releases through high permeable zones beneath lake linau and discharges toward surface. the pressure drop is up to 20 bars across the faults (). temperature distribution temperature distribution along the lahendong geothermal reservoir suggests that convective heat transport is the dominating process in the reservoir rocks. isotherms generally follow the sw–ne oriented ﬂow pattern, the rise and the infiltration of ﬂuids. upwelling of isotherms between the faults verifies water rise toward lake linau. infiltration of cold water causes down welling of isotherms particularly on the northeast section of the model. temperature is locally increased at the bottom of the model surrounding the pluton (). subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow the absolute and horizontal/vertical permeability distribution controls local ﬂuid ﬂow in the lahendong reservoir. the general ﬂuid ﬂow, driven by the natural pressure gradient, is oriented from sw to ne. vertical infiltration occurs at faults at lake linau and at the sw boundary. discharge is across the ne model boundary (). the more detailed ﬂow patterns can be observed with streamlines, which show a ﬂuid ﬂow along highly permeable areas. calculated streamlines describe particle ﬂow within the model domain. a forward calculation shows how infiltrating water at the sw model boundary distributes through the reservoir. the backward calculation shows the source of ﬂuid particles arriving at the ne model boundary (). patterns show that hot groundwater ﬂows toward the faults beneath lake linau, where the ﬂuid ﬂow is disturbed by a rise in temperature and vertically high permeable layers. this causes a rise of groundwater in this model area (red forward streamlines in ). at the same time, cold water infiltrates into high permeable areas and distributes over the ne model domain (blue backward streamlines in ). it is clearly seen that the composition of the ne reservoir domain is dominated by coldwater infiltration into faults, while the production areas are characterized by hot water ﬂow (). discussion investigation of subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow in geothermal reservoirs is crucial for sustainable exploitation avoiding drilling into less productive areas. subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow might be locally inﬂuenced by fault zones or physical 123\\x0c1088 page 8 of 11 environ earth sci

infiltrating cold water ﬂowing towards ne model boundary properties of water (i.e. viscosity). the inﬂuence of these parameters on the ﬂuid ﬂow has been investigated in lahendong geothermal reservoir using hydraulic–thermal simulations. simulation results show the detailed permeability distribution in the reservoir including location of an additional fault zone. matching of measured and simulated temperature and pressure has been used as a tool for resolving the permeability distribution. temperature and pressure have been iteratively determined at several observation points (). generally, modeled values are in good agreement with observed ones (). nevertheless, some observation points give slightly different values for both pressure and temperature (lhd 4 and lhd 7) or only temperature (lhd 24). this is probably due to the complicated ﬂow processes or strong small-scale structural variation in fractured and faulted areas. furthermore, density variations, which could have not been included into simulation due to high temperatures, could cause variation of ﬂuid pressure. however, the average deviation of simulated pressure and temperature is 1 %. implemented model parameters are porosity, permeability, and heat conductivity. from those parameters, only permeability has been tested in a specific range during simulation. the inﬂuence of porosity and heat conductivity on ﬂuid ﬂow is negligible due to dominating convective heat ﬂow ( 1998). values implemented in the model are based on measured permeabilities, which represent matrix permeability of rocks. the measured matrix permeability, representing permeability in horizontal direction, is 1.5 9 10-14 m2 on 123 average, which remains within typical permeability range for fractured igneous rocks (schoen 2004). permeability for volcanic breccias ranges typically between 3 9 10-15 and 5 9 10-12 m2 and tuff permeabilities range between 7 9 10-17 and 7 9 10-12 m2 (klavetter and peters 1987). in the wairakei geothermal field, simulating the impermeable layers resulted in permeabilities of 10-18 and 10-14 m2, in horizontal and vertical axis, respectively (mercer and faust 1979). however, permeability in reservoir rocks might be locally increased due to fracture formation. it might also be decreased due to alteration and sealing in faults. in lahendong, modeled permeability can be up to four magnitudes higher than measured ones in faulted areas. this is caused by fractures, which are not detectable in core scale. moreover, in fault cores, it is by a factor of 10 higher in vertical direction than in horizontal direction. however, in areas between faults (fault gauge), permeability is in some parts by a factor of 10–100 lower in the vertical direction. adaptation of permeability ensures a fit to measured temperature and pressure data. permeability in fractured areas is the main factor inﬂuencing subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow and temperature distribution in the lahendong reservoir area. subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow is driven by local hydraulic heads, which show high variations at different sections of the study area. consequently, convective heat distribution leads to high temperature variation along the reservoir. these phenomena are observed in lahendong as well as comparable fields. in new mexico, water level drops of 30–100 m are observed across (haneberg 1995). high several

measured temperature and pressure at selected observation points. well specifications and measured data from  (2014) temperature drops and upwelling of isotherms indicate that fault zones control the ﬂuid ﬂow in the lake long and valentine fields, usa (hooper 1991). the analysis of ﬂuid pressure differences at the alpine fault, new zealand, allowed to characterize the change in permeability between hanging and footwall blocks ( 2012). in summary, high pressure or temperature gradients are indicators for ﬂuid barriers between observation points. in other words, reservoir sections of different properties are separated by horizontally less permeable faults. in lahendong, most significant ﬂuid barriers are faults to the sw and to the ne of lake linau. across these barriers, the pressure drops up to 20 bars. a similar pattern has been measured in bore logs beneath lake linau, where no surface trace of a fault had been observed in former studies. however, only by implementing another fault, modeled and measured values could have been adapted. the recently identified fault zone beneath lake linau remains under lake water and therefore is only traceable by this kind of reservoir modeling. additionally to fault identification, the internal structure of known fault zones has been understood in detail. the ne fault, i.e., shows a displacement at 2 km depth. the detailed trend has been understood by permeability adaptation in this area. due to low permeability in horizontal direction in the faults, ﬂuids propagate mostly vertically toward the hot springs at surface. it also allows surface water to infiltrate into the reservoir in case the pressure within the fault zone is low enough (). this vertical ﬂuid movement eventually controls the temperature distribution in the reservoir. upward migration of deep hot water increases the temperature, while infiltration of cold surface water causes local drop of temperature. in summary, the most important factors inﬂuencing the reliability of numerical reservoir models are absolute and different horizontal and vertical permeability. however, a permeability adaptation has been done for each geological layer; the vertical permeability anomalies are overprinting those layers and are constraining the regional groundwater ﬂow. those permeabilities of fractures directly inﬂuence the productivity of the reservoir ( 2013). therefore, their permeability characteristics should be investigated in detail. in a previous study, a numerical model for the lahendong site has been set up in tough2 and aimed at forecasting the reservoir behavior during exploitation until the year 2036. with a production of 60 mwe, it predicts a pressure drop of 10 bars. however, the forecast results are uncertain due to lack of measured pressure draw down data (yani 2006). accordingly, the next steps of the presented study should include a realistic production and injection scenario in order reservoir exploitation. furthermore, chemical characteristics could be considered to achieve reliable production setups, because hydrochemical processes play an important role in the lahendong reservoir ( 2016). presented models from this study provide important information on ﬂuid ﬂow in the water-dominated lahendong reservoir. however, additional the two-phase ﬂow models of to support sustainable\\x0c1088 page 10 of 11 environ earth sci (2016) 75:1088 lahendong area are in progress to understand the inﬂuence of steam driven ﬂuid ﬂow in this high-temperature system. conclusion the primary focus of this study is to understand the inﬂuence of fault zones and permeability patterns on subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow in geothermal reservoirs. the ﬂuid ﬂow mainly depends on rock and fault zone permeability. these processes have been considered in numerical models, which simulate local temperature and pressure conditions. the initial reservoir conditions, which refers to the case before production starts. models are developed based on the conceptual models of the study area, which explain reservoir geometry, geological structures, temperature, and hydraulic conditions. temperature and pressure well-logs have been used for model calibration. the numerical models represent vertical and horizontal ﬂuid ﬂow is mainly controlled by fault permeability. this characteristic is used to simulate different reservoir sections, and vertical ﬂuid rise toward the surface. by stepwise adaptation of permeability fields, based on observed temperature and pressure gradients, an additional blind fault zone can be identified beneath lake linau. temperature and pressure significantly drop across that ﬂuid barrier. this behavior has been observed in comparable fields in the usa as well. the overall shape of ﬂuid ﬂow direction trends in a sw–ne direction. main recharge occurs by infiltration of surface water into the faults, especially in the southwest and near to lake linau. discharge is enhanced in highly fractured areas toward lake linau. vertical permeability of faults allows ﬂuids rising toward the hot springs at surface. results show that permeability has to be considered for simulation of a geothermal system. the geothermal system is mainly controlled by ﬂuid ﬂow in fractures/faults depending on temperature and pressure conditions. the locally modified ﬂuid ﬂow can considerably inﬂuence the productivity of a geothermal field. results also guide reservoir management in case of a potential for field extension, as performed in lahendong. acknowledgments the authors acknowledge the continuous support within

keywords: geothermal energy granite high temperature stress-strain response triaxial acoustic xrd geothermal heat has now been identified as an effective renewable energy source due to severe environmental impacts created by conventional fossil usage on global climatic change. however, its wide application has been limited due to the lack of knowledge, particularly of the geothermal conditions of reservoir rocks at elevated temperatures and pressures. such high temperatures and pressures possibly alter the mechanical properties of reservoir rocks due to the associated micro-structural and mineralogical alterations of the rock mass, which are an important attribute for wellbore stability and stimulation of geothermal reservoirs for safe and effective geothermal energy extraction. this study therefore investigates the stress-strain behaviour under in-situ stress and temperature conditions by conducting a series of high-pressure, high-temperature tri-axial experiments on australian strathbogie granite under four different confining pressures (10, 30, 60, 90 mpa) and four different temperatures (rt, 100, 200, 300 ◦c). the effect of temperature on the mechanical behaviour of rock specimens was studied under tri-axial conditions and the corresponding fracture propagation behaviour was observed using an advanced acoustic emission (ae) system. the corresponding micro-structure alteration in granite was observed using sem analysis. according to the findings, increasing temperature leads to an initial increment in reservoir rock strength and shear parameters followed by reduction, and the trend is aligned with the crack formation pattern of the rock mass. this was further confirmed by the sem analysis, according to which the rock micro-structure is subject to only minor changes at relatively low temperatures and higher temperatures cause micro-cracks to develop along the rock mass grain boundaries. furthermore, the conventional mohr-coulomb criteria failed to model the stress-strain response of rock under geothermal reservoir conditions, and was therefore modified for the corresponding in-situ conditions. © 2016

involve finding vast blocks of “hot rocks” with fracture systems. such rocks can be used to generate electricity. in this process, water is first injected and circulated through the fractures in the geothermal reservoirs and eventually pumped back to the surface as steam. however, the exploration of geothermal resources has become a challenge to engineers and geologists, due to the high temperature and stress environments in geothermal reservoirs. for this reason, laboratory experiments conducted under high pressure and temperature conditions (geothermal conditions) can assist in providing\\x0cw.g.p.  / geothermics 65 (2017) 44–59 45 basic predictions. a large number of laboratory experiments has therefore been conducted since 1970 to investigate the inﬂuence of high pressure and temperature on rock in relation to geothermal heat extraction (, 2016), deep geological disposal of nuclear waste (paquet and franc¸ ois, 1980), deep mining (wawersik and hannum, 1980) and geological co2 storage (, 2014). the mechanical behaviour of reservoir rocks is significantly inﬂuenced by elevated temperatures, because they cause the micro-structure of the rock mass to be altered through thermal expansion, the development of new micro-cracks, extending and/or widening the existing micro cracks and various mineralogical alterations. rock strength-deformation criteria change with temperature, and some rock mechanical properties, such as compressive strength, tensile strength, elastic modulus, cohesive strength and friction angle, decrease with increasing temperature (heuze, 1983; , 2008). however, such alterations are also affected by the confinement applying on the rock mass, and confining pressure causes the suppression of thermal cracks and the extension/widening of existing micro-cracks. this results in further alteration of the rock mass mechanical properties, resulting in changing failure modes (mogi, 1966). studies have identified the transition of rock failure mode from brittle to ductile with increasing confinement. however, this transition is diverse due to the different mineralogical compositions and grain boundaries in different rocks (, 2001; wong, 1982). although many studies have been conducted to investigate the temperature-dependent mechanical behaviour of reservoir rocks, most experiments have been conducted in unconfined environments (, 2015; , 2014). pre-heating the specimens to the corresponding temperature ranges and testing at room temperatures has been frequently done (bauer and johnson, 1979; , 2008), but the method is not reliable, as geothermal reservoirs experience continuous thermal stresses. such limitations have occurred mainly due to the limited number of appropriate test facilities available to simulate the stress and temperature conditions of actual geothermal reservoirs. although some studies have analytically and numerically evaluated the mechanical properties of rocks under high temperatures and pressures (chester and higgs, 1992; , 2013; , 2016), to date none has captured the stress-strain behaviour and failure criteria of rocks over a wide range of confining pressures and temperatures, particularly for australian granite. however, the thermo-elastic response and appropriate failure criteria are essential inputs for many engineering applications under high pressures and temperatures, including geothermal extraction applications. this study therefore intends to fill this gap, and it is hoped it will make an important contribution to many deep underground applications. 2. methodology 2.1. tested material granite is an abundant crystalline rock in the earth with medium to coarse grains which was formed as a result of the slow cooling of magma. granite therefore has abundant radioactive elements (k, th, and u). such elements bring elevated geothermal gradients to deep granite reservoirs, which therefore have ideal conditions as geothermal reservoirs. the mineralogical composition of granite mainly consists of quartz, feldspar, plagioclase and biotite, and small amounts of muscovite, amphibole, hornblende and opaque (, 2008). for the present study, samples were collected from the strathbogie batholith, which is a composite granitoid intrusion body spreading over more than 1500 km2 in 150 km north-east from melbourne ().

(a) dilatancy and failure by strain softening under relatively low confining pressures and (b) failure by strain hardening under elevated confining pressures, and a transitional regime may be observed at intermediate pressures. these transitional failure modes have been referred to as “quasi-brittle”, and complex localized features such as conjugate shear bands can be observed under such conditions (, 2001; , 2004). by visual inspection of the post-failure samples, important information about the alteration of the granite failure mechanism with confining pressures and temperatures can be identified. postfailure images () were therefore collected after each test. according to the post-failure images, specimens that failed at 10–60 mpa confining pressures mainly failed by shear localization along an inclined macroscopic shear band with a single shear zone across each sample. however, samples tested at higher confinements of 90 mpa and 120 mpa (at 100 ◦c) exhibited strain hardening characteristics after achieving the peak stress, and several conjugate shear bands could be observed on the cylindrical sample surface, instead of the single shear band observed earlier. this characteristic was significant at 120 mpa confining pressure. however, it should be noted that only one test was conducted at 120 mpa confinement, because at such high confining pressures the corresponding failure load of granite exceeds the bottom pedestal’s load-bearing capacity. further, a progressive reduction was observed in the failure plane angle with respect to the minor principal stress direction with increasing confining pressure, which implies a reduction in friction angle, possibly due to the greater quasi-brittle behaviour that was shown by granite samples at higher confining pressures (, 2001). 3.2. effect of temperature and confining pressure on mechanical properties of strathbogie granite  illustrates the inﬂuence of temperature on the deviatoric stress of the tested granite under each confinement. as the figure shows, the inﬂuence of confinement is more significant than that of temperature in the temperature range considered here. wong and brace (1979) confirm that at lower confining pressures considerable thermal cracking occurs at relatively low temperatures. if thermal cracking is responsible for the reduction in failure strength, a sharp reduction in deviatoric stress with increasing temperature (with suppression of thermal cracks) should be exhibited under unconfined pressure condition. however, based on the experimental results, under unconfined conditions, up to 100 ◦c, 17.6% of increment in deviatoric stress is followed by 2.5% and 10.5% reductions at 200 ◦c and 300 ◦c, respectively. however, when confinement was applied, strength reduction was initiated after higher temperature of 200 ◦c, mainly due to the inhibition of a thermal cracks by induced compressive force. thermal cracking is therefore an important strength property alteration mechanism in reservoir rocks under certain confining pressure conditions. a clear inﬂuence of temperature on deviatoric stress at any depth or confinement can be observed, and increasing the temperature from room temperature to 200 ◦c causes an increment in deviatoric stress, and further increasing of temperature to 300 ◦c causes a slight reduction in it. this is because the thermal expansion which occurs with increasing temperature causes the reduction of .

which is only 0.19% of maximum measurement. during the load application, the axial strain was measured using linear variable differential transducers (lvdts) attached to the ram of the load cell ((a)). an acoustic emission (ae) system was also employed in the testing of samples to record the data related to the fracturing process. the ae system adopted was a peripheral component interconnection (pci) system with a nominal resolution frequency of 500 khz. during the experiments, two sensors were attached to either side of the loading shaft and with the external amplifiers, which generated low frequency acoustic waves with the fracturing of the sample. in addition, possible micro-structural and mineralogical changes that occurred during thermal and confinement effects were checked using sem analyses. 3. results and discussion 3.1. the overall stress-strain response the inﬂuence of temperature on the stress-strain behaviour of the tested granite was considered first

characteristics were relatively small up to 500 ◦c and beyond that an accelerated downward trend was identified. furthermore, wider localized zones were observed at high temperatures in the post-failure images. however, these studies were conducted at wider temperature ranges (up to 700 ◦c and 900 ◦c, respectively) and the researchers therefore did not pay close attention to reservoir rock behaviour under relatively low geothermal temperature ranges (<300 ◦c). this was the focus of the present study, according to which there is an initial strengthening and stiffening in granite with increasing temperature at low temperatures (up to 200 ◦c), and increasing the temperature beyond a certain value causes a gradual reduction in failure stress with increasing temperature. elastic modulus is an important mechanical property of any reservoir rock, and describes the brittle characteristics of the rock mass. it is therefore often used to evaluate many in-situ stress applications, including wellbore stability, fracturing possibility and tectonic stress distribution (heard and page, 1982). the temperature-dependent brittle properties (elastic modulus) of the tested granite were then evaluated. the elastic region of each stress-strain curve was used to calculate the temperature and pressure-dependent young’s moduli (e) and the results are shown in . the axial strain was measured using lvdts attached to the loading ram with a linearity ±0.1% f.s (full scale) (±0.0075 mm) and infinite resoluerror of tion (no hysteresis). an increment of the modulus of strathbogie granite with increasing temperature up to 200 ◦c can be observed, and further increase of temperature (to 300 ◦c) causes the elastic modulus to be slightly reduced for any confinement. this trend is\\x0ca ‘brittle’ or general increment in elastic modulus with increasing confinement can be observed until 90 mpa, and a further increase of confinement (to 120 mpa) reduces the young’s modulus considerably. with increasing confining stress additional plastic deformation occurs, exhibiting strain-hardening characteristics in granite under high confinements. however, within the range of the experiments conducted (10 mpa–120 mpa) it cannot be definitively identified as a ’ductile’ regime. however, the strain-hardening behaviour observed at 120 mpa indicates transitional characteristics and this can be identified as ‘quasi-brittle’ behaviour (, 2001). the initial young’s modulus reduction with increasing confinement was observed by heard and page (1982), who conducted tests up to 55 mpa confining pressure. however, the latter behaviour was not observed by these researchers. interestingly, according to the research literature, at low temperatures (<200 ◦c) some granite types are more temperature-sensitive, while in contrast, some granites are more temperature-sensitive at high temperatures. the initial strength enhancement is more significant for coarse-grained granites and granodiorite than for fine-grained granites. for example, according to heard and page (1982), stripa granite is more sensitive to temperature at relatively low temperatures (<200 ◦c), and westerly granite is more sensitive to temperature at high temperatures (>200 ◦c). such contradictory behaviours may occur in granite due to the different grain size distributions, grain orientations, mineralogical compositions and heterogeneity of different granite types. this indicates the importance of studying the mineralogical composition and microstructural inﬂuence of granites on such on temperature-dependent strength variations. 3.3. effect of temperature on shear strength parameters of strathbogie granite  illustrates the variation of deviatoric stress of the tested granite with confining pressure for each temperature. the figure shows that increasing confinement causes the granite’s deviatoric stress to increase non-linearly and gradually come to a steady state. this is consistent with similar previous studies, which have clearly shown the enhancement of rock strength with increasing confinement, and the increasing rate is reduced with increasing confining pressure (barton, 2013; , 2011). this is because at low confining pressures there is a high dilation potential. therefore, the ability to open rock micro-cracks is high, resulting in higher friction angles. however, this dilation potential and the corresponding tendency for micro-cracks to open are suppressed with increasing confinement, resulting in lower friction angles at higher confining pressures. therefore, the failure mechanism of the rocks shifts from brittle to ductile with increasing confinement, changing the shape of the mohr-coulomb failure envelope, and according to barton (1976), at critical confining pressure the mohr-coulomb failure envelope reaches a zero gradient. this has also been shown by hoek (1983). the present study has clearly identified this rock behaviour in the mohr-coulomb failure envelopes developed for each temperature condition (refer to ). according to , the traditional linear mohr-coulomb criteria are applicable only in the brittle region of the failure envelope, and at higher confinew.g.p.  / geothermics 65 (2017) 44–59 consistent with the temperature-dependent strength behaviour of the granite described above. the reason for the initial elastic module increment may be that the specimen becomes more brittle at the initial temperature ranges due to thermally-induced volumetric expansion and the associated pore volume reduction. the later slight reduction of young’s modulus with increasing temperature exhibits an enhancement in ductile behaviour (quasi-brittle characteristics) with further increase of temperature. this is possibly due to the increased crack density caused by the induced thermal crack development and the related weakening of the granite. 600 500 400 300 200 100 0 50 σ1-σ3(mpa) 0 100 temperature (ºc) 200

angle and (b) cohesion with different temperatures (considering linear region of the mohr coulomb failure envelope). the latter positive effect of temperature on cohesion, according to wong and brace (1979), increasing the temperature to an extreme value may cause weakening of the grain boundaries, dependent on the anisotropy of the rock matrix (due to potentially existing distinct mineral compounds in granite those may contain different thermo-elastic moduli and this may causes to generate different internal stresses with heating). according to wong and brace (1979), increasing the temperature causes the induction of thermal cracks in the rock mass due to the associated generation of internal stresses (eq. (2)): (2) e(cid:4)˛(cid:4)t = \\u2434 where, e, \\x01␣, \\x01t is the matrix young’s modulus, difference of thermal expansion coefficient of distinct mineral and temperature difference, respectively. when the internal stress (given by eq. (2)) exceeds the crack closure pressure with increasing temperature, thermal cracks form and further increase of temperature provides the surface energy required for the propagation of the initiated crack (, 2007). this results in alteration of the grain-tograin contacts in the rock matrix, which leads to reduced cohesion at higher temperatures. in the case of the variation of friction angle with increasing temperature, the granite friction angle appears to remain steady up to around 100 ◦c (52◦) and then slightly increases with increasing temperature (54◦ at 200 and 300 ◦ c, respectively). the friction between grain-to-grain contacts may be altered by the thermally-induced micro-structural modifications. however, this effect on grain contact is expected to be smaller at relatively low temperatures, resulting in relatively steady friction angle with increasing temperature at lower temperatures. however, a slight ments non-linearity must be taken into account. in addition to the confinement, according to this study, increasing temperature also alters the failure envelope of granite. an initial increment in deviatoric stress with increasing temperature can be observed up to 200 ◦c and further increase of temperature (to 300 ◦c) causes it to be slightly reduced. the temperature-dependent shear parameters of granite were investigated next, and the shear parameters can be obtained from the mohr-coulomb failure envelope. as suggested by  (2011), the mohr-coulomb parameters (cohesion and friction angle) were calculated using eq. (1), taking into account the linear region of the obtained mohr-coulomb failure envelope (considering only smaller confining stresses, up to 30 mpa) for each temperature condition to obtain the temperature-dependent shear strength parameters ().

(continued) enhancement in friction angle with increasing temperature can be seen, probably due to the increased resistance of mineral particles to external deformation as a result of the thermally-induced energy in the mineral particles. however, compared with cohesion, the temperature dependency on friction angle is relatively insignificant within the temperature region considered here. initial enhancement in shear parameters in sandstone with increasing temperature has been observed by  (2015) at relatively low temperature regions, and these researchers observed reduction in friction angle from 33.02◦ to 31.93◦ and an increment a in cohesion from 61.47 mpa to 66.44 mpa with increasing temperature from 25 ◦c to 100 ◦c. further, bauer and johnson (1979) observed around 10% reduction in cohesion and 40% reduction in friction angle in westerly granite with increasing temperature from room temperature to 300 ◦c, and  (1979) observed 7% reduction in cohesion and a 38% reduction in friction angle a with increasing temperature from room temperature to 400 ◦c and 300 ◦c, respectively. however, the variation of shear strength parameters with increasing temperature at relatively low temperatures (<300 ◦c) was not considered in the above studies. the observed initial shear strengthening may be due to the inhibition of micro-crack propagation by the plasticity mechanism which occurs at crack tips (duclos and paquet (1991)) at low temperatures. with further increment of temperature, the reduction of shear strength parameters can be expected, due to the thermal weakening of the rock micro-structure. furthermore, according to the sem studies conducted by  (2007), large local plastic deformations and extremely rough cleavage fractures occur at relatively low temperatures. moreover, due to the volume expansion, the distance between the interfaces of the individual minerals decreases with the enhancement of their mutual attraction, and the strength of the bonds increases (dmitriev, 1972). both of these phenomena can be considered to explain the stress strengthening of granite under relatively low temperatures when subjected to confining pressures. 3.4. analysis of fracturing behaviour using ae technology acoustic emission (ae) detection technology is a powerful nondestructive tool to study crack propagation processes in brittle materials, including the stages of crack initiation, growth and crack damage (lockner, 1993). when a brittle material is under stress, strain energy is released during the development of new cracks or the widening of existing cracks. this energy is released in the form of elastic stress waves from the crack tips, and can be captured and amplified by an ae system. ae detection technology has therefore been widely used in a number of previous studies to understand the crack development mechanism in brittle materials (chang and lee, 2004; , 2000; , 2005). by incorporating the crack propagation pattern into the stressstrain relationship of the cracking material, the crack development process can be divided into several stages. hoek and bieniawski (1965) divided crack formation into five main stages: crack closure, crack initiation, secondary cracking, crack coalescence and crack damage. later,  (2008) and  (2015) incorporated stress-strain curves into cumulative ae counts/energy and strain plots. in the crack propagation process, with the gradual increment of loading on brittle materials, most pre-existing cracks are first closed, releasing an insignificant number of ae counts. this initial crack closure period is followed by the stable crack propagation period, which can be identified by the release of gradual ae energy increments. further increment of loading causes an exponential increase in ae energy, indicating an unstable crack propagation period with failure approaching. the crack closure threshold ((cid:2)cc) is defined as the stress threshold at which the initial ae counts are identified. anan initial increment in cumulative ae\\x0c54 w.g.p.  / geothermics 65 (2017) 44–59 counts can be seen at the crack initiation ((cid:2)ci) threshold, and the cumulative ae counts starts exponential growth at the crack damage ((cid:2)cd) threshold. the region between the crack closure threshold and the crack initiation threshold is generally defined as the stable crack closure region, where linear elastic deformation occurs. the region between the crack initiation threshold and the crack damage threshold is defined as the stable crack propagation region, and the region between the crack damage threshold and sample failure is identified as the unstable crack propagation region. the application of compressive loading fails rocks through either shear localization (brittle regime) or cataclastic ﬂow, and the surrounding conditions, such as temperatures and pressures, may cause a homogenous plastic ﬂow. according to existing studies, axial intra-granular cracking and shear rupturing of cemented grain contacts can be observed before failure in brittle regimes, and grain crushing and pore collapse can be identified before failure in cataclastic ﬂow regimes (, 1996). according to  (1997), the development of local stress concentrations leads to the initiation of many intra-granular micro-cracks in the rock mass, and the crack density increases with increasing deviatoric stress and tends to merge on reaching the peak stress, resulting in strain softening and shear localization. these damage processes are clearly identified by the intense ae activities in the field (chang and lee, 2004). ae technology was therefore used to investigate the progressive fracturing behaviour in strathbogie granite under tri-axial conditions.  illustrates the cumulative ae events with axial stress at various pressures and temperatures for the tested specimens. the corresponding variations of deviatoric stress against strain are also included in the same plots to identify the stress thresholds for crack closure, crack initiation and crack damage (). the very high ae counts in strathbogie granite at dilatancy in the pre-failure stage are due to the fact that ae waves generate when the local shear stress concentration at a grain contact is sufficiently high to rupture the grain boundaries, and frictional slips and grain rotations may occur once the grain contacts have lost their cohesion. in the present study, crack threshold ratios were defined to identify the temperature and pressure-dependent crack propagation in the tested granite as follows, and  shows the crack propagation stress threshold ratios of granite specimens tested at various confining pressures and temperatures. crack closure stress threshold = deviatoric stress at crack closure stress deviatoric stress at failure ((cid:2)cc) crack initiation stress threshold = deviatoric stress at crack initiation stress deviatoric stress at failure ((cid:2)ci) crack damage stress threshold = deviatoric stress at crack damage stress ((cid:2)cd) deviatoric stress at failure according to the results, the beginning of crack damage occurs at earlier stages of deviatoric loading for higher confining pressures. however, the crack damage stress increases with increasing confinement due to the inﬂuence of confining pressure on thermal crack development and the suppression of the extension/widening of existing micro-cracks. according to , in the temperature range considered here, three tendencies can be identified with increasing confining pressure: increase of the elastic deformation region, decrease of the stable crack propagation region, and increase of the unstable crack propagation region. the crack initiation stress threshold also progressively increases with increasing confining pressure, which can be attributed to the fact that the brittle behaviour of rock specimens at lower confining pressures changes to quasi-brittle behaviour with increasing confining pressure. this is because the suppression of micro-crack development is less at low confining pressures, and therefore sudden failures mostly occur, and the beginning of crack initiation occurs at earlier stages of deviatoric loading at high confining pressures due to the higher normal stress acting on micro-cracks, resulting in limited progression of cracking before failure. in relation to the temperature effect, increasing the temperature causes an initial increment in the crack propagation stress threshold, followed by a slight reduction for all the temperature conditions considered. for example, at 30 mpa confinement, the crack damage stress threshold ratios increased by around 6.8%, 10.5% with increasing temperature from room temperature to 100 and 200 ◦c, respectively, and reduced by around 4.0% when the temperature increased to 300 ◦c. this implies that at low temperatures a suppressed micro-crack development mechanism is dominant, and increasing the temperature causes crack damage to occur at earlier loading stages. interestingly, at 60 mpa confinement the crack damage stress threshold ratio increased by around 4.9%, 5.4%, 2.6% with increasing temperature from room to 100, 200 and 300 ◦c, respectively. this exhibits the cumulative effect of temperature and pressure micro-crack development in the rock mass. at relatively low temperatures, micro-crack propagation may be inhibited by the thermally-induced plasticity mechanism which occurs at crack tips and the increased bonding strength through thermally-induced rock matrix expansion (which increases crack stress thresholds). however, further increase of temperature creates thermally-induced cracks and causes the grain boundary cracks to widen, resulting in early crack damage. further, with the inﬂuence of confinement, micro-crack development is suppressed, causing a relatively low increment of crack damage stress threshold ratios at higher confinements. 3.5. corresponding alterations in granite micro-structure a comprehensive micro-structural analysis was also performed to identify the interior correspondences of the above-described temperature-dependent mechanical behaviour of granite. sem and optical microscopic analyses were performed on thin sections of granite specimens at various temperatures: room temperature (20 ◦c), pre-heated (72 hours) to 200 ◦c and 400 ◦c (). these temperatures were selected to identify the microstructural behaviour at 200 ◦c, at which the highest strength increment was observed, and 400 ◦c, at which clear thermally-induced rock mass weakening was observed. a specimen at room temperature was used as a control. based on optical microscope imaging, mineralogical assembling in the granite specimen could be identified by the colour and texture of each of the mineral assemblages. further, a detailed sem study was performed using scanning electron imaging (sei) and bsei back-scatter electron imaging (bsei) techniques. bsei images taken at low magnifications clearly show different mineral assemblages and grain boundaries (see ). using energy-dispersive x-ray (edx) technology with aztec oxford instruments, chemical component mapping was generated in each specimen, and each mineral was identified qualitatively. the bright colour images observed in edx images indicate higher concentration (higher energy dispersion) while dark colour areas indicate lower concentration (lower energy dispersion). based on the spectrum of each point (point id), the corresponding mineral was identified and a map spectrum provided overall elements available for each specimen. according to  and 14, there are clear mineralogical assembling in the granite specimens, mainly with quartz, kfeldspar and plagioclase. the heating of granite up to 200 ◦c temperature has not caused any significant thermally-induced micro-cracks (in addition to the pre-existing faults and grain boundaries) and almost all grain boundaries remain intact. however, further heating of granite to the higher temperature of 400 ◦c caused the induction of some micro-cracks, mainly

quartz feldspar boundaries. however, only a few grain\\x0c56 w.g.p.  / geothermics 65 (2017) 44–59 . optical microscopic and sem images of thin sections of strathbogie granite (a) at room temperature; (b) pre-heated to 100 ◦c (c) pre-heated to 400 ◦c. boundaries have been partially parted and a significant number of grain boundaries appear to remain intact up to this temperature. furthermore, based on the edx mapping, it was confirmed that intra-granular cracks are mainly initiated along the feldspar and quartz minerals. intragranular cracks were mainly observed in larger crystals (crystals greater than 0.5 mm) and smaller crystals remained un-parted even at 400 ◦c. for strathbogie granite, thermally-induced intra-granular micro-cracks seem to play a significant role at relatively low temperatures, probably due to the presence of relatively high k feldspar and biotite contents. similar observations have been reported in bauer and johnson’s (1979) study conducted for charcoal granite, where intra-granular microcracks predominantly occur compared to grain boundary cracks. the sem analysis is also consistent with this finding, which exhibits inhibition of micro-crack development followed by micro-cracking at relatively high temperatures. the crack propagation process in any rock mass is largely inﬂuenced by the mineralogical composition, because cracks normally propagate through weaker planes of the rock mass. since granite is an igneous type of rock, two main types of thermallyinduced cracking modes can be identified: inter-granular and intragranular. the amount of inter-granular or intra-granular cracking is dependent on the stress state, rock type and mineralogy of the rock mass. inter-granular cracks occur along grain boundaries, pre-existing faults and micro-cracks of the rock, while intragranular cracks occur through weaker mineralogical constituents (kranz, 1983). for example, k feldspar and biotite are weaker mineralogical constituents due to their large crystals (>10 mm), as crystals greater than 2–3 mm in size are generally defined as weaker mineralogical constituents compared to equi-dimensional small crystals like quartz (homand-etienne and houpert, 1989). based on experimental results, intra-granular cracking is highly temperature-dependent due to the temperature dependent dislocations in the rocks. this is because different mineralogical components have different thermo-elastic moduli and thermal conductivities (kranz, 1983; , 2008). these observations suggest that micro-cracking in granite is highly temperature dependent, as evidenced by the previously observed initial strength gain followed by slight strength reduction with increasing temperature in the tested granite. however, this shows that granite needs to be heated to a sufficient temperature to cause thermal cracks in it and therefore, heating to a lower temperature may only cause a strength gain through the thermal expansion of the rock matrix. this is consistent with the results of bauer and johnson (1979). the mechanical properties of charcoal granite in their study remained relatively steady until 200 ◦c, and westerly granite exhibited a significant thermal dependency, even at relatively low temperatures (<200 ◦c). in homand-etienne and houpert (1989) study, the variation of uni-axial compressive strength of both semones and remiremont granites is insignificant until 400 ◦c, followed by significant reductions at higher temperatures. these results indicate the dependency of mineralogical composition and grain size distribution on the temperature dependent mechanical behaviour in various types of granites. however,\\x0cw.g.p.  / geothermics 65 (2017) 44–59 57 . bse images of strathbogie granite with edx mapping:

different confining pressures (10, 30, 60, 90 mpa) and four different temperatures (rt, 100, 200, 300 ◦c), simulating various geothermal reservoir conditions. the following conclusions can be drawn: mechanical behaviour of the tested granite is inﬂuenced by both reservoir depth and temperature, and the depth effect is much greater than the temperature effect. granite located at relatively smaller depths appears to fail through shear localization and increasing depth may cause this to change to ductile failure through strain hardening. a progressive enhancement in stress threshold with increasing confining pressure is observed in strathbogie granite. such behaviours exhibit greater strength and lower brittle characteristics in granite located at greater depths. increasing of temperature causes granite’s strength to be enhanced up to a certain temperature (around 200 ◦c for strathbogie granite) through the possible thermal expansion of the rock matrix and further increasing of temperature may cause it to weaken by inducing thermal cracks. this was confirmed by the micro-structural analysis, which did not reveal any noticeable amount of thermally-induced micro-cracking in strathbogie granite up to 200 ◦c, and heating of the granite to a greater temperature as 400 ◦c caused many intra-granular cracks in quartz and feldspar and some grain boundary cracks between quartz and feldspar minerals. furthermore, according to ae analysis, increasing the temperature first causes the crack propagation stress threshold to increase and further increasing of the temperature causes it to be slightly reduced. this indicates a suppression of micro-cracks at low temperatures by matrix expansion and the development of micro-cracks through thermally-induced damage at higher temperatures. finally an attempt was made to improve the conventional mohrcoulomb failure criteria for geothermal reservoirs with extreme pressures and temperatures, because the conventional criteria are not applicable to extreme conditions. acknowledgements this research project is funded by the australian research council (arc dp160104223) and the authors would like to

reservoirs. the present study may therefore capture more realistic geothermal reservoir behaviour. 3.6. temperature-dependent failure criteria for strathbogie granite ≤ (3) − is questionable, due to the to date, although many strength criteria are available for intact rock, the practical application of most of them for geothermal reservoirs in-situ model parameters required when considering the available high-pressure and high-temperature environment in underground reservoirs. of the various failure criteria, the mohr-coulomb failure criteria have been extensively used in the field and have made a significant contribution to the determination of rock mass failure. however, they have some major limitations, including ignoring the intermediate stress (cid:2)2 inﬂuence (which has been proven to have a substantial inﬂuence on rock strength) and the assumed linearity (the strength criteria of rock are non-linear in reality). after re-analyzing thousands of reported triaxial experiments and combining the critical state concept proposed by barton (1976),  (2011) proposed a non-linear mohr-coulomb failure criterion. according to the findings of  (2011), the mohr-coulomb shear strength parameters should only be obtained by performing conventional tri-axial tests under low confining stresses (in the linear region of the mohr-coulomb failure envelope). according to their statistical analysis, (cid:2)cc ≈ (cid:2)crit, where (cid:2)c and (cid:2) crit are uni-axial compressive strength and critical confining pressure, respectively. the modified mohr-coulomb failure criterion proposed by  is given below: (cid:2)1 − (cid:2)3 = where, (cid:2)ci ≈ (cid:2)ci + 2sin(cid:3)i0 sin(cid:3)i0 ucs of the rock = 2ciocos(cid:3)i0/1 sin(cid:3)i0, (cid:3)i0 and cio are friction

failure criteria cannot be directly applied to geothermal reservoir rocks at extreme pressures and temperatures, because the strength response is altered by the thermal effect (heuze, 1983). to date, no extensive study has captured this thermal response in the improved mohrcoulomb failure criteria. such a realistic approach is necessary for deep underground engineering applications like geothermal energy extraction. the concepts of barton (1976) and  (2011) are therefore incorporated into the temperature inﬂuence in this study and an attempt is made to propose novel strength criteria for geothermal reservoir rocks based on experimental data: + 2sin(cid:3)i (t) sin(cid:3)i (t) (cid:2)3 − − 1 − (cid:2)3 (t) = 2ci (t) cos(cid:3)i (t) sin(cid:3)i (t) 1 (cid:2)1 − (4) (cid:2)3 ≤
