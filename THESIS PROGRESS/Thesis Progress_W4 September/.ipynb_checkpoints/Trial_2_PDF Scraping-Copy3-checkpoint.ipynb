       "'THE\\n\\nAMERICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE\\n[FIFTH SERIES.]\\n\\n———_#oe\\n\\nArt, VI.—The Thermal Conductivity and Compressi-\\nbility of several Rocks under High Pressures; by\\nP. W. Brineman.\\n\\nINTRODUCTION.\\n\\nThe effect of pressure on the thermal conductivity of\\nrocks has apparently never been determined, although a\\nknowledge of it is important in calculating the thermal\\nequilibrium of the earth’s crust. The only measure-\\nments we have that can give any idea of the possible\\ninfluence of hydrostatic pressure are on the effect of one-\\nsided compression on the thermal conductivity of granite\\nand marble.t It1is of course well known that a one-sided\\ncompression need not be at all like a hydrostatic pres-\\nsure in its effects, and the only conclusion that we can\\ndraw from the experiments of Lees as applied to condi-\\ntions within the crust of the earth is that the effect of\\npressure is probably not very large. .\\n\\nIn connection with my work on the effect of high pres-\\nsures on general physical properties of various sub-\\nstances, I have recently been engaged in measuring the\\nthermal conductivity of-a number of liquids up to 12000\\nke/em?. Since the apparatus could be adapted without\\nmuch trouble to measure the effect of pressure on the\\nthermal conductivity of those solids whose conductivity\\nis not too high, such as the rocks, I thought it of interest\\nto make a few measurements from which at least the\\ngeneral trend of the effects to be expected could be\\ninferred. I have been encouraged in this attempt by\\nthe interest and advice of Professor R. A. Daly, who also\\nwas so kind as to obtain several of the materials for me.\\nI also have to thank my assistant, Mr. H. B. Curry, for\\nmaking many of the readings.\\n\\n1For references see the end of this article.\\n\\nAm. Jour. Scr.— Firtx Sreriss, Vou. VII, No. 388.—Frpsrvuary, 1924.\\n6\\n 82 P., W. Bridgman—Thermal Conductivity and\\n\\nIn addition to the thermal conductivity I have deter-\\nmined the compressibility of the materials used. It was\\ncomparatively easy to do this as the apparatus had\\nalready been developed for another purpose. When I\\nbegan these measurements the important paper of Adams\\nand Williamson? on the compressibility of rocks had not\\nappeared, and such questions as that of the change with\\npressure of the compressibility of a rock had not received\\nan answer. Since the appearance of that paper, my\\ncompressibility results lose some of their novel interest,\\nbut there are still a number of points in connection with\\nthem which I think may suggest new lines of thought.\\nIn the first place, I have measured the compressibility\\nof several of my materials at two temperatures, neither\\nvery high it is true, 30° and 75°, but nevertheless suffi-\\nciently far apart to give an idea of the variation of\\ncompressibility with temperature. This of course is\\nimportant when applying results obtained in the labora-\\ntory at room temperatures to actual conditions. The\\nnecessary information can not be obtained from the\\nresults of Adams and Williamson because their compres-\\nsibilities were measured at only one temperature. In\\nthe second place, my method, which measures the linear\\nas opposed to the cubical compressibility, brings out the\\nimportance of non-isotropy, as the measurements of\\nAdams and Williamson on cubical compressibility can-\\nnot do. I have found surprisingly large differences of\\ncompressibility in different directions, and also entirelv\\nunexpected and abnormal hysteresis relations. Both\\nthese factors are of importance in calculating the velocity\\nof propagation of earthquake waves or other deforma-\\ntional effects in the earth’s crust.\\n\\nThermal Conductivity.\\n\\nThe Method.—The method used for measuring thermal\\nconductivity is essentially the same as that used for\\nliquids, and is deseribed in detail elsewhere;? a brief\\nsummary here will suffice. The material whose conduc-\\ntivity is to be measured is worked to the form of a cylin-\\ndrical shell, which is slipped between an outer and an\\ninner cylinder of copper, each of which it fits accurately.\\nAn insulated wire stretched along the axis of the inner\\ncopper evlinder carries an electric current, so that the\\n Compressibility of Rocks under Pressure. 91\\n\\nentertain the possibility of the conductivity being several\\nfold greater than the accepted value.\\n\\nPyrex glass does not depart from the average crys-\\ntalline rock in the effect of pressure on conductivity,\\nalthough the absolute conductivity is lower, as is usually\\nthe case for a glass.\\n\\nCompressibility.\\n\\nThe normal behavior of compressibility is as follows.\\nWhen a homogeneous isotropic solid is subjected to\\nhydrostatic pressure it experiences a uniform change of\\ndimensions in all directions, so that the geometrical\\nshape of any part of the solid is unaltered; this change\\nof dimensions is a function of the pressure and tempera-\\nture only and does not depend in any way on the past\\npressure history of the specimen. In other words, there\\nare no hysteresis, elastic-after-effects, or allied phenom-\\nena, but the strain is a single valued function of the\\npressure. The percentage change of volume for a given\\nincrement of pressure in all cases hitherto examined\\nbecomes less at the higher pressures (that is, the com-\\npressibility decreases at high pressures), and in nearly\\nall cases, although not universally, the compressibility\\nis greater at higher temperatures.\\n\\nFor the materials of this paper, this simple type of\\nbehavior is not always followed, but there are significant\\ndepartures. To exhibit these, it will be best to describe\\nthe results in detail.\\n\\nPipestone.—The first sample of this which I measured\\nbehaved in a way which was in one respect the most sig-\\nnificant and striking of any of this series. The experi-\\nmetal results are plotted in fig. 3, which shows the\\nobserved fractional changes of length against the corre-\\nsponding pressures. In the first place the change of\\nleneth is not a single valued function of the pressure but\\nthere is a very marked loop, in shape like the well known\\nhysteresis loops of magnetism or the stress-strain loops\\nof a substance stressed beyond the elastic limit. The\\ngreatest width of this loop was 18.2% of the maximum\\nchange of length. This loop is not a temporary phenom-\\nenon obtained only on the first application of pressure,\\nsuch as I have sometimes found, and which may be\\nexplained by flaws or crevices which are squeezed tight\\n 92 P. W. Bridgman—Thermal Conductivity and\\n\\nby a high pressure, but it is a legitimate and permanent\\neffect, which may be repeated, as this specimen had been\\nsubjected to a previous pressure seasoning. The two-\\npoints in fig. 3 which appear to be off the curve, at 1000\\n\\nand 10000 kg., were obtained by a slightly different pro-\\ncedure than the others, the 1000 point after a release of\\n\\nFie. 3.\\n\\nerrprepryport :\\none BESET ALE oa\\nsee cen he ETT |\\neecuaetel tadpi AP.\\n\\nTH fas\\nseated\\n\\n, iam\\nt rh E\\n\\n{ ET\\nac ene\\nSphere\\n\\nTt\\nttt\\n\\nomen ie .

Experi-\\nence with other lag effects would lead one to expect these\\npoints to lie off the curve in exactly the way found, and\\nthe fact that they were so found is confirmation of the\\nlegitimateness of the effect.\\n Compressibility of Rocks wnder Pressure. 93\\n\\nApart from the existence of the loop, the second sur-\\nprising feature is the direction in which it is described.\\n‘‘Hysteresis’’? means a lagging behind, and this suggests\\nin general the physical reason for the effect. Normal\\nhysteresis would demand that when pressure is released,\\ncoming from a higher value, for example, the change of\\nvolume does not assume the value appropriate to that\\npressure, but lags behind, assuming a value to be found\\nat some higher pressure on the ascending branch of\\ncurve. The physical reason is usually sought in internal\\nfriction or in some inherent small-scale instability except\\nwhen in one of two extreme configurations, as is best\\nuUlustrated in Ewing’s theory of ferro-magnetism.\\n\\nThe phenomena found here are the exact reverse of\\nnormal. On the descending branch of the curve the\\nchange of volume is that to be found at a lower instead of\\nat a higher pressure on the ascending branch. In other\\nwords, instead of this being a lag phenomenon, it 1s a\\nphenomenon of advance, and the loop is a reverse loop.\\nI have sometimes found effects like this, but only in com-\\nplicated systems in which the explanation can be found\\nin the interaction of a number of unlike phenomena, and\\nnever in such a marked degree as here. It is probable,\\nJ think, that there must be a complicated state of internal\\nstrains to account for such a state of affairs. An arti-\\nficial mechanism may be imagined, which may have some\\nrelation to the actual mechanism, which will give effects\\nof this kind. Suppose the solid contains a number of\\nlenticular cavities provided with a valve mechanism such\\nthat liquid can get from the outside into the interior only\\nwhen the pressure outside is in excess of that inside by a\\ndefinite amount, and similarly liquid can pass from the\\ninside out only when the pressure inside rises a definite\\namount above that outside. When fluid pressure\\nis applied to such a cavity, the first effect is to\\nsqueeze it flat, but when pressure rises high enough,\\nliquid penetrates to the inside and the cavity swells,\\ntending to resume its natural lenticular shape. When\\nthe external pressure 1s now removed, the eavity first\\nswells because of the volume expansion of the liquid\\ninside, but when pressure outside has decreased to a\\ncertain value, liquid comes out from the interior and the\\ncavity shrinks. That is, such a mechanism has an abnor-\\n 94 P. W. Bridgman—Thermal Conductivity and\\n\\nmally large compressibility during the initial stage and\\nan abnormally small compressibility during the final\\nstage of a pressure increase, with the reversed behavior\\nduring decrease, which is exactly the behavior of the\\nrever sed loop found above.\\n\\nThe importance of this effect in speculation is evident,\\nfor it is a consequence of it that the initial elastic con-\\nstants for small stress differences of a substance like\\npipestone may vary by a factor of more than two-fold,\\ndepending on the past stress history of the material.\\nFurthermore, the mean elastic constant will vary greatly\\nwith the magnitude of the deforming stress or the defor-\\nmation, so that it may be quite differ ent for the strains\\nwhich we have in tidal deformation and those found in\\nmountain building, for example.\\n\\nThe effect is so important that it seemed worth while\\nto verify it on other samples. Accordingly another\\nspecimen was tried in another apparatus, in order to\\neliminate any possibility of instrumental error. This\\nsecond specimen was measured at 30° and 75°. The\\neffect was again found, but much less in amount, the\\nwidth of the reverse loop being at 30° only 3.1% of the\\nmaximum effect, and at 75° 2.3%. The sample used with\\nthe second apparatus was a short rod about 2.5 cm. long,\\nwhereas that used with the first was 15 ecm. long. To\\nfurther make certain freedom from instrumental error,\\na piece 2.5 em. long was now cut from the first sample\\nand measured in the second apparatus at 30°. This\\nendeavor to ensure freedom from instrumental error was\\nreally quite superfluous because the identical apparatus\\nhad been used in measuring the compressibility of\\nmetals,’ whose changes of dimensions are much smaller,\\nwith no hysteresis or similar effects of as much as 0.1%.\\nThe effect was again found; the loop was again reverse,\\nand the width was 11.4% of the maximum. The shape\\nof the loop was not as regular as that found before, but\\nwas as indicated in fig. 4.\\n\\nIt is evident that the pipestone is not at all a homo-\\ngeneous material but that different parts differ greatly\\nin hysteresis effects, and presumably in internal strain.\\nAlong with differences in hysteresis goes a difference in\\nthe absolute compressibility ; the compressibility was\\nconsiderably less for the piece that showed large reverse\\nhysteresis. The following results were found:\\n Compressibility of Rocks under Pressure. 95\\n\\nFor the long rod with 18% reverse hysteresis the aver-\\nage linear compressibility between 0 and 12000 kg/cm?\\nwas at the rate of 4.34 X 107 per kg. For the short piece cut\\nfrom one end of the long rod the average change of length\\nbetween 0 and 12000 was at the rate of 3.87 X 10%. The\\nreverse loop of the other specimen was so narrow that it\\n\\nFia. 4.\\n\\nFic. 4.—The compressibility cycle of another sample of pipestone, change\\nof length against pressure. Again the direction of the loop is abnormal.\\n\\nwas possible to draw an average line half way between\\nthe ascending and descending branches of the curve.\\nThe change of length as a function of, pressure on this\\naverage line is given by the formulas:\\n\\nAZ\\nT = 6.50 x 10~\" 9 — 6.81 x 10-”* p? at 30°,\\n\\nGQ\\n\\nAl :\\nT= 6.89 KX 107 p — 5.81 X 107\" p’ at 75°.\\n\\nThe average linear compressibility of the specimen with\\nhttle reverse hysteresis is thus 50% greater than that of\\nthe other. Itis not to be expected that the compressibil-\\nity of material of this kind is the same in every direction,\\nand therefore the volume compressibility cannot be com-\\nputed from the linear compressibility in a_ single\\ndirection.\\n\\nIt is to be emphasized that the abnormal behavior of\\n 96 P. W. Bridgman—Thermal Conductivity and\\n\\npipestone may be expected to represent a lower rather\\nthan an upper limit to the abnormalities of the materials\\nof the earth’s crust in situ. For this piece of pipestone,\\nmeasured in a laboratory, was a small piece whose\\nexternal surfaces were free from stress, and in which\\nany internal strains must have been fairly small, because\\ndue to the differential strains in a small mass. The\\nrocks in the crust, however, are subjected to shearing\\nstresses up to the limit of their strength, and the stresses\\nvary greatly from place to place, so that the internal\\nstrains, and therefore probably elastic abnormalities,\\nmust be high.\\n\\nSolenhofen Iimestone.—This material was in the form\\nof a rod 10 em. long and roughly 6 mm. in diameter, cut\\nwith the diamond saw from the same piece as the thermal\\nconductivity cylinder. Its compressibility was measured\\nat 30° and 75°. At both these temperatures the same\\nreverse hysteresis was found as for pipestone, but much\\nless in amount. At 30° the width of the loop was 6.4%\\nof the maximum effect, and at 75° 2.4%. The effect\\ndecreases with rising temperature, as it did also for pipe-\\nstone, but by a much larger factor. A decrease with\\nrising temperature is what would be expected if it is an\\nInternal strain effect.\\n\\nAt 30° the average volume compressibility between 0\\nand 12000 kg/cm? is 0.0,1838 per kg., and at 75° 0.0,1392,\\nassuming equal compressibility in all directions. If the\\nmean compressihjlity is taken from a curve drawn half-\\nway between the ascending and descending branches of\\nthe hysteresis loop, then it will be found that the mean\\ncompressibility decreases with rising pressure, as is nor-\\nmal. The departure from linearity, which is about the\\nsame at both temperatures, is such that at 6000 kg. the\\nactual change of volume is about 4% greater than would\\nbe calculated by using the average compressibility\\nbetween 0 and 12000.\\n. Adams, Williamson, and Johnston’ found for the mean\\ncompressibility of CaCO, between 2000 and 10000 kg.\\n13.6 X 107, and found no variation with pressure. Their\\naverage figure agrees surprisingly well with the mean\\nvalue found above for limestone. :\\n\\nBasalt.—The sample used was about 2.5 em. long, and\\nwas the core of the thermal conductivity cylinder. It\\n Compressibility of Rocks under Pressure. 97\\n\\nwas measured at 30° and 75°. Again reverse hysteresis\\nwas found, but this time the greatest width of the loop\\nwas only 1.5% of the maximum effect. Within the limits\\nof error (not over 0.07%) the compressibility was the\\nsame at the two temperatures. If the mean of the\\nascending and descending branches of the loop is taken,\\nand the compressibility is assumed equal in all directions,\\nthen the relation between pressure and change of volume\\nis given by the formula: |\\n\\n.~ = 15.60 X 107’ p — 13.4 K 107\" pp’.\\n\\nAdams and Williamson? found for two diabases of\\ndensities 3.002 and 2.975, 12.4 *107 and 14.1 x 107\\nrespectively for the average compressibility between\\n2000 and 10000, with no perceptible variation with pres-\\nsure. My basalt, which is diabasic in character, was not\\nas dense; the agreement is as good as to be expected.\\n\\nTalc—Measurements were made on four samples.\\nThe first sample was a rod 10 em. long, not from the\\nidentical piece as the thermal conductivity sample, but\\nfrom the same lot. It was without evident schistosity\\nor other structure. It was measured at 30° and 75°.\\nThe smoothed results at these two temperatures were\\nsensibly the same, although at 75° there were perfectly\\nconsistent small departures from the usual course con-\\nsisting of a somewhat accelerated volume change at low\\npressures followed by a retardation, such that the total\\nvolume change at 12000 was the same as at 30°. There\\nwas no reverse hysteresis in perceptible amount. The rela-\\ntion between volume change and pressure for this\\nsample, assuming equal compressibility in all directions,\\nis given by the formula:\\n\\nAV\\nV\\n\\n— 10.4 X 10 \"p— 6.38 X 107\" p’.\\n\\n0\\n\\nThis compressibility is so much less than I expected\\nfrom the general softness of the substance, that the\\nquestion arose whether it was really equally compressible\\nin all directions. Professor Palache informed me that a\\nstructure would be expected from the manner of. depost-\\n\\nAm. Jour. Scr.—Firts Sreriss, Vou. VII, No. 38.—FrEsruary, 1924.\\n 98 iP. W.

He was so kind\\nas to select for me a sample from the same lot‘as the other\\nsamples which did show schistosity, the material evi-\\ndently having been laid down on a series of planes.\\nFrom this block three short rods were cut in directions\\nmutually at right angles, and the compressibility of each\\nof these rods was measured at 30°.\\n\\nThe results obtained for these three samples were all\\nperfectly regular, and without hysteresis, direct or\\nreverse. The relation between change of length and\\npressure could in each case be represented by an expres-\\nsion of the second degree in the pressure. The following\\nvalues were found:\\n\\nSample # I\\n\\nA\\nae 8.76 X 107\" p — 16.6 & 107\" p?\\n\\nSample # IT\\n\\nA\\nT= 5.69 X 107\" p — 5.49 K 107\" p”\\n\\nSample # ITI\\n\\nA ;\\nAl _ 3.84 x L077 p — 4.93 X-107\"? p?,\\n\\n0\\n\\nSamples I and III were cut parallel to the plane of\\nschistosity, while II was perpendicular to it. The results\\nshow in the first place a variation with direction of 2.3\\nfold, which is greater than I had expected in material of\\nthis character. In the second place, there is no immedi-\\nate connection evident with the plane of schistosity, the\\nlinear compressibility of II being intermediate between\\nthe other two.\\n\\nThe average initial volume compressibility, obtained\\nby adding the three initial linear compressibilities, 1s\\n18.3 x 107. The sample first measured was evidently\\n Compressibility of Rocks under Pressure. 99\\n\\ncut by accident along a direction of very low compressi-\\nbility. © ,\\n\\nIt is evident enough that a distortional wave through\\nmaterial of this character will not be propagated as\\nthrough a homogeneous isotropic substance.\\n\\nThe great variation found in the linear compressibility\\nof pipestone and tale probably has an important bearing\\non a suggestion in the recent paper of L. H. Adams and\\nWilliamson.!® These authors measured the cubic com-\\npressibility of rocks between 2000 and 12000 kg. by a\\ndirect method, but did not carry their results below\\n2000. EF. D. Adams and E. G. Coker,\" on the other hand,\\nhad measured the compressibility at low stresses by an\\nindirect method which involved the assumption of the\\nhomogeneity and isotropy of the material. They found\\ncompressibilities which in some cases were twice as high\\nas those found by L. H. Adams and Williamson. Adams\\nand Williamson reconcile the two sets of results by sup-\\nposing below 2000 kg. a very rapid increase of compressi-\\nbility, which is perhaps connected in some way with a\\nlooseness of structure of the rocks which disappears at\\nhigh pressures. Of course it is possible that this may\\nbe the correct explanation, and in any event the ultimate\\nanswer can only be obtained by a direct measurement of\\nthe comvressibility at low pressures, but in view of my\\nresults above it seems to me that a much more likely\\nexplanation is that the values of F. D.

It was from\\nthe same length of tubing as the thermal conductivity\\nsample, and was made from it by working in the fire into\\na solid rod and drawing down. It was not perfectly\\nhomogeneous, but there were a few minute bubbles in it.\\n\\nThe compressibility was measured at 30° and 75°.\\nThe results were very regular and self-consistent. The\\nmaximum. departure of any point from a smooth curve\\nwas 0.36% of the maximum effect. There was no\\nhysteresis of any kind. Within the limits of error there\\nwas no difference between the compressibility at the two\\ntemperatures. Assuming equal compressibility in all\\n 100) PP. W. Bridgman—Thermal Conductivity and\\n\\ndirections, the relation between pressure and change of\\nvolume is given by the formula:\\n\\nAV\\nv\\n\\n0\\n\\n= 80.27 & LO p+ 9.9 x 107? p?,\\n\\nThis glass shows the abnormal feature, the first time\\nthat I have found it, of a compressibility which increases\\nat high pressures. The effect is comparatively large,\\nand much beyond the possibility of any experimental\\nerror, As I have already said elsewhere in discussing\\nthe possibility of such an effect,!? there seems to be no\\nfundamental reason why the effect should not -exist, but\\nit certainly is not what we expect. One might be inclined\\nto search for a connection between the effect and the\\nminute bubbles in the glass, but the effect of bubbles\\nwould be expected to be in the opposite direction, giving\\ntoo high a compressibility at low pressures before the\\nbubbles close up, and furthermore if the bubbles are\\nnumerous enough to have a perceptible effect on com-\\npressibility, one would look for hysteresis arising from\\nnon-hydrostatie internal strains in the neighborhood of\\nthe bubbles.*\\n\\nEvidence confirming the reality of this effect may be\\ndrawn from the work of Adams, Williamson,’? and\\nJohnston on compressibility. They found for all their\\nmaterials whose compressibility was as high as this a\\ndecrease of compressibility with rising pressure with the\\nexception of silica glass, which was constant between\\n2000 and 8000 kg.,in spite of the comparatively high\\nvalue of its compressibility, 3.1 x 10*. Now the experi-\\nments of Adams, Williamson and Johnston are not as\\nsensitive as these to changes of compressibility with\\npressure, and it may well be that if they did not find the\\neffect it is really negative. At any rate it is abnormally\\nsmall.\\n\\nThe compressibility of the pyrex found above,\\n3.03 & 10°, is unusually high for a glass which for ordi-\\nnary compositions is in the neighborhood of 2.3. The\\n\\n* Note added on reading proof. The abnormal change of compressibility\\nwith pressure has now been verified on a sample of pyrex glass free from\\nflaws and thoroughly annealed, prepared for me by the Corning Glass Works\\nfor this express purpose.\\n Compressibility of Rocks under Pressure. 83\\n\\naxis is a source of heat. This heat flows out radially\\nthrough the inner copper cylinder, through the shell of\\nrock, through the outer copper cylinder, and into the\\nsurrounding temperature bath through the walls of the\\npressure eylinder into which the outer copper cylinder\\nclosely fits. The difference of temperature between the\\ninner and outer copper cylinders is measured with\\nthermo-couples. From a- knowledge of the heat input,\\nthe temperature difference and the geometrical config-\\nuration, the thermal conductivity may be computed.\\n\\nThe interior of the pressure cylinder, in which the\\nthermal conductivity apparatus is contained, is entirely\\nfilled with an electrically insulating liquid (petroleum\\nether for 30° and kerosene for 75°) in which the conduc-\\ntivity cylinders are completely bathed. Pressure may be\\napplied to this liquid by means of the intensifier which I\\nhave often described.t| The pressure is transmitted by\\nthe liquid equally to all parts of the conductivity appa-\\nratus. The thermal conductivity may now be determined\\nas a function of the pressure in the liquid.\\n\\nThe most important correction to be applied to the\\nreadings directly obtained is that due to the lack\\nof perfect fit between the cylinder of rock and the inner.\\nand outer copper cylinders. It was of course not possi-\\nble to make the fit perfect, so that in addition to the rock\\nin which we are interested there was always a film of\\nliquid between the two copper cylinders. What was\\nactually measured was the resultant conductivity of\\nlayers of rock and liquid in series. Since the thermal\\nconductivity of the liquid is much less than that of the\\nrock, it is necessary to know the geometrical dimensions\\naccurately. The cylinders were formed by machining\\nor grinding, and were of a gratifying geometrical reg-\\nularity. The outside diameter was uniform within a few\\nten-thousandths of an inch, as was also the length. The\\noutside measurements could be made with sufficient\\naccuracy with ordinary micrometers, and mean dimen-\\nsions obtained from a large number of readings. The\\ninside diameter could not be measured directly. This\\nwas obtained from the total weight of the specimen, its\\ndensity (which was determined by weighing in water in\\nthe regular way), and the outside dimensions. The cop-\\nper cylinders could be measured directly with sufficient\\n Compressibility of Rocks under Pressure. 101\\n\\nvalue for pyrex is close to the value of Adams, William-\\nson, and Johnston for silica glass, suggesting a similarity\\nof effect.\\n\\nThis increase of compressibility at high pressures\\ndeserves to be more extensively investigated with other\\nmaterials.\\n\\nSummary.\\n\\nThermal Conductivity—The thermal conductivity of\\npipestone, tale, Solenhofen limestone, basalt, pyrex glass\\nand rock salt has been measured up to 12000 kg/cm? at\\n30° and in most cases at 75° also. The conductivity\\nincreases with rising pressure by an amount which may\\nvary from 0.1% per 1000 kg. at 30° for Solenhofen lime-\\nstone to 3.6% for rock salt. Probably for the ordinary\\nrock of the earth’s crust the effect is not over 0.5% at\\nordinary temperatures. The absolute conductivity and\\nits pressure coefficient may either increase or decrease\\nwith rising temperature.\\n\\nCompressibility—A simple hydrostatic pressure\\napplied to substances of the character of those measured\\nhere does not in general produce a uniform change of\\nvolume, but the effects are complicated. The relation\\nbetween pressure and deformation may be affected by\\nhvsteresis in a direction the reverse of normal; I have\\nfound this in pipestone, Solenhofen- limestone, and\\nbasalt in amounts varying from a few per cent to 18 per\\ncent of the whole deformation. Tale and pipestone show\\nlarge differences of linear compressibility in different\\ndirections; this effect was not investigated for the other\\nmaterials. Pyrex glass has an abnormal increase of\\ncompressibility at high pressures.\\n\\nGeological Consequences.—As far as the results on\\nthermal conductivity go, only rough conclusions can be\\ndrawn, but it would seem that in view of the possible\\nvariations found with pressure and temperature one\\nshould be prepared in geological speculations to con-\\nsider that thermal conductivity at a depth of several\\nhundred miles may be several fold greater than the value\\nnow accepted.\\n\\nThat the compressibility is different in different direc-\\ntions suggests that deep in the earth’s crust where there\\nare large differential stresses, with the probability of\\n 102.

There is, however, a geometrical\\ncorrection due to the change with pressure of the length\\nof the axis of the cylinder, but this correction is so small\\nthat it was neglected in the present work.\\n\\nThe formula gives at once the means of calculating the\\nconductivity of the rock if that of the surrounding liquid\\nis known. This was determined as a function of pressure\\nby the experiments on liquids, and the numerical values\\nmay be found in the paper describing those experiments.\\nThe correction for the liquid was of the order of one-\\nthird or one-quarter of the total effect at atmospheric\\npressure. Under the maximum pressure the conductiv-\\nity of the liquid increases by a factor of 2.7, so that the\\ncorrection is correspondingly reduced at the high pres-\\nsures. ‘T\\'he results are, therefore, better at the high than\\nat the low pressures.\\n\\nChoice of Materials ——The chief restriction on the\\nchoice of materials was the necessity of being able to\\nwork them into accurate cylindrical shells.

The other materials\\n\\n_@7i\\n6,—8.= | log\\n 86 =P. W. Bridgman—Thermal Conductivity and\\n\\nI chose after conference with Professor Daly, the object\\nbeing to obtain a few materials which could be worked\\nwith some degree of ease, and which at the same time.\\nin conjunction with the tale and pipestone already\\nselected, should fairly represent the range of material\\nto be encountered in the earth’s crust. It was at his sug-\\ngestion that Solenhofen limestone and a diabasic basalt\\nwere selected. Both of these were too hard to machine,\\nand had to be worked to shape by grinding. I am\\nindebted to Mr. David Mann for devising a method of\\ndoing this, and to my mechanic Mr. T. R. Richardson for\\nskillfully preparing the specimens. In addition to these,\\npyrex glass was also measured at the suggestion of Pro-\\nfessor Daly, who recognized the importance of an\\nexample of a glassy non-crystalline material. This was\\nnot prepared by grinding, but was cut into the proper\\nlength from a piece of commercial tubing of such size as\\nto fit closely the copper cylinders both inside and outside.\\nThis specimen was selected personally by Professor Daly\\nafter detailed examination of an extensive commercial\\nstock. HEven with this care, the glass was not as perfect\\ngeometrically as the ground specimens, but showed\\neccentricities of 1.5%. Mean dimensions of the glass\\nwere used in the ealenlations.\\n\\nIn addition to the rocks I have measured the thermal\\neonduetivity of rock salt under pressure, chiefly for its\\nphysical interest, as we are now becoming able to explain\\na good many of the physical properties of simple\\nerystals, and of rock salt in particular, in terms of the\\nfine structure, and the thermal conductivity of no simple\\nerystal has been measured under pressure.\\n\\nAnalysis of the Materials.—The pipestone was obtained\\nfrom the Ward Natural History Establishment at\\nRochester, N. Y., and is the material described by Dana\\nas ‘‘eatlinite.’’ It is an iron-rich clay stone; a typical\\nanalysis gives: SiO, 57.4, Al.O, 25.9, Fe.O, 8.7, H.O 7.4,\\nMgO and CaO trace. It is without ovitty inclusions of\\nany kind, and may be turned in the lathe without damage\\nto the keen edge of a steel tool. The material was not per-\\nfectly homogeneous in appearance, but the color varied\\nfrom a deep red to a much paler and yellowish hue. The\\nthermal conductivity sample was a deep red throughout.\\nIts density at 20° was 2.840 (corrected for vacunm, as\\nare all the densities given in the following).\\n land\\n\\nCompressibility of Rocks under Pressure. 8\\n\\nThe tale was from the Hewitt mine, Hewitt, N. C. and\\nwas very soft without any gritty inclusions. The analy-\\nsis is given as follows in Heconomic Paper No. 3, 1900, of\\nthe N. C. Geological Survey: Water 5.10; Silica (Si0,)\\n61.35; Al,O, 4.42; FeO 1.68; CaO 0.82; MgO 26.03;\\nNa,.O 0.62; and K,O trace.\\n\\nThe material is not perfectly homogeneous, but there\\nis a certain amount of schistosity evident, the material\\nhaving apparently been laid down im layers. The den-\\nsity at 20° 1s 2.701. ,\\n\\nThe Solenhofen limestone is very nearly pure CaCO...\\nIt is of a light brownish color, and was deposited in\\nlayers from one-half to three-quarters of an inch thick.\\nThe thermal conductivity and the compressibility samples\\nwere cut from the same layer. The density at 20° is\\n2.602.\\n\\nThe diabasic basalt is described as follows by Profes-\\nsor K. S. Larsen of the University Museum; I am much\\nindebted to him for procuring the analysis.\\n\\n‘“‘The sample is made up in large part of labradorite laths\\nand augite grains, the latter moulding about and between the\\nformer. There is about 10% of interstitial brown matrix that\\nwas originally mostly glass but is now partly devitrified and car-\\nries microlites of augite and is clouded with magnetite grains.\\nOlivine in grains now altered to a serpentine-like mineral makes\\nup nearly 10% of the rock. The feldspars are partly altered\\nto a mineral that resembles sericite.\\n\\nThe plagioclase laths average about 0.1 mm. in length, the\\nolivine grains about 0.1 mm. in diameter and the augite grains\\na little larger. The serpentine and sericite are hydrous minerals\\nand might lose some of their water even below 100° C.’’\\n\\nThe density at room temperature was 2.924.\\n\\nThe pyrex glass was approximately: S10, 81.35, B.O,\\n11.50, Na,O 4.00; Al,O, 2.1, CaO 0.2, MgO 0.28. The\\ndensity at room temperature was 2.234.\\n\\nThe rock salt was a natural crystal, perfectly clear and\\nflawless. It was machined to shape in the lathe with\\ncutting tools, and I owe it to the skill of Mr. David Mann.\\n\\nResults—The regularity of the readings was not as\\ngreat as that possible to obtain with the liquids. The\\nreason is that the apparatus is best adapted to materials\\nwith low conductivity, and the conductivity of liquids is\\nlower than that of those solids measured here. Never-\\ntheless a degree of accuracy was obtained amply sufficient\\nfor the purpose in hand, and doubtless the accuracy of\\n 88 P. W.
