       " '(McGuinness et al.1995). Generally, faults acting aspreferential ﬂuid path ways signiﬁcantly change the pres-sure and temperature ﬁeld in the reservoir (Cherubini et al.2013). Models for the Seferihisar–Balc¸ova ﬁeld focus onthe ﬂuid ﬂow inside of faults. Results show an enhancedupward heat transport through ﬂuids from bottom of thegeothermal system (Magri et al.2011).Our test ground is the Lahendong geothermal ﬁeldlocated in Sulawesi, Indonesia. The ﬁeld is owned andoperated by P.T. Pertamina Geothermal Energy and hosts apower plant with a production capacity of 80 MWe. There,geothermal exploration started in the early 1970s includinggeophysical and geohydrochemical approaches. It is awater-dominated magmatic structurally controlled system.Faults generally act as across-fault ﬂuid barriers and along-fault ﬂuid conductors (Brehme et al.2014). As a result, hotsprings mainly appear on the top of vertically permeablefaults at the surface. Available numerous drilling and sur-face measurements allowed a detailed characterization ofthe geological and hydrogeological setting of the area(Fig.1; Brehme et al.2011,2013,2014,2016; Wiegandet al.2013). The model presented here is developed forinvestigating subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow and the permeabilitydistribution including the fault zones in the Lahendonggeothermal ﬁeld. Below, the geological structure of theﬁeld is presented followed by an introduction to the mod-eling approach.Detailed investigation of subsurface permeability dis-tribution is a crucial step for site selection and smart dril-ling strategies. The numerical simulations presented willprovide insight into understanding the subsurface ﬂuid ﬂowconsidering the hydraulic conductivity of faults. It ensuresproductive as well as sustainable operation of geothermalﬁelds avoiding risks, such as drilling into non-fractured orcold zones, and targeting highly corroding waters.Although the target area is Lahendong, the general work-ﬂow is applicable for other geothermal sites consisting ofsimilar constraints.\\nReservoir characterization\\nHydrogeologyThe overall driving force for the ﬂuid ﬂow is the SW–NEoriented natural hydraulic gradient in the Lahendonggeothermal system. The direction of ﬂuid ﬂow variesthrough the geothermal site due to horizontal partitioningof the reservoir by relatively less permeable fault zones(Brehme et al.2014). The basic sections are located in the\\n\\n\\nFig. 1Topographic map of the study area with geological features, water and rock sample locations, and model cross section\\n1088Page 2 of 11Environ Earth Sci (2016) 75:1088\\n123',\n",

Also, types of ﬂuid change from onesection to another, e.g., an acidic highly saline-typebeneath Lake Linau and a neutral low saline-type south andeast of Lake Linau (Fig.1). The impermeable structureacross faults prevent the ﬂuids from diluting each other(Brehme et al.2016). However, faults are rather permeablealong the vertical axis, which allows recharge of the systemthrough the faults. Rainwater inﬁltrates at a fault in the SW,at Mt. Lengkoan, and creek water inﬁltrates into the normalfaults at Lake Linau (Fig.2). The hydrothermal systemdischarges into Lake Linau and toward the NE, as drivenby the hydraulic gradient (Brehme et al.2014).The fracture network along the area is characterized bystrike slip faults and normal faults. The sinistral faultsstrike N 40/C176and steeply dip toward the SE. Left step overon the strike slip faults forms an extension basin in thecentral study area. Normal faults at the extension basinstrike NW and dip 70/C176–80/C176beneath Lake Linau (Brehmeet al.2014).LithologyLahendong area is mainly characterized by Pre-, Post- andTondano formation of Plio- to Pleistocene age (Koestonoet al.2010). The rocks are typically andesite, volcanicbreccia, and tuff. Those types have been sampled fromborehole cores and used to determine porosity, permeabil-ity, and thermal conductivity. Effective porosity and matrixpermeability have been analyzed using a cylindrical-shapedspecimen with a dimension of 5 cm x 5 cm92.5 cm ori-ented parallel to the coring (Brehme et al.2016). Thermalconductivity has been measured on plain sections of driedcores. The experimental setup consists of a gas perme-ameter for determining matrix permeability (Milsch et al.2011), of an helium pycnometry for effective porositymeasurements (Johnson-Maynard et al.1994) and of anoptical scanner for thermal conductivity measurements(Popov et al.1999). These parameters have been measuredand averaged for the three rock types (Brehme et al.2016;Table1). Andesite has an effective porosity of 3.7 %, apermeability of 2.1910\\n-14m2, and a thermal conductiv-ity of 1.8 W m\\n-1K-1(dry) or 2.2 W m-1K-1(saturated).Tuff has a porosity of 7.7 % but the lowest permeability of2.0910\\n-15m2and a thermal conductivity of1.6 W m\\n-1K-1(dry) or 2.1 W m-1K-1(saturated).Volcanic breccia is a permeable layer with an effectiveporosity of 10.5 %, a permeability of 2.3910\\n-14m2, anda thermal conductivity of 1.6 W m\\n-1K-1(dry) or2.5 W m\\n-1K-1(saturated). Reservoir rocks reﬂect gener-ally low matrix permeability suggesting fracture-controlledﬂuid ﬂow throughout the aquifer (Brehme et al.2016).\\nModel setup\\nModel geometryNumerical models developed for the study area representthe initial conditions of the reservoir before production orinjection start.

Governing equations for ﬂuid ﬂow and heattransport in saturated porous media are derived from con-servation principles of linear momentum, mass, and energy(DHI-Wasy2009). Details on the software and theparameterization can be found in Diersch (2014).The model geometry is a 2D vertical SW–NE trendingcross section extending 6 km in horizontal and 3 km invertical direction. The direction of the proﬁle has beenselected to cover all relevant processes in the Lahendonggeothermal ﬁeld: It cuts major faults and the productionand injection wells, which are used for temperature andpressure calibration. Furthermore, it is parallel to thegroundwater ﬂow direction, showing major ﬂuid ﬂowactivities. The homogeneous and isotropic geological lay-ers in the model are stratiﬁed nearly horizontally. Faults inthe middle of the model, striking perpendicular to the crosssection, dip with 84/C176toward a cooling pluton beneath LakeLinau. Details on structural and geological components ofthe modeled region have been presented in Brehme et al.(2014).The mesh used for the numerical simulation inFEFLOW consists of 45,264 nodes and 89,320 elementsthat are denser surrounding the faults because of expectedgradients due to parameter contrasts. Material properties ofelements are permeability, porosity, and thermal conduc-tivity and set according to laboratory measurements(Table1). However, properties of the faults and LakeLinau are slightly adapted to speciﬁc conditions. The def-initions for the modeled grids along the faults are as fol-lows: porosity is 30 % and thermal conductivity is1.8 W m\\n-1K-1. Corresponding grids for Lake Linau aredeﬁned by a porosity of 100 % and a thermal conductivityof 0.6 W m\\n-1K-1. The model simulates ﬂuid ﬂow andthermal transport in saturated media in steady state.Initial values and boundary conditionsFluid ﬂow boundary conditions in the model describegroundwater heads and recharge amounts (Table2; Fig.2).The hydraulic head at the SW model boundary is 837 mand 500 m at the NE boundary. The SW hydraulic headrepresents inﬁltration of surface water into a fault, strikingperpendicular to the model. Hydraulic head at the NEborder is adapted to borehole measurements in that area(Brehme et al.2014). Inﬁltration into the fault zones atLake Linau is described by ﬂuid ﬂux boundary conditions.The quantity is 3.0910\\n-4ms-1for the SW and1.3910\\n-6ms-1at the NE fault distributed over 40 mfault width. Groundwater recharge is set to 412 mm a\\n-1atthe NE top surface (Table2; Fig.2).

       " ' the model domain is constrained by no-ﬂow boundary atthe bottom, recharge through the surrounding fault zones,and the low hydraulic heads in the NE model area. Dis-charge of the system in the central study area is mainlytoward Lake Linau and across the NE model boundary.Initial hydraulic head for the whole model domain is500 m.The heat transport boundary conditions are time-in-variant, ﬁxed temperatures, and heat ﬂux (Table2; Fig.2).Thermal gradient is 116/C176Ckm\\n-1at the SW modelboundary, and the temperature is constant 350/C176C at thepluton. Temperature of water inﬁltrating into faults andhere mixing with shallow warm groundwater is 70/C176C,while surface groundwater recharge is at 28/C176C. Temper-ature values are obtained from ﬁeld and bore log mea-surements (Brehme et al.2014). Heat ﬂux is set to100 mW m\\n-2at the bottom model boundary (Table2;Fig.2). This value is ﬁxed based on the studies fromDelisle et al. (1998), Nagao and Uyeda (1995), and Nebenet al. (1998). Initial temperature for the model domain isset as 116/C176Ckm\\n-1, according to the local thermalgradient.Permeability determinationInitial values for permeability are deﬁned based on labo-ratory measurements (Table1). After each simulation run,modeled and measured temperature and pressure valueshave been compared at indicated observation points. Incase of poor matching (errors[10 %), permeability hasbeen adjusted until satisfactory results have been achieved.Beneath lake Linau, simulation results showed locallystrong discrepancies between modeled and measuredpressure and temperature (errors[45 %). Adjustment ofpermeability in geological layers, inﬁltration rates intofaults, or hydraulic heads did not lead to acceptable results.Only the implementation of strong permeability anisotropythroughout whole depth, i.e., an additional fault, resulted inminimization of errors (0–7 %). Implementation has beenaccomplished by mesh adaptation to ensure appropriatebehavior around the fault. By this procedure, permeabilityanisotropies have been located and characterized in detailthroughout the model.In general, deﬁning a direction-dependent permeabilityimproves the data ﬁt rather than using similar permeabili-ties in all directions. This is probably due to the fracturesincreasing the permeability mostly in vertical direction.Porosity and thermal conductivity remained constantthroughout simulation. Variation in porosity is negligiblebecause it would directly be reﬂected in permeability,while thermal conductivity differences would only affectconductive heat transport, which is not dominant in theLahendong area (Ondrak et al.1998; Brehme et al.2014).\\n\\nTable 2Boundary condition speciﬁcations and respective references of databaseType of BoundaryconditionSW model boundary SW fault Lake Cooling pluton NE fault NE model surface NE modelboundaryBottomof modelFluid ﬂowHydraulic head (m) 837 bore logmeasurementa767 surfaceelevationa500 bore logmeasurementa\\nFluid ﬂux (m s-1) 3.0 x 10-4ﬁeldmeasurementa1.3 x 10-4ﬁeldmeasurementa1.3 x 10-8calculationb\\nHeat transportTemperature (/C176C) 116/C176Ckm-1borelog measurementa70 estimationa350 bore logmeasurementa70 estimationa28 ﬁeld measurementa\\nHeat ﬂux (mW m-2)100c\\nMaterial properties See Table1aBrehme et al.

       " 'Results\\nNumerical simulation is performed to obtain the best ﬁt tothe measured data changing the absolute and relativepermeability in geological elements. Relative permeabilityrefers to different permeabilities in horizontal and verticaldirection. As a main result, a blind fault has been rec-ognized beneath Lake Linau, which has not been knownfrom former studies. Simulated pressure and temperatureare measured at ﬁve selected observation points, whichrepresent boreholes with available bore logs for pressureand temperature. Details on data are given in Fig.6. Themodel with best data ﬁt, out of 370 different models, isconsidered to generate the ﬁnal model developed forLahendong.Permeability distribution and identiﬁcationof a blind faultDistribution of permeability patterns in the reservoir hasbeen conceived comparing temperature and pressure datain several wells. Especially beneath Lake Linau, closelylocated wells show high variations in temperature andpressure. A drop of 100/C176C and 18 bar along 300 m dis-tance has been observed between well LHD 24 andLHD 28. Models ﬁrst showed high discrepancies betweenmodeled and measured values in this area. However, afterimplementing another high anisotropic permeable structurebetween the observation points, models resulted in satis-factory results. The structure has ten times higher verticalpermeability than horizontal permeability. This structure isassumed to be another fault zone located between twoknown faults with vertical dip and NW strike. This faultshows no trace at surface, because it is covered by LakeLinau.Generally, modeled permeability distribution in theLahendong reservoir is direction-dependent and overprintsthe lithology. Modeled permeability is generally higherthan measured ones in the order of up to four magnitudes.This is due to fracture patterns, which are not detectable atcore-sample scale. Permeability patterns directly affectsubsurface ﬂuid ﬂow and temperature and pressuredistribution.Permeability in the faulted zones and surroundings islowest in the study area. Especially the middle and NEfault, the shallow area beneath SW Lake Linau and thedeep NE section of the NE fault show low permeabilitiesbetween 10\\n-13and 10-14m2(Fig.3). The area betweenthe middle and NE fault, the deep section NE of the SWfault, the SW fault itself and the whole model area towardthe SW and NE boundary show higher permeabilities of10\\n-10and 10-12m2(Fig.3).Permeability varies not only within the modeled area,but also in vertical and horizontal direction. In faults andthe deep reservoir section in the NE, permeability is by afactor of 10 higher in the vertical direction than in thehorizontal direction (Fig.3). In the areas between faults,permeability is in some parts by a factor of 10–100 lower inthe vertical direction. In the rest of the model, vertical andhorizontal permeability do not differ (Fig.3).\\n\\n\\nFig. 3Final adapted permeability and anisotropy distribution throughout the model domain.

       " 'Pressure distributionThe pressure distribution in the study area is controlled bygroundwater ﬂow in low permeable rocks and verticallyhigh permeable fault zones. Isobars drop following thenatural hydraulic gradient from SW to NE. The SW sectionof the system shows higher pressures, which is caused byinﬁltration from higher elevations in the SW. Some wellsexisting in this region are of artesian-type. Overpressurereleases through high permeable zones beneath Lake Linauand discharges toward surface. The pressure drop is up to20 bars across the faults (Fig.4).Temperature distributionTemperature distribution along the Lahendong geothermalreservoir suggests that convective heat transport is thedominating process in the reservoir rocks. Isotherms gen-erally follow the SW–NE oriented ﬂow pattern, the rise andthe inﬁltration of ﬂuids. Upwelling of isotherms betweenthe faults veriﬁes water rise toward Lake Linau. Inﬁltrationof cold water causes down welling of isotherms particu-larly on the northeast section of the model. Temperature islocally increased at the bottom of the model surroundingthe pluton (Fig.4).Subsurface ﬂuid ﬂowThe absolute and horizontal/vertical permeability distri-bution controls local ﬂuid ﬂow in the Lahendong reservoir.The general ﬂuid ﬂow, driven by the natural pressuregradient, is oriented from SW to NE. Vertical inﬁltrationoccurs at faults at Lake Linau and at the SW boundary.Discharge is across the NE model boundary (Fig.5). Themore detailed ﬂow patterns can be observed with stream-lines, which show a ﬂuid ﬂow along highly permeableareas. Calculated streamlines describe particle ﬂow withinthe model domain. A forward calculation shows howinﬁltrating water at the SW model boundary distributesthrough the reservoir. The backward calculation shows thesource of ﬂuid particles arriving at the NE model boundary(Fig.5). Patterns show that hot groundwater ﬂows towardthe faults beneath Lake Linau, where the ﬂuid ﬂow isdisturbed by a rise in temperature and vertically high per-meable layers. This causes a rise of groundwater in thismodel area (red forward streamlines in Fig.5). At the sametime, cold water inﬁltrates into high permeable areas anddistributes over the NE model domain (blue backwardstreamlines in Fig.5). It is clearly seen that the composi-tion of the NE reservoir domain is dominated by coldwaterinﬁltration into faults, while the production areas arecharacterized by hot water ﬂow (Fig.5).\\nDiscussion\\nInvestigation of subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow in geothermalreservoirs is crucial for sustainable exploitation avoidingdrilling into less productive areas.

       " 'properties of water (i.e. viscosity). The inﬂuence of theseparameters on the ﬂuid ﬂow has been investigated inLahendong geothermal reservoir using hydraulic–thermalsimulations. Simulation results show the detailed perme-ability distribution in the reservoir including location of anadditional fault zone.Matching of measured and simulated temperature andpressure has been used as a tool for resolving the perme-ability distribution. Temperature and pressure have beeniteratively determined at several observation points(Fig.2). Generally, modeled values are in good agreementwith observed ones (Fig.6). Nevertheless, some observa-tion points give slightly different values for both pressureand temperature (LHD 4 and LHD 7) or only temperature(LHD 24). This is probably due to the complicated ﬂowprocesses or strong small-scale structural variation infractured and faulted areas. Furthermore, density varia-tions, which could have not been included into simulationdue to high temperatures, could cause variation of ﬂuidpressure. However, the average deviation of simulatedpressure and temperature is 1 %.Implemented model parameters are porosity, perme-ability, and heat conductivity. From those parameters, onlypermeability has been tested in a speciﬁc range duringsimulation. The inﬂuence of porosity and heat conductivityon ﬂuid ﬂow is negligible due to dominating convectiveheat ﬂow (Ondrak et al.1998). Values implemented in themodel are based on measured permeabilities, which rep-resent matrix permeability of rocks.The measured matrix permeability, representing per-meability in horizontal direction, is 1.5910\\n-14m2onaverage, which remains within typical permeability rangefor fractured igneous rocks (Scho¨n2004). Permeability forvolcanic breccias ranges typically between 3910-15and5910\\n-12m2and tuff permeabilities range between7910\\n-17and 7910-12m2(Klavetter and Peters1987).In the Wairakei geothermal ﬁeld, simulating the imper-meable layers resulted in permeabilities of 10\\n-18and10\\n-14m2, in horizontal and vertical axis, respectively(Mercer and Faust1979).However, permeability in reservoir rocks might belocally increased due to fracture formation. It might also bedecreased due to alteration and sealing in faults. InLahendong, modeled permeability can be up to four mag-nitudes higher than measured ones in faulted areas. This iscaused by fractures, which are not detectable in core scale.Moreover, in fault cores, it is by a factor of 10 higher invertical direction than in horizontal direction. However, inareas between faults (fault gauge), permeability is in someparts by a factor of 10–100 lower in the vertical direction.Adaptation of permeability ensures a ﬁt to measured tem-perature and pressure data.Permeability in fractured areas is the main factor inﬂu-encing subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow and temperature distribution inthe Lahendong reservoir area. Subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow isdriven by local hydraulic heads, which show high varia-tions at different sections of the study area. Consequently,convective heat distribution leads to high temperaturevariation along the reservoir. These phenomena areobserved in Lahendong as well as comparable ﬁelds. InNew Mexico, water level drops of 30–100 m are observedacross several fault zones (Haneberg1995).

       " 'temperature drops and upwelling of isotherms indicate thatfault zones control the ﬂuid ﬂow in the Lake Long andValentine ﬁelds, USA (Hooper1991). The analysis of ﬂuidpressure differences at the Alpine fault, New Zealand,allowed to characterize the change in permeability betweenhanging and footwall blocks (Sutherland et al.2012).In summary, high pressure or temperature gradients areindicators for ﬂuid barriers between observation points. Inother words, reservoir sections of different properties areseparated by horizontally less permeable faults. In Lahen-dong, most signiﬁcant ﬂuid barriers are faults to the SWand to the NE of Lake Linau. Across these barriers, thepressure drops up to 20 bars. A similar pattern has beenmeasured in bore logs beneath Lake Linau, where no sur-face trace of a fault had been observed in former studies.However, only by implementing another fault, modeledand measured values could have been adapted. Therecently identiﬁed fault zone beneath Lake Linau remainsunder lake water and therefore is only traceable by thiskind of reservoir modeling.Additionally to fault identiﬁcation, the internal structureof known fault zones has been understood in detail. The NEfault, i.e., shows a displacement at 2 km depth. Thedetailed trend has been understood by permeability adap-tation in this area.Due to low permeability in horizontal direction in thefaults, ﬂuids propagate mostly vertically toward the hotsprings at surface. It also allows surface water to inﬁltrateinto the reservoir in case the pressure within the fault zoneis low enough (Fig.5). This vertical ﬂuid movementeventually controls the temperature distribution in thereservoir. Upward migration of deep hot water increasesthe temperature, while inﬁltration of cold surface watercauses local drop of temperature.In summary, the most important factors inﬂuencing thereliability of numerical reservoir models are absolute anddifferent horizontal and vertical permeability. However, apermeability adaptation has been done for each geologicallayer; the vertical permeability anomalies are overprintingthose layers and are constraining the regional groundwaterﬂow. Those permeabilities of fractures directly inﬂuencethe productivity of the reservoir (Cherubini et al.2013).Therefore, their permeability characteristics should beinvestigated in detail.In a previous study, a numerical model for the Lahen-dong site has been set up in TOUGH2 and aimed at fore-casting the reservoir behavior during exploitation until theyear 2036. With a production of 60 MWe, it predicts apressure drop of 10 bars. However, the forecast results areuncertain due to lack of measured pressure draw down data(Yani2006). Accordingly, the next steps of the presentedstudy should include a realistic production and injectionscenario in order to support sustainable reservoirexploitation. Furthermore, chemical characteristics couldbe considered to achieve reliable production setups,because hydrochemical processes play an important role inthe Lahendong reservoir (Brehme et al.2016). Presentedmodels from this study provide important information onﬂuid ﬂow in the water-dominated Lahendong reservoir.However, additional two-phase ﬂow models of the\\nLHDLHDLHDLHDLHD\\n100 150 200 250 300 350 400 100 110 120 130 140 150 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 measured temeprature  [°C] \\nmodelled temperature  [°C]  100 110 120 130 140 400 \\nmodelled pressure  [bar] modelled pressure  [bar] 2428574\\nwell namedate drilling completed date of bore log  LHD 4Oct 1985 Jan 86  LHD 5May 1986 Jul 2000  LHD 7Oct 1987 Jul 96  LHD 24Jul 09 Jul 09  LHD 28Aug 09 Aug 09\\n4524287\\nwell namereservoir depth          [m] below surface  LHD 41400  LHD 51750  LHD 72100  LHD 241820  LHD 281800\\n\\nFig. 6Modeled versus measured temperature and pressure at selected observation points.

The ﬂuid ﬂowmainly depends on rock and fault zone permeability. Theseprocesses have been considered in numerical models,which simulate local temperature and pressure conditions.The numerical models represent the initial reservoirconditions, which refers to the case before productionstarts. Models are developed based on the conceptualmodels of the study area, which explain reservoir geome-try, geological structures, temperature, and hydraulic con-ditions. Temperature and pressure well-logs have beenused for model calibration.Vertical and horizontal ﬂuid ﬂow is mainly controlledby fault permeability. This characteristic is used to simu-late different reservoir sections, and vertical ﬂuid risetoward the surface. By stepwise adaptation of permeabilityﬁelds, based on observed temperature and pressure gradi-ents, an additional blind fault zone can be identiﬁedbeneath Lake Linau. Temperature and pressure signiﬁ-cantly drop across that ﬂuid barrier. This behavior has beenobserved in comparable ﬁelds in the USA as well. Theoverall shape of ﬂuid ﬂow direction trends in a SW–NEdirection. Main recharge occurs by inﬁltration of surfacewater into the faults, especially in the southwest and near toLake Linau. Discharge is enhanced in highly fracturedareas toward Lake Linau. Vertical permeability of faultsallows ﬂuids rising toward the hot springs at surface.Results show that permeability has to be considered forsimulation of a geothermal system. The geothermal systemis mainly controlled by ﬂuid ﬂow in fractures/faultsdepending on temperature and pressure conditions. Thelocally modiﬁed ﬂuid ﬂow can considerably inﬂuence theproductivity of a geothermal ﬁeld. Results also guidereservoir management in case of a potential for ﬁeldextension, as performed in Lahendong.\\nAcknowledgmentsThe authors acknowledge the continuous supportwithin the team of the International Center for Geothermal Researchunder the direction of E.

There,\\ngeothermal exploration started in the early 1970s including\\ngeophysical and geohydrochemical approaches. It\\nis a\\nwater-dominated magmatic structurally controlled system.\\nFaults generally act as across-fault ﬂuid barriers and along-\\nfault ﬂuid conductors (Brehme et al. 2014). As a result, hot\\nsprings mainly appear on the top of vertically permeable\\nfaults at the surface. Available numerous drilling and sur-\\nface measurements allowed a detailed characterization of\\nthe geological and hydrogeological setting of the area\\n(Fig. 1; Brehme et al. 2011, 2013, 2014, 2016; Wiegand\\net al. 2013). The model presented here is developed for\\ninvestigating subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow and the permeability\\ndistribution including the fault zones in the Lahendong\\ngeothermal ﬁeld. Below, the geological structure of the\\n\\nﬁeld is presented followed by an introduction to the mod-\\neling approach.\\n\\nDetailed investigation of subsurface permeability dis-\\ntribution is a crucial step for site selection and smart dril-\\nling strategies. The numerical simulations presented will\\nprovide insight into understanding the subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow\\nconsidering the hydraulic conductivity of faults. It ensures\\nproductive as well as sustainable operation of geothermal\\nﬁelds avoiding risks, such as drilling into non-fractured or\\ncold zones, and targeting highly corroding waters.\\nAlthough the target area is Lahendong, the general work-\\nﬂow is applicable for other geothermal sites consisting of\\nsimilar constraints.\\n\\nReservoir characterization\\n\\nHydrogeology\\n\\nThe overall driving force for the ﬂuid ﬂow is the SW–NE\\noriented natural hydraulic gradient\\nin the Lahendong\\ngeothermal system. The direction of ﬂuid ﬂow varies\\nthrough the geothermal site due to horizontal partitioning\\nof the reservoir by relatively less permeable fault zones\\n(Brehme et al. 2014). The basic sections are located in the\\n\\nFig. 1 Topographic map of the study area with geological features, water and rock sample locations, and model cross section\\n\\n123\\n\\n\\x0cEnviron Earth Sci (2016) 75:1088\\n\\nPage 3 of 11\\n\\n1088\\n\\nsouth, in the east, and beneath Lake Linau. Beneath Lake\\nLinau, the direction of ﬂuid ﬂow is slightly rotated to\\nWSW–ENE (Fig. 1). Also, types of ﬂuid change from one\\nsection to another, e.g., an acidic highly saline-type\\nbeneath Lake Linau and a neutral low saline-type south and\\neast of Lake Linau (Fig. 1). The impermeable structure\\nacross faults prevent the ﬂuids from diluting each other\\n(Brehme et al. 2016). However, faults are rather permeable\\nalong the vertical axis, which allows recharge of the system\\nthrough the faults. Rainwater inﬁltrates at a fault in the SW,\\nat Mt. Lengkoan, and creek water inﬁltrates into the normal\\nfaults at Lake Linau (Fig. 2). The hydrothermal system\\ndischarges into Lake Linau and toward the NE, as driven\\nby the hydraulic gradient (Brehme et al. 2014).\\n\\nThe fracture network along the area is characterized by\\nstrike slip faults and normal faults. The sinistral faults\\nstrike N 40° and steeply dip toward the SE. Left step over\\non the strike slip faults forms an extension basin in the\\ncentral study area. Normal faults at the extension basin\\nstrike NW and dip 70°–80° beneath Lake Linau (Brehme\\net al. 2014).\\n\\nLithology\\n\\nLahendong area is mainly characterized by Pre-, Post- and\\nTondano formation of Plio- to Pleistocene age (Koestono\\net al. 2010). The rocks are typically andesite, volcanic\\nbreccia, and tuff. Those types have been sampled from\\nborehole cores and used to determine porosity, permeabil-\\nity, and thermal conductivity. Effective porosity and matrix\\npermeability have been analyzed using a cylindrical-shaped\\n\\nspecimen with a dimension of 5 cm x 5 cm 9 2.5 cm ori-\\nented parallel to the coring (Brehme et al. 2016). Thermal\\nconductivity has been measured on plain sections of dried\\ncores. The experimental setup consists of a gas perme-\\nameter for determining matrix permeability (Milsch et al.\\n2011), of an helium pycnometry for effective porosity\\nmeasurements (Johnson-Maynard et al. 1994) and of an\\noptical scanner for thermal conductivity measurements\\n(Popov et al. 1999). These parameters have been measured\\nand averaged for the three rock types (Brehme et al. 2016;\\nTable 1). Andesite has an effective porosity of 3.7 %, a\\npermeability of 2.1 9 10-14 m2, and a thermal conductiv-\\nity of 1.8 W m-1 K-1 (dry) or 2.2 W m-1 K-1 (saturated).\\nTuff has a porosity of 7.7 % but the lowest permeability of\\n2.0 9 10-15 m2\\nof\\n1.6 W m-1 K-1\\n(saturated).\\nVolcanic breccia is a permeable layer with an effective\\nporosity of 10.5 %, a permeability of 2.3 9 10-14 m2, and\\na thermal conductivity of 1.6 W m-1 K-1\\n(dry) or\\n2.5 W m-1 K-1 (saturated).

However, properties of the faults and Lake\\nLinau are slightly adapted to speciﬁc conditions. The def-\\ninitions for the modeled grids along the faults are as fol-\\nlows: porosity is 30 % and thermal conductivity is\\n1.8 W m-1 K-1. Corresponding grids for Lake Linau are\\ndeﬁned by a porosity of 100 % and a thermal conductivity\\nof 0.6 W m-1 K-1.

The SW hydraulic head\\nrepresents inﬁltration of surface water into a fault, striking\\nperpendicular to the model. Hydraulic head at the NE\\nborder is adapted to borehole measurements in that area\\n(Brehme et al. 2014). Inﬁltration into the fault zones at\\nLake Linau is described by ﬂuid ﬂux boundary conditions.\\nThe quantity is 3.0 9 10-4 m s-1\\nthe SW and\\n1.3 9 10-6 m s-1 at the NE fault distributed over 40 m\\nfault width.

Temper-\\nature values are obtained from ﬁeld and bore log mea-\\nsurements (Brehme et al. 2014). Heat ﬂux is set\\nto\\n100 mW m-2 at\\nthe bottom model boundary (Table 2;\\nFig. 2). This value is ﬁxed based on the studies from\\nDelisle et al. (1998), Nagao and Uyeda (1995), and Neben\\net al. (1998).

Relative permeability\\nrefers to different permeabilities in horizontal and vertical\\ndirection. As a main result, a blind fault has been rec-\\nognized beneath Lake Linau, which has not been known\\nfrom former studies. Simulated pressure and temperature\\nare measured at ﬁve selected observation points, which\\nrepresent boreholes with available bore logs for pressure\\nand temperature. Details on data are given in Fig. 6. The\\nmodel with best data ﬁt, out of 370 different models, is\\nconsidered to generate the ﬁnal model developed for\\nLahendong.\\n\\nPermeability distribution and identiﬁcation\\nof a blind fault\\n\\nDistribution of permeability patterns in the reservoir has\\nbeen conceived comparing temperature and pressure data\\nin several wells. Especially beneath Lake Linau, closely\\nlocated wells show high variations in temperature and\\npressure. A drop of 100 °C and 18 bar along 300 m dis-\\ntance has been observed between well LHD 24 and\\nLHD 28. Models ﬁrst showed high discrepancies between\\nmodeled and measured values in this area. However, after\\nimplementing another high anisotropic permeable structure\\nbetween the observation points, models resulted in satis-\\nfactory results. The structure has ten times higher vertical\\n\\nEnviron Earth Sci (2016) 75:1088\\n\\npermeability than horizontal permeability. This structure is\\nassumed to be another fault zone located between two\\nknown faults with vertical dip and NW strike. This fault\\nshows no trace at surface, because it is covered by Lake\\nLinau.\\n\\nGenerally, modeled permeability distribution in the\\nLahendong reservoir is direction-dependent and overprints\\nthe lithology. Modeled permeability is generally higher\\nthan measured ones in the order of up to four magnitudes.\\nThis is due to fracture patterns, which are not detectable at\\ncore-sample scale. Permeability patterns directly affect\\nsubsurface ﬂuid ﬂow and temperature and pressure\\ndistribution.\\n\\nPermeability in the faulted zones and surroundings is\\nlowest in the study area. Especially the middle and NE\\nfault, the shallow area beneath SW Lake Linau and the\\ndeep NE section of the NE fault show low permeabilities\\nbetween 10-13 and 10-14 m2 (Fig. 3). The area between\\nthe middle and NE fault, the deep section NE of the SW\\nfault, the SW fault itself and the whole model area toward\\nthe SW and NE boundary show higher permeabilities of\\n10-10 and 10-12 m2 (Fig. 3).\\n\\nPermeability varies not only within the modeled area,\\nbut also in vertical and horizontal direction. In faults and\\nthe deep reservoir section in the NE, permeability is by a\\nfactor of 10 higher in the vertical direction than in the\\nhorizontal direction (Fig. 3). In the areas between faults,\\npermeability is in some parts by a factor of 10–100 lower in\\nthe vertical direction. In the rest of the model, vertical and\\nhorizontal permeability do not differ (Fig. 3).\\n\\nFig. 3 Final adapted permeability and anisotropy distribution throughout the model domain.

Isobars drop following the\\nnatural hydraulic gradient from SW to NE. The SW section\\nof the system shows higher pressures, which is caused by\\ninﬁltration from higher elevations in the SW. Some wells\\nexisting in this region are of artesian-type. Overpressure\\nreleases through high permeable zones beneath Lake Linau\\nand discharges toward surface. The pressure drop is up to\\n20 bars across the faults (Fig. 4).\\n\\nTemperature distribution\\n\\nTemperature distribution along the Lahendong geothermal\\nreservoir suggests that convective heat transport\\nis the\\ndominating process in the reservoir rocks. Isotherms gen-\\nerally follow the SW–NE oriented ﬂow pattern, the rise and\\nthe inﬁltration of ﬂuids. Upwelling of isotherms between\\nthe faults veriﬁes water rise toward Lake Linau. Inﬁltration\\nof cold water causes down welling of isotherms particu-\\nlarly on the northeast section of the model. Temperature is\\nlocally increased at the bottom of the model surrounding\\nthe pluton (Fig. 4).\\n\\nSubsurface ﬂuid ﬂow\\n\\nThe absolute and horizontal/vertical permeability distri-\\nbution controls local ﬂuid ﬂow in the Lahendong reservoir.\\n\\nThe general ﬂuid ﬂow, driven by the natural pressure\\ngradient, is oriented from SW to NE. Vertical inﬁltration\\noccurs at faults at Lake Linau and at the SW boundary.\\nDischarge is across the NE model boundary (Fig. 5). The\\nmore detailed ﬂow patterns can be observed with stream-\\nlines, which show a ﬂuid ﬂow along highly permeable\\nareas. Calculated streamlines describe particle ﬂow within\\nthe model domain. A forward calculation shows how\\ninﬁltrating water at the SW model boundary distributes\\nthrough the reservoir. The backward calculation shows the\\nsource of ﬂuid particles arriving at the NE model boundary\\n(Fig. 5). Patterns show that hot groundwater ﬂows toward\\nthe faults beneath Lake Linau, where the ﬂuid ﬂow is\\ndisturbed by a rise in temperature and vertically high per-\\nmeable layers. This causes a rise of groundwater in this\\nmodel area (red forward streamlines in Fig. 5). At the same\\ntime, cold water inﬁltrates into high permeable areas and\\ndistributes over the NE model domain (blue backward\\nstreamlines in Fig. 5). It is clearly seen that the composi-\\ntion of the NE reservoir domain is dominated by coldwater\\ninﬁltration into faults, while the production areas are\\ncharacterized by hot water ﬂow (Fig. 5).\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\nInvestigation of\\nsubsurface ﬂuid ﬂow in geothermal\\nreservoirs is crucial for sustainable exploitation avoiding\\ndrilling into less productive areas.

The inﬂuence of these\\nparameters on the ﬂuid ﬂow has been investigated in\\nLahendong geothermal reservoir using hydraulic–thermal\\nsimulations. Simulation results show the detailed perme-\\nability distribution in the reservoir including location of an\\nadditional fault zone.\\n\\nMatching of measured and simulated temperature and\\npressure has been used as a tool for resolving the perme-\\nability distribution. Temperature and pressure have been\\niteratively determined at\\nseveral observation points\\n(Fig. 2). Generally, modeled values are in good agreement\\nwith observed ones (Fig. 6). Nevertheless, some observa-\\ntion points give slightly different values for both pressure\\nand temperature (LHD 4 and LHD 7) or only temperature\\n(LHD 24). This is probably due to the complicated ﬂow\\nprocesses or strong small-scale structural variation in\\nfractured and faulted areas. Furthermore, density varia-\\ntions, which could have not been included into simulation\\ndue to high temperatures, could cause variation of ﬂuid\\npressure. However,\\nthe average deviation of simulated\\npressure and temperature is 1 %.\\n\\nImplemented model parameters are porosity, perme-\\nability, and heat conductivity. From those parameters, only\\npermeability has been tested in a speciﬁc range during\\nsimulation. The inﬂuence of porosity and heat conductivity\\non ﬂuid ﬂow is negligible due to dominating convective\\nheat ﬂow (Ondrak et al. 1998). Values implemented in the\\nmodel are based on measured permeabilities, which rep-\\nresent matrix permeability of rocks.\\n\\nThe measured matrix permeability, representing per-\\nmeability in horizontal direction, is 1.5 9 10-14 m2 on\\n\\n123\\n\\naverage, which remains within typical permeability range\\nfor fractured igneous rocks (Scho¨n 2004). Permeability for\\nvolcanic breccias ranges typically between 3 9 10-15 and\\n5 9 10-12 m2 and tuff permeabilities\\nrange between\\n7 9 10-17 and 7 9 10-12 m2 (Klavetter and Peters 1987).\\nIn the Wairakei geothermal ﬁeld, simulating the imper-\\nmeable layers resulted in permeabilities of 10-18 and\\n10-14 m2,\\nin horizontal and vertical axis, respectively\\n(Mercer and Faust 1979).\\n\\nHowever, permeability in reservoir rocks might be\\nlocally increased due to fracture formation. It might also be\\ndecreased due to alteration and sealing in faults.\\nIn\\nLahendong, modeled permeability can be up to four mag-\\nnitudes higher than measured ones in faulted areas. This is\\ncaused by fractures, which are not detectable in core scale.\\nMoreover, in fault cores, it is by a factor of 10 higher in\\nvertical direction than in horizontal direction. However, in\\nareas between faults (fault gauge), permeability is in some\\nparts by a factor of 10–100 lower in the vertical direction.\\nAdaptation of permeability ensures a ﬁt to measured tem-\\nperature and pressure data.\\n\\nPermeability in fractured areas is the main factor inﬂu-\\nencing subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow and temperature distribution in\\nthe Lahendong reservoir area. Subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow is\\ndriven by local hydraulic heads, which show high varia-\\ntions at different sections of the study area. Consequently,\\nconvective heat distribution leads to high temperature\\nvariation along the reservoir. These phenomena are\\nobserved in Lahendong as well as comparable ﬁelds.

The analysis of ﬂuid\\npressure differences at\\nthe Alpine fault, New Zealand,\\nallowed to characterize the change in permeability between\\nhanging and footwall blocks (Sutherland et al. 2012).\\n\\nIn summary, high pressure or temperature gradients are\\nindicators for ﬂuid barriers between observation points. In\\nother words, reservoir sections of different properties are\\nseparated by horizontally less permeable faults. In Lahen-\\ndong, most signiﬁcant ﬂuid barriers are faults to the SW\\nand to the NE of Lake Linau. Across these barriers, the\\npressure drops up to 20 bars. A similar pattern has been\\nmeasured in bore logs beneath Lake Linau, where no sur-\\nface trace of a fault had been observed in former studies.\\nHowever, only by implementing another fault, modeled\\nand measured values could have been adapted. The\\nrecently identiﬁed fault zone beneath Lake Linau remains\\nunder lake water and therefore is only traceable by this\\nkind of reservoir modeling.\\n\\nAdditionally to fault identiﬁcation, the internal structure\\nof known fault zones has been understood in detail. The NE\\nfault,\\ni.e., shows a displacement at 2 km depth. The\\ndetailed trend has been understood by permeability adap-\\ntation in this area.\\n\\nDue to low permeability in horizontal direction in the\\nfaults, ﬂuids propagate mostly vertically toward the hot\\nsprings at surface. It also allows surface water to inﬁltrate\\ninto the reservoir in case the pressure within the fault zone\\nis low enough (Fig. 5). This vertical ﬂuid movement\\n\\neventually controls the temperature distribution in the\\nreservoir. Upward migration of deep hot water increases\\nthe temperature, while inﬁltration of cold surface water\\ncauses local drop of temperature.\\n\\nIn summary, the most important factors inﬂuencing the\\nreliability of numerical reservoir models are absolute and\\ndifferent horizontal and vertical permeability. However, a\\npermeability adaptation has been done for each geological\\nlayer; the vertical permeability anomalies are overprinting\\nthose layers and are constraining the regional groundwater\\nﬂow. Those permeabilities of fractures directly inﬂuence\\nthe productivity of the reservoir (Cherubini et al. 2013).\\nTherefore,\\ntheir permeability characteristics should be\\ninvestigated in detail.\\n\\nIn a previous study, a numerical model for the Lahen-\\ndong site has been set up in TOUGH2 and aimed at fore-\\ncasting the reservoir behavior during exploitation until the\\nyear 2036. With a production of 60 MWe, it predicts a\\npressure drop of 10 bars. However, the forecast results are\\nuncertain due to lack of measured pressure draw down data\\n(Yani 2006). Accordingly, the next steps of the presented\\nstudy should include a realistic production and injection\\nscenario in order\\nreservoir\\nexploitation. Furthermore, chemical characteristics could\\nbe considered to achieve reliable production setups,\\nbecause hydrochemical processes play an important role in\\nthe Lahendong reservoir (Brehme et al. 2016).

The ﬂuid ﬂow\\nmainly depends on rock and fault zone permeability.

Models are developed based on the conceptual\\nmodels of the study area, which explain reservoir geome-\\ntry, geological structures, temperature, and hydraulic con-\\nditions.

This characteristic is used to simu-\\nlate different reservoir sections, and vertical ﬂuid rise\\ntoward the surface. By stepwise adaptation of permeability\\nﬁelds, based on observed temperature and pressure gradi-\\nents, an additional blind fault zone can be identiﬁed\\nbeneath Lake Linau. Temperature and pressure signiﬁ-\\ncantly drop across that ﬂuid barrier. This behavior has been\\nobserved in comparable ﬁelds in the USA as well. The\\noverall shape of ﬂuid ﬂow direction trends in a SW–NE\\ndirection. Main recharge occurs by inﬁltration of surface\\nwater into the faults, especially in the southwest and near to\\nLake Linau. Discharge is enhanced in highly fractured\\nareas toward Lake Linau. Vertical permeability of faults\\nallows ﬂuids rising toward the hot springs at surface.\\n\\nResults show that permeability has to be considered for\\nsimulation of a geothermal system. The geothermal system\\nis mainly controlled by ﬂuid ﬂow in fractures/faults\\ndepending on temperature and pressure conditions. The\\nlocally modiﬁed ﬂuid ﬂow can considerably inﬂuence the\\nproductivity of a geothermal ﬁeld. Results also guide\\nreservoir management\\nin case of a potential for ﬁeld\\nextension, as performed in Lahendong.\\n\\nAcknowledgments The authors acknowledge the continuous support\\nwithin the team of the International Center for Geothermal Research\\nunder the direction of E.

temperature gradients are\\nindicators for ﬂuid barriers between observation points. in\\nother words, reservoir sections of different properties are\\nseparated by horizontally less permeable faults. in lahendong, most signiﬁcant ﬂuid barriers are faults to the sw\\nand to the ne of lake linau. across these barriers, the\\npressure drops up to 20 bars. a similar pattern has been\\nmeasured in bore logs beneath lake linau, where no surface trace of a fault had been observed in former studies.\\nhowever, only by implementing another fault, modeled\\nand measured values could have been adapted. the\\nrecently identiﬁed fault zone beneath lake linau remains\\nunder lake water and therefore is only traceable by this\\nkind of reservoir modeling.\\n\\nadditionally to fault identiﬁcation, the internal structure\\nof known fault zones has been understood in detail. the ne\\nfault,\\ni.e., shows a displacement at 2 km depth. the\\ndetailed trend has been understood by permeability adaptation in this area.\\n\\ndue to low permeability in horizontal direction in the\\nfaults, ﬂuids propagate mostly vertically toward the hot\\nsprings at surface. it also allows surface water to inﬁltrate\\ninto the reservoir in case the pressure within the fault zone\\nis low enough (fig. 5). this vertical ﬂuid movement\\n\\neventually controls the temperature distribution in the\\nreservoir. upward migration of deep hot water increases\\nthe temperature, while inﬁltration of cold surface water\\ncauses local drop of temperature.\\n\\nin summary, the most important factors inﬂuencing the\\nreliability of numerical reservoir models are absolute and\\ndifferent horizontal and vertical permeability. however, a\\npermeability adaptation has been done for each geological\\nlayer; the vertical permeability anomalies are overprinting\\nthose layers and are constraining the regional groundwater\\nﬂow. those permeabilities of fractures directly inﬂuence\\nthe

(2001). additionally, there are several sites exemplifying similar characteristics as in lahendong. the underground movement of hot and cold ﬂuids has been modeled for geothermal ﬁelds in new zealand (kaya et al. 2014). the kakkonda geothermal site, e.g., consists of two reservoirs at various depths with different ﬂuid properties. there, results from ﬂuid ﬂow analysis show the importance of fractures for ﬂuid transport enhancing the recharge or discharge in the reservoir  123  \\x0c1088 page 2 of 11  environ earth sci (2016) 75:1088  (mcguinness et al. 1995). generally, faults acting as preferential ﬂuid path ways signiﬁcantly change the pressure and temperature ﬁeld in the reservoir (cherubini et al. 2013). models for the seferihisar–balc¸ova ﬁeld focus on the ﬂuid ﬂow inside of faults. results show an enhanced upward heat transport through ﬂuids from bottom of the geothermal system (magri et al. 2011).  our test ground is the lahendong geothermal ﬁeld located in sulawesi, indonesia. the ﬁeld is owned and operated by p.t. pertamina geothermal energy and hosts a power plant with a production capacity of 80 mwe. there, geothermal exploration started in the early 1970s including geophysical and geohydrochemical approaches. it is a water-dominated magmatic structurally controlled system. faults generally act as across-fault ﬂuid barriers and alongfault ﬂuid conductors (brehme et al. 2014). as a result, hot springs mainly appear on the top of vertically permeable faults at the surface. available numerous drilling and surface measurements allowed a detailed characterization of the geological and hydrogeological setting of the area (fig. 1; brehme et al. 2011, 2013, 2014, 2016; wiegand et al. 2013). the model presented here is developed for investigating subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow and the permeability distribution including the fault zones in the lahendong geothermal ﬁeld. below, the geological structure of the  ﬁeld is presented followed by an introduction to the modeling approach.  detailed investigation of subsurface permeability distribution is a crucial step for site selection and smart drilling strategies. the numerical simulations presented will provide insight into understanding the subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow considering the hydraulic conductivity of faults. it ensures productive as well as sustainable operation of geothermal ﬁelds avoiding risks, such as drilling into non-fractured or cold zones, and targeting highly corroding waters. although the target area is lahendong, the general workﬂow is applicable for other geothermal sites consisting of similar constraints.  reservoir characterization  hydrogeology  the overall driving force for the ﬂuid ﬂow is the sw–ne oriented natural hydraulic gradient in the lahendong geothermal system. the direction of ﬂuid ﬂow varies through the geothermal site due to horizontal partitioning of the reservoir by relatively less permeable fault zones (brehme et al. 2014). the basic sections are located in the  fig. 1 topographic map of the study area with geological features, water and rock sample locations, and model cross section  123  \\x0cenviron earth sci (2016) 75:1088  page 3 of 11  1088  south, in the east, and beneath lake linau. beneath lake linau, the direction of ﬂuid ﬂow is slightly rotated to wsw–ene (fig. 1). also, types of ﬂuid change from one section to another, e.g., an acidic highly saline-type beneath lake linau and a neutral low saline-type south and east of lake linau (fig. 1). the impermeable structure across faults prevent the ﬂuids from diluting each other (brehme et al. 2016). however, faults are rather permeable along the vertical axis, which allows recharge of the system through the faults. rainwater inﬁltrates at a fault in the sw, at mt. lengkoan, and creek water inﬁltrates into the normal faults at lake linau (fig. 2). the hydrothermal system discharges into lake linau and toward the ne, as driven by the hydraulic gradient (brehme et al. 2014).  the fracture network along the area is characterized by strike slip faults and normal faults. the sinistral faults strike n 40° and steeply dip toward the se. left step over on the strike slip faults forms an extension basin in the central study area. normal faults at the extension basin strike nw and dip 70°–80° beneath lake linau (brehme et al. 2014).  lithology  lahendong area is mainly characterized by pre-, post- and tondano formation of plio- to pleistocene age (koestono et al. 2010). the rocks are typically andesite, volcanic breccia, and tuff. those types have been sampled from borehole cores and used to determine porosity, permeability, and thermal conductivity. effective porosity and matrix permeability have been analyzed using a cylindrical-shaped  specimen with a dimension of 5 cm x 5 cm 9 2.5 cm oriented parallel to the coring (brehme et al. 2016). thermal conductivity has been measured on plain sections of dried cores. the experimental setup consists of a gas permeameter for determining matrix permeability (milsch et al. 2011), of an helium pycnometry for effective porosity measurements (johnson-maynard et al. 1994) and of an optical scanner for thermal conductivity measurements (popov et al. 1999). these parameters have been measured and averaged for the three rock types (brehme et al. 2016; table 1). andesite has an effective porosity of 3.7 %, a permeability of 2.1 9 10-14 m2, and a thermal conductivity of 1.8 w m-1 k-1 (dry) or 2.2 w m-1 k-1 (saturated). tuff has a porosity of 7.7 % but the lowest permeability of 2.0 9 10-15 m2 of 1.6 w m-1 k-1 (saturated). volcanic breccia is a permeable layer with an effective porosity of 10.5 %, a permeability of 2.3 9 10-14 m2, and a thermal conductivity of 1.6 w m-1 k-1 (dry) or 2.5 w m-1 k-1 (saturated). reservoir rocks reﬂect generally low matrix permeability suggesting fracture-controlled ﬂuid ﬂow throughout the aquifer (brehme et al. 2016).  and (dry) or 2.1 w m-1 k-1  a  thermal  conductivity  model setup  model geometry  numerical models developed for the study area represent the initial conditions of the reservoir before production or the commercial ﬁnite injection start. for simulation,  fig. 2 cross section of the modeled area with geological structure, boundary conditions, and location of observation points  123  \\x0c1088 page 4 of 11  environ earth sci (2016) 75:1088  table 1 thermal and hydraulic parameters of the lahendong reservoir rocks measured in laboratory (brehme et al. 2016)  sample (name, depth)  rock type  effective porosity (%)  thermal conductivity dry (w m-1 k-1)  thermal conductivity saturated (w m-1 k-1)  matrix permeability (m2)  lhd1 500–501  lhd1 801–802  lhd1 1000–1001  lhd1 2100–2101  lhd2 300–302  lhd3 2201–2203  lhd4 652–653  lhd4 850–852  lhd4 1001–1002  lhd4 2304–2305  lhd5 602–603  lhd5 752–753  lhd5 1102–1103  lhd5 1404–1406  lhd5 1575–1576  lhd7 901–902,3  lhd7 1567.8–1568  lhd7 1756–1758  average values  a  b  t  t  a  b  b  a  b  a  b  a  a  a  a  a  t  b  andesite (a)  breccia (b)  tuff (t)  1.1  14.5  5.0  7.2  12.5  5.7  6.3  1.6  16.4  1.6  16.3  2.7  5.2  3.6  0.6  4.6  11.0  3.9  3.7  10.5  7.7  (lhd1 550) 2.0  (lhd1 550) 2.2  1.6  1.8  1.4  2.1  1.8  1.4  1.8  1.4  1.9  1.5  1.6  2.1  1.8  1.6  1.6  2.4  2.2  2.0  2.4  2.0  2.7  2.7  2.3  2.3  1.7  2.2  2.7  2.2  2.5  2.1  1.5 9 10-14 8.9 9 10-16 3.3 9 10-15 6.1 9 10-14 1.5 9 10-14 1.3 9 10-14 2.3 9 10-14 6.8 9 10-14 3.4 9 10-16 1.1 9 10-14 1.1 9 10-16 7.9 9 10-14 3.0 9 10-15 7.9 9 10-18 7.2 9 10-16 1.7 9 10-15 1.7 9 10-14 2.1 9 10-14 2.3 9 10-14 2.0 9 10-15  element software feflow is used to model pressuredriven and thermally induced ﬂuid ﬂow including viscosity changes. governing equations for ﬂuid ﬂow and heat transport in saturated porous media are derived from conservation principles of linear momentum, mass, and energy (dhi-wasy 2009). details on the software and the parameterization can be found in diersch (2014).  the model geometry is a 2d vertical sw–ne trending cross section extending 6 km in horizontal and 3 km in vertical direction. the direction of the proﬁle has been selected to cover all relevant processes in the lahendong geothermal ﬁeld: it cuts major faults and the production and injection wells, which are used for temperature and pressure calibration. furthermore, to the groundwater ﬂow direction, showing major ﬂuid ﬂow activities. the homogeneous and isotropic geological layers in the model are stratiﬁed nearly horizontally. faults in the middle of the model, striking perpendicular to the cross section, dip with 84° toward a cooling pluton beneath lake linau. details on structural and geological components of the modeled region have been presented in brehme et al. (2014).  is parallel  it  the numerical  the mesh used for  simulation in feflow consists of 45,264 nodes and 89,320 elements that are denser surrounding the faults because of expected gradients due to parameter contrasts. material properties of  123  elements are permeability, porosity, and thermal conductivity and set according to laboratory measurements (table 1). however, properties of the faults and lake linau are slightly adapted to speciﬁc conditions. the definitions for the modeled grids along the faults are as follows: porosity is 30 % and thermal conductivity is 1.8 w m-1 k-1. corresponding grids for lake linau are deﬁned by a porosity of 100 % and a thermal conductivity of 0.6 w m-1 k-1. the model simulates ﬂuid ﬂow and thermal transport in saturated media in steady state.  initial values and boundary conditions  fluid ﬂow boundary conditions in the model describe groundwater heads and recharge amounts (table 2; fig. 2). the hydraulic head at the sw model boundary is 837 m and 500 m at the ne boundary. the sw hydraulic head represents inﬁltration of surface water into a fault, striking perpendicular to the model. hydraulic head at the ne border is adapted to borehole measurements in that area (brehme et al. 2014). inﬁltration into the fault zones at lake linau is described by ﬂuid ﬂux boundary conditions. the quantity is 3.0 9 10-4 m s-1 the sw and 1.3 9 10-6 m s-1 at the ne fault distributed over 40 m fault width. groundwater recharge is set to 412 mm a-1 at the ne top surface (table 2; fig. 2). fluid movement in  for  \\x0cthe model domain is constrained by no-ﬂow boundary at the bottom, recharge through the surrounding fault zones, and the low hydraulic heads in the ne model area. discharge of the system in the central study area is mainly toward lake linau and across the ne model boundary. initial hydraulic head for the whole model domain is 500 m.  the heat  is 116 °c km-1 at  transport boundary conditions are time-invariant, ﬁxed temperatures, and heat ﬂux (table 2; fig. 2). thermal gradient the sw model boundary, and the temperature is constant 350 °c at the pluton. temperature of water inﬁltrating into faults and here mixing with shallow warm groundwater is 70 °c, while surface groundwater recharge is at 28 °c. temperature values are obtained from ﬁeld and bore log measurements (brehme et al. 2014). heat ﬂux is set to 100 mw m-2 at the bottom model boundary (table 2; fig. 2). this value is ﬁxed based on the studies from delisle et al. (1998), nagao and uyeda (1995), and neben et al. (1998). initial temperature for the model domain is set as 116 °c km-1, according to the local thermal gradient.  permeability determination  initial values for permeability are deﬁned based on laboratory measurements (table 1). after each simulation run, modeled and measured temperature and pressure values have been compared at indicated observation points. in case of poor matching (errors [10 %), permeability has been adjusted until satisfactory results have been achieved. beneath lake linau, simulation results showed locally strong discrepancies between modeled and measured pressure and temperature (errors [45 %). adjustment of permeability in geological inﬁltration rates into faults, or hydraulic heads did not lead to acceptable results. only the implementation of strong permeability anisotropy throughout whole depth, i.e., an additional fault, resulted in minimization of errors (0–7 %). implementation has been accomplished by mesh adaptation to ensure appropriate behavior around the fault. by this procedure, permeability anisotropies have been located and characterized in detail throughout the model.  layers,  in general, deﬁning a direction-dependent permeability improves the data ﬁt rather than using similar permeabilities in all directions. this is probably due to the fractures increasing the permeability mostly in vertical direction.  porosity and thermal conductivity remained constant throughout simulation. variation in porosity is negligible because it would directly be reﬂected in permeability, while thermal conductivity differences would only affect conductive heat transport, which is not dominant in the lahendong area (ondrak et al. 1998; brehme et al. 2014).  123  100c  measurementa  500borelog  ofmodel bottom  boundary

performed to obtain the best ﬁt to the measured data changing the absolute and relative permeability in geological elements. relative permeability refers to different permeabilities in horizontal and vertical direction. as a main result, a blind fault has been recognized beneath lake linau, which has not been known from former studies. simulated pressure and temperature are measured at ﬁve selected observation points, which represent boreholes with available bore logs for pressure and temperature. details on data are given in fig. 6. the model with best data ﬁt, out of 370 different models, is considered to generate the ﬁnal model developed for lahendong.  permeability distribution and identiﬁcation of a blind fault  distribution of permeability patterns in the reservoir has been conceived comparing temperature and pressure data in several wells. especially beneath lake linau, closely located wells show high variations in temperature and pressure. a drop of 100 °c and 18 bar along 300 m distance has been observed between well lhd 24 and lhd 28. models ﬁrst showed high discrepancies between modeled and measured values in this area. however, after implementing another high anisotropic permeable structure between the observation points, models resulted in satisfactory results. the structure has ten times higher vertical  environ earth sci (2016) 75:1088  permeability than horizontal permeability. this structure is assumed to be another fault zone located between two known faults with vertical dip and nw strike. this fault shows no trace at surface, because it is covered by lake linau.  generally, modeled permeability distribution in the lahendong reservoir is direction-dependent and overprints the lithology. modeled permeability is generally higher than measured ones in the order of up to four magnitudes. this is due to fracture patterns, which are not detectable at core-sample scale. permeability patterns directly affect subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow and temperature and pressure distribution.  permeability in the faulted zones and surroundings is lowest in the study area. especially the middle and ne fault, the shallow area beneath sw lake linau and the deep ne section of the ne fault show low permeabilities between 10-13 and 10-14 m2 (fig. 3). the area between the middle and ne fault, the deep section ne of the sw fault, the sw fault itself and the whole model area toward the sw and ne boundary show higher permeabilities of 10-10 and 10-12 m2 (fig. 3).  permeability varies not only within the modeled area, but also in vertical and horizontal direction. in faults and the deep reservoir section in the ne, permeability is by a factor of 10 higher in the vertical direction than in the horizontal direction (fig. 3). in the areas between faults, permeability is in some parts by a factor of 10–100 lower in the vertical direction. in the rest of the model, vertical and horizontal permeability do not differ (fig. 3).  fig. 3 final

suggests that convective heat transport is the dominating process in the reservoir rocks. isotherms generally follow the sw–ne oriented ﬂow pattern, the rise and the inﬁltration of ﬂuids. upwelling of isotherms between the faults veriﬁes water rise toward lake linau. inﬁltration of cold water causes down welling of isotherms particularly on the northeast section of the model. temperature is locally increased at the bottom of the model surrounding the pluton (fig. 4).  subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow  the absolute and horizontal/vertical permeability distribution controls local ﬂuid ﬂow in the lahendong reservoir.  the general ﬂuid ﬂow, driven by the natural pressure gradient, is oriented from sw to ne. vertical inﬁltration occurs at faults at lake linau and at the sw boundary. discharge is across the ne model boundary (fig. 5). the more detailed ﬂow patterns can be observed with streamlines, which show a ﬂuid ﬂow along highly permeable areas. calculated streamlines describe particle ﬂow within the model domain. a forward calculation shows how inﬁltrating water at the sw model boundary distributes through the reservoir. the backward calculation shows the source of ﬂuid particles arriving at the ne model boundary (fig. 5). patterns show that hot groundwater ﬂows toward the faults beneath lake linau, where the ﬂuid ﬂow is disturbed by a rise in temperature and vertically high permeable layers. this causes a rise of groundwater in this model area (red forward streamlines in fig. 5). at the same time, cold water inﬁltrates into high permeable areas and distributes over the ne model domain (blue backward streamlines in fig. 5). it is clearly seen that the composition of the ne reservoir domain is dominated by coldwater inﬁltration into faults, while the production areas are characterized by hot water ﬂow (fig. 5).  discussion  investigation of subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow in geothermal reservoirs is crucial for sustainable exploitation avoiding drilling into less productive areas. subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow might be locally inﬂuenced by fault zones or physical  123  \\x0c1088 page 8 of 11  environ earth sci (2016) 75:1088  fig. 5 model domain with calculated streamlines, in

water (i.e. viscosity). the inﬂuence of these parameters on the ﬂuid ﬂow has been investigated in lahendong geothermal reservoir using hydraulic–thermal simulations. simulation results show the detailed permeability distribution in the reservoir including location of an additional fault zone.  matching of measured and simulated temperature and pressure has been used as a tool for resolving the permeability distribution. temperature and pressure have been iteratively determined at several observation points (fig. 2). generally, modeled values are in good agreement with observed ones (fig. 6). nevertheless, some observation points give slightly different values for both pressure and temperature (lhd 4 and lhd 7) or only temperature (lhd 24). this is probably due to the complicated ﬂow processes or strong small-scale structural variation in fractured and faulted areas. furthermore, density variations, which could have not been included into simulation due to high temperatures, could cause variation of ﬂuid pressure. however, the average deviation of simulated pressure and temperature is 1 %.  implemented model parameters are porosity, permeability, and heat conductivity. from those parameters, only permeability has been tested in a speciﬁc range during simulation. the inﬂuence of porosity and heat conductivity on ﬂuid ﬂow is negligible due to dominating convective heat ﬂow (ondrak et al. 1998). values implemented in the model are based on measured permeabilities, which represent matrix permeability of rocks.  the measured matrix permeability, representing permeability in horizontal direction, is 1.5 9 10-14 m2 on  123  average, which remains within typical permeability range for fractured igneous rocks (scho¨n 2004). permeability for volcanic breccias ranges typically between 3 9 10-15 and 5 9 10-12 m2 and tuff permeabilities range between 7 9 10-17 and 7 9 10-12 m2 (klavetter and peters 1987). in the wairakei geothermal ﬁeld, simulating the impermeable layers resulted in permeabilities of 10-18 and 10-14 m2, in horizontal and vertical axis, respectively (mercer and faust 1979).  however, permeability in reservoir rocks might be locally increased due to fracture formation. it might also be decreased due to alteration and sealing in faults. in lahendong, modeled permeability can be up to four magnitudes higher than measured ones in faulted areas. this is caused by fractures, which are not detectable in core scale. moreover, in fault cores, it is by a factor of 10 higher in vertical direction than in horizontal direction. however, in areas between faults (fault gauge), permeability is in some parts by a factor of 10–100 lower in the vertical direction. adaptation of permeability ensures a ﬁt to measured temperature and pressure data.  permeability in fractured areas is the main factor inﬂuencing subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow and temperature distribution in the lahendong reservoir area. subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow is driven by local hydraulic heads, which show high variations at different sections of the study area. consequently, convective heat distribution leads to high temperature variation along the reservoir. these phenomena are observed in lahendong as well as comparable ﬁelds. in new mexico, water level drops of 30–100 m are observed across (haneberg 1995). high  several  fault  zones  \\x0c123  environ earth sci (2016)

al. (2014)  temperature drops and upwelling of isotherms indicate that fault zones control the ﬂuid ﬂow in the lake long and valentine ﬁelds, usa (hooper 1991). the analysis of ﬂuid pressure differences at the alpine fault, new zealand, allowed to characterize the change in permeability between hanging and footwall blocks (sutherland et al. 2012).  in summary, high pressure or temperature gradients are indicators for ﬂuid barriers between observation points. in other words, reservoir sections of different properties are separated by horizontally less permeable faults. in lahendong, most signiﬁcant ﬂuid barriers are faults to the sw and to the ne of lake linau. across these barriers, the pressure drops up to 20 bars. a similar pattern has been measured in bore logs beneath lake linau, where no surface trace of a fault had been observed in former studies. however, only by implementing another fault, modeled and measured values could have been adapted. the recently identiﬁed fault zone beneath lake linau remains under lake water and therefore is only traceable by this kind of reservoir modeling.  additionally to fault identiﬁcation, the internal structure of known fault zones has been understood in detail. the ne fault, i.e., shows a displacement at 2 km depth. the detailed trend has been understood by permeability adaptation in this area.  due to low permeability in horizontal direction in the faults, ﬂuids propagate mostly vertically toward the hot springs at surface. it also allows surface water to inﬁltrate into the reservoir in case the pressure within the fault zone is low enough (fig. 5). this vertical ﬂuid movement  eventually controls the temperature distribution in the reservoir. upward migration of deep hot water increases the temperature, while inﬁltration of cold surface water causes local drop of temperature.  in summary, the most important factors inﬂuencing the reliability of numerical reservoir models are absolute and different horizontal and vertical permeability. however, a permeability adaptation has been done for each geological layer; the vertical permeability anomalies are overprinting those layers and are constraining the regional groundwater ﬂow. those permeabilities of fractures directly inﬂuence the productivity of the reservoir (cherubini et al. 2013). therefore, their permeability characteristics should be investigated in detail.  in a previous study, a numerical model for the lahendong site has been set up in tough2 and aimed at forecasting the reservoir behavior during exploitation until the year 2036. with a production of 60 mwe, it predicts a pressure drop of 10 bars. however, the forecast results are uncertain due to lack of measured pressure draw down data (yani 2006). accordingly, the next steps of the presented study should include a realistic production and injection scenario in order reservoir exploitation. furthermore, chemical characteristics could be considered to achieve reliable production setups, because hydrochemical processes play an important role in the lahendong reservoir (brehme et al. 2016). presented models from this study provide important information on ﬂuid ﬂow in the water-dominated lahendong reservoir. however, additional the  two-phase ﬂow models of  to support  sustainable  \\x0c1088 page 10 of 11  environ earth sci (2016) 75:1088  lahendong

permeability patterns on subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow in geothermal reservoirs. the ﬂuid ﬂow mainly depends on rock and fault zone permeability. these processes have been considered in numerical models, which simulate local temperature and pressure conditions. the initial reservoir conditions, which refers to the case before production starts. models are developed based on the conceptual models of the

recharge occurs by inﬁltration of surface water into the faults, especially in the southwest and near to lake linau. discharge is enhanced in highly fractured areas toward lake linau. vertical permeability of faults allows ﬂuids rising toward the hot springs at surface.  results show that permeability has to be considered for simulation of a geothermal system. the geothermal system is mainly controlled by ﬂuid ﬂow in fractures/faults depending on temperature and pressure conditions. the locally modiﬁed ﬂuid ﬂow can considerably inﬂuence the productivity of a geothermal ﬁeld. results also guide reservoir management in case of a potential for ﬁeld extension, as performed in lahendong.  acknowledgments the authors acknowledge the continuous support within the team of the

(2001). additionally, there are several sites exemplifying similar characteristics as in lahendong. the underground movement of hot and cold ﬂuids has been modeled for geothermal ﬁelds in new zealand (kaya et al. 2014). the kakkonda geothermal site, e.g., consists of two reservoirs at various depths with different ﬂuid properties. there, results from ﬂuid ﬂow analysis show the importance of fractures for ﬂuid transport enhancing the recharge or discharge in the reservoir  123  \\x0c1088 page 2 of 11  environ earth sci (2016) 75:1088  (mcguinness et al. 1995). generally, faults acting as preferential ﬂuid path ways signiﬁcantly change the pressure and temperature ﬁeld in the reservoir (cherubini et al. 2013). models for the seferihisar–balc¸ova ﬁeld focus on the ﬂuid ﬂow inside of faults. results show an enhanced upward heat transport through ﬂuids from bottom of the geothermal system (magri et al. 2011).  our test ground is the lahendong geothermal ﬁeld located in sulawesi, indonesia. the ﬁeld is owned and operated by p.t. pertamina geothermal energy and hosts a power plant with a production capacity of 80 mwe. there, geothermal exploration started in the early 1970s including geophysical and geohydrochemical approaches. it is a water-dominated magmatic structurally controlled system. faults generally act as across-fault ﬂuid barriers and alongfault ﬂuid conductors (brehme et al. 2014). as a result, hot springs mainly appear on the top of vertically permeable faults at the surface. available numerous drilling and surface measurements allowed a detailed characterization of the geological and hydrogeological setting of the area (fig. 1; brehme et al. 2011, 2013, 2014, 2016; wiegand et al. 2013). the model presented here is developed for investigating subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow and the permeability distribution including the fault zones in the lahendong geothermal ﬁeld. below, the geological structure of the  ﬁeld is presented followed by an introduction to the modeling approach.  detailed investigation of subsurface permeability distribution is a crucial step for site selection and smart drilling strategies. the numerical simulations presented will provide insight into understanding the subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow considering the hydraulic conductivity of faults. it ensures productive as well as sustainable operation of geothermal ﬁelds avoiding risks, such as drilling into non-fractured or cold zones, and targeting highly corroding waters. although the target area is lahendong, the general workﬂow is applicable for other geothermal sites consisting of similar constraints.  reservoir characterization  hydrogeology  the overall driving force for the ﬂuid ﬂow is the sw–ne oriented natural hydraulic gradient in the lahendong geothermal system. the direction of ﬂuid ﬂow varies through the geothermal site due to horizontal partitioning of the reservoir by relatively less permeable fault zones (brehme et al. 2014). the basic sections are located in the  fig. 1 topographic map of the study area with geological features, water and rock sample locations, and model cross section  123  \\x0cenviron earth sci (2016) 75:1088  page 3 of 11  1088  south, in the east, and beneath lake linau. beneath lake linau, the direction of ﬂuid ﬂow is slightly rotated to wsw–ene (fig. 1). also, types of ﬂuid change from one section to another, e.g., an acidic highly saline-type beneath lake linau and a neutral low saline-type south and east of lake linau (fig. 1). the impermeable structure across faults prevent the ﬂuids from diluting each other (brehme et al. 2016). however, faults are rather permeable along the vertical axis, which allows recharge of the system through the faults. rainwater inﬁltrates at a fault in the sw, at mt. lengkoan, and creek water inﬁltrates into the normal faults at lake linau (fig. 2). the hydrothermal system discharges into lake linau and toward the ne, as driven by the hydraulic gradient (brehme et al. 2014).  the fracture network along the area is characterized by strike slip faults and normal faults. the sinistral faults strike n 40° and steeply dip toward the se. left step over on the strike slip faults forms an extension basin in the central study area. normal faults at the extension basin strike nw and dip 70°–80° beneath lake linau (brehme et al. 2014).  lithology  lahendong area is mainly characterized by pre-, post- and tondano formation of plio- to pleistocene age (koestono et al. 2010). the rocks are typically andesite, volcanic breccia, and tuff. those types have been sampled from borehole cores and used to determine porosity, permeability, and thermal conductivity. effective porosity and matrix permeability have been analyzed using a cylindrical-shaped  specimen with a dimension of 5 cm x 5 cm 9 2.5 cm oriented parallel to the coring (brehme et al. 2016). thermal conductivity has been measured on plain sections of dried cores. the experimental setup consists of a gas permeameter for determining matrix permeability (milsch et al. 2011), of an helium pycnometry for effective porosity measurements (johnson-maynard et al. 1994) and of an optical scanner for thermal conductivity measurements (popov et al. 1999). these parameters have been measured and averaged for the three rock types (brehme et al. 2016; table 1). andesite has an effective porosity of 3.7 %, a permeability of 2.1 9 10-14 m2, and a thermal conductivity of 1.8 w m-1 k-1 (dry) or 2.2 w m-1 k-1 (saturated). tuff has a porosity of 7.7 % but the lowest permeability of 2.0 9 10-15 m2 of 1.6 w m-1 k-1 (saturated). volcanic breccia is a permeable layer with an effective porosity of 10.5 %, a permeability of 2.3 9 10-14 m2, and a thermal conductivity of 1.6 w m-1 k-1 (dry) or 2.5 w m-1 k-1 (saturated). reservoir rocks reﬂect generally low matrix permeability suggesting fracture-controlled ﬂuid ﬂow throughout the aquifer (brehme et al. 2016).  and (dry) or 2.1 w m-1 k-1  a  thermal  conductivity  model setup  model geometry  numerical models developed for the study area represent the initial conditions of the reservoir before production or the commercial ﬁnite injection start. for simulation,  fig. 2 cross section of the modeled area with geological structure, boundary conditions, and location of observation points  123  \\x0c1088 page 4 of 11  environ earth sci (2016) 75:1088  table 1 thermal and hydraulic parameters of the lahendong reservoir rocks measured in laboratory (brehme et al. 2016)  sample (name, depth)  rock type  effective porosity (%)  thermal conductivity dry (w m-1 k-1)  thermal conductivity saturated (w m-1 k-1)  matrix permeability (m2)  lhd1 500–501  lhd1 801–802  lhd1 1000–1001  lhd1 2100–2101  lhd2 300–302  lhd3 2201–2203  lhd4 652–653  lhd4 850–852  lhd4 1001–1002  lhd4 2304–2305  lhd5 602–603  lhd5 752–753  lhd5 1102–1103  lhd5 1404–1406  lhd5 1575–1576  lhd7 901–902,3  lhd7 1567.8–1568  lhd7 1756–1758  average values  a  b  t  t  a  b  b  a  b  a  b  a  a  a  a  a  t  b  andesite (a)  breccia (b)  tuff (t)  1.1  14.5  5.0  7.2  12.5  5.7  6.3  1.6  16.4  1.6  16.3  2.7  5.2  3.6  0.6  4.6  11.0  3.9  3.7  10.5  7.7  (lhd1 550) 2.0  (lhd1 550) 2.2  1.6  1.8  1.4  2.1  1.8  1.4  1.8  1.4  1.9  1.5  1.6  2.1  1.8  1.6  1.6  2.4  2.2  2.0  2.4  2.0  2.7  2.7  2.3  2.3  1.7  2.2  2.7  2.2  2.5  2.1  1.5 9 10-14 8.9 9 10-16 3.3 9 10-15 6.1 9 10-14 1.5 9 10-14 1.3 9 10-14 2.3 9 10-14 6.8 9 10-14 3.4 9 10-16 1.1 9 10-14 1.1 9 10-16 7.9 9 10-14 3.0 9 10-15 7.9 9 10-18 7.2 9 10-16 1.7 9 10-15 1.7 9 10-14 2.1 9 10-14 2.3 9 10-14 2.0 9 10-15  element software feflow is used to model pressuredriven and thermally induced ﬂuid ﬂow including viscosity changes. governing equations for ﬂuid ﬂow and heat transport in saturated porous media are derived from conservation principles of linear momentum, mass, and energy (dhi-wasy 2009). details on the software and the parameterization can be found in diersch (2014).  the model geometry is a 2d vertical sw–ne trending cross section extending 6 km in horizontal and 3 km in vertical direction. the direction of the proﬁle has been selected to cover all relevant processes in the lahendong geothermal ﬁeld: it cuts major faults and the production and injection wells, which are used for temperature and pressure calibration. furthermore, to the groundwater ﬂow direction, showing major ﬂuid ﬂow activities. the homogeneous and isotropic geological layers in the model are stratiﬁed nearly horizontally. faults in the middle of the model, striking perpendicular to the cross section, dip with 84° toward a cooling pluton beneath lake linau. details on structural and geological components of the modeled region have been presented in brehme et al. (2014).  is parallel  it  the numerical  the mesh used for  simulation in feflow consists of 45,264 nodes and 89,320 elements that are denser surrounding the faults because of expected gradients due to parameter contrasts. material properties of  123  elements are permeability, porosity, and thermal conductivity and set according to laboratory measurements (table 1). however, properties of the faults and lake linau are slightly adapted to speciﬁc conditions. the definitions for the modeled grids along the faults are as follows: porosity is 30 % and thermal conductivity is 1.8 w m-1 k-1. corresponding grids for lake linau are deﬁned by a porosity of 100 % and a thermal conductivity of 0.6 w m-1 k-1. the model simulates ﬂuid ﬂow and thermal transport in saturated media in steady state.  initial values and boundary conditions  fluid ﬂow boundary conditions in the model describe groundwater heads and recharge amounts (table 2; fig. 2). the hydraulic head at the sw model boundary is 837 m and 500 m at the ne boundary. the sw hydraulic head represents inﬁltration of surface water into a fault, striking perpendicular to the model. hydraulic head at the ne border is adapted to borehole measurements in that area (brehme et al. 2014). inﬁltration into the fault zones at lake linau is described by ﬂuid ﬂux boundary conditions. the quantity is 3.0 9 10-4 m s-1 the sw and 1.3 9 10-6 m s-1 at the ne fault distributed over 40 m fault width. groundwater recharge is set to 412 mm a-1 at the ne top surface (table 2; fig. 2). fluid movement in  for  \\x0cthe model domain is constrained by no-ﬂow boundary at the bottom, recharge through the surrounding fault zones, and the low hydraulic heads in the ne model area. discharge of the system in the central study area is mainly toward lake linau and across the ne model boundary. initial hydraulic head for the whole model domain is 500 m.  the heat  is 116 °c km-1 at  transport boundary conditions are time-invariant, ﬁxed temperatures, and heat ﬂux (table 2; fig. 2). thermal gradient the sw model boundary, and the temperature is constant 350 °c at the pluton. temperature of water inﬁltrating into faults and here mixing with shallow warm groundwater is 70 °c, while surface groundwater recharge is at 28 °c. temperature values are obtained from ﬁeld and bore log measurements (brehme et al. 2014). heat ﬂux is set to 100 mw m-2 at the bottom model boundary (table 2; fig. 2). this value is ﬁxed based on the studies from delisle et al. (1998), nagao and uyeda (1995), and neben et al. (1998). initial temperature for the model domain is set as 116 °c km-1, according to the local thermal gradient.  permeability determination  initial values for permeability are deﬁned based on laboratory measurements (table 1). after each simulation run, modeled and measured temperature and pressure values have been compared at indicated observation points. in case of poor matching (errors [10 %), permeability has been adjusted until satisfactory results have been achieved. beneath lake linau, simulation results showed locally strong discrepancies between modeled and measured pressure and temperature (errors [45 %). adjustment of permeability in geological inﬁltration rates into faults, or hydraulic heads did not lead to acceptable results. only the implementation of strong permeability anisotropy throughout whole depth, i.e., an additional fault, resulted in minimization of errors (0–7 %). implementation has been accomplished by mesh adaptation to ensure appropriate behavior around the fault. by this procedure, permeability anisotropies have been located and characterized in detail throughout the model.  layers,  in general, deﬁning a direction-dependent permeability improves the data ﬁt rather than using similar permeabilities in all directions. this is probably due to the fractures increasing the permeability mostly in vertical direction.  porosity and thermal conductivity remained constant throughout simulation. variation in porosity is negligible because it would directly be reﬂected in permeability, while thermal conductivity differences would only affect conductive heat transport, which is not dominant in the lahendong area (ondrak et al. 1998; brehme et al. 2014).  123  100c  measurementa  500borelog  ofmodel bottom  boundary

performed to obtain the best ﬁt to the measured data changing the absolute and relative permeability in geological elements. relative permeability refers to different permeabilities in horizontal and vertical direction. as a main result, a blind fault has been recognized beneath lake linau, which has not been known from former studies. simulated pressure and temperature are measured at ﬁve selected observation points, which represent boreholes with available bore logs for pressure and temperature. details on data are given in fig. 6. the model with best data ﬁt, out of 370 different models, is considered to generate the ﬁnal model developed for lahendong.  permeability distribution and identiﬁcation of a blind fault  distribution of permeability patterns in the reservoir has been conceived comparing temperature and pressure data in several wells. especially beneath lake linau, closely located wells show high variations in temperature and pressure. a drop of 100 °c and 18 bar along 300 m distance has been observed between well lhd 24 and lhd 28. models ﬁrst showed high discrepancies between modeled and measured values in this area. however, after implementing another high anisotropic permeable structure between the observation points, models resulted in satisfactory results. the structure has ten times higher vertical  environ earth sci (2016) 75:1088  permeability than horizontal permeability. this structure is assumed to be another fault zone located between two known faults with vertical dip and nw strike. this fault shows no trace at surface, because it is covered by lake linau.  generally, modeled permeability distribution in the lahendong reservoir is direction-dependent and overprints the lithology. modeled permeability is generally higher than measured ones in the order of up to four magnitudes. this is due to fracture patterns, which are not detectable at core-sample scale. permeability patterns directly affect subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow and temperature and pressure distribution.  permeability in the faulted zones and surroundings is lowest in the study area. especially the middle and ne fault, the shallow area beneath sw lake linau and the deep ne section of the ne fault show low permeabilities between 10-13 and 10-14 m2 (fig. 3). the area between the middle and ne fault, the deep section ne of the sw fault, the sw fault itself and the whole model area toward the sw and ne boundary show higher permeabilities of 10-10 and 10-12 m2 (fig. 3).  permeability varies not only within the modeled area, but also in vertical and horizontal direction. in faults and the deep reservoir section in the ne, permeability is by a factor of 10 higher in the vertical direction than in the horizontal direction (fig. 3). in the areas between faults, permeability is in some parts by a factor of 10–100 lower in the vertical direction. in the rest of the model, vertical and horizontal permeability do not differ (fig. 3).  fig. 3 final

suggests that convective heat transport is the dominating process in the reservoir rocks. isotherms generally follow the sw–ne oriented ﬂow pattern, the rise and the inﬁltration of ﬂuids. upwelling of isotherms between the faults veriﬁes water rise toward lake linau. inﬁltration of cold water causes down welling of isotherms particularly on the northeast section of the model. temperature is locally increased at the bottom of the model surrounding the pluton (fig. 4).  subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow  the absolute and horizontal/vertical permeability distribution controls local ﬂuid ﬂow in the lahendong reservoir.  the general ﬂuid ﬂow, driven by the natural pressure gradient, is oriented from sw to ne. vertical inﬁltration occurs at faults at lake linau and at the sw boundary. discharge is across the ne model boundary (fig. 5). the more detailed ﬂow patterns can be observed with streamlines, which show a ﬂuid ﬂow along highly permeable areas. calculated streamlines describe particle ﬂow within the model domain. a forward calculation shows how inﬁltrating water at the sw model boundary distributes through the reservoir. the backward calculation shows the source of ﬂuid particles arriving at the ne model boundary (fig. 5). patterns show that hot groundwater ﬂows toward the faults beneath lake linau, where the ﬂuid ﬂow is disturbed by a rise in temperature and vertically high permeable layers. this causes a rise of groundwater in this model area (red forward streamlines in fig. 5). at the same time, cold water inﬁltrates into high permeable areas and distributes over the ne model domain (blue backward streamlines in fig. 5). it is clearly seen that the composition of the ne reservoir domain is dominated by coldwater inﬁltration into faults, while the production areas are characterized by hot water ﬂow (fig. 5).  discussion  investigation of subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow in geothermal reservoirs is crucial for sustainable exploitation avoiding drilling into less productive areas. subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow might be locally inﬂuenced by fault zones or physical  123  \\x0c1088 page 8 of 11  environ earth sci (2016) 75:1088  fig. 5 model domain with calculated streamlines, in

water (i.e. viscosity). the inﬂuence of these parameters on the ﬂuid ﬂow has been investigated in lahendong geothermal reservoir using hydraulic–thermal simulations. simulation results show the detailed permeability distribution in the reservoir including location of an additional fault zone.  matching of measured and simulated temperature and pressure has been used as a tool for resolving the permeability distribution. temperature and pressure have been iteratively determined at several observation points (fig. 2). generally, modeled values are in good agreement with observed ones (fig. 6). nevertheless, some observation points give slightly different values for both pressure and temperature (lhd 4 and lhd 7) or only temperature (lhd 24). this is probably due to the complicated ﬂow processes or strong small-scale structural variation in fractured and faulted areas. furthermore, density variations, which could have not been included into simulation due to high temperatures, could cause variation of ﬂuid pressure. however, the average deviation of simulated pressure and temperature is 1 %.  implemented model parameters are porosity, permeability, and heat conductivity. from those parameters, only permeability has been tested in a speciﬁc range during simulation. the inﬂuence of porosity and heat conductivity on ﬂuid ﬂow is negligible due to dominating convective heat ﬂow (ondrak et al. 1998). values implemented in the model are based on measured permeabilities, which represent matrix permeability of rocks.  the measured matrix permeability, representing permeability in horizontal direction, is 1.5 9 10-14 m2 on  123  average, which remains within typical permeability range for fractured igneous rocks (schoen 2004). permeability for volcanic breccias ranges typically between 3 9 10-15 and 5 9 10-12 m2 and tuff permeabilities range between 7 9 10-17 and 7 9 10-12 m2 (klavetter and peters 1987). in the wairakei geothermal ﬁeld, simulating the impermeable layers resulted in permeabilities of 10-18 and 10-14 m2, in horizontal and vertical axis, respectively (mercer and faust 1979).  however, permeability in reservoir rocks might be locally increased due to fracture formation. it might also be decreased due to alteration and sealing in faults. in lahendong, modeled permeability can be up to four magnitudes higher than measured ones in faulted areas. this is caused by fractures, which are not detectable in core scale. moreover, in fault cores, it is by a factor of 10 higher in vertical direction than in horizontal direction. however, in areas between faults (fault gauge), permeability is in some parts by a factor of 10–100 lower in the vertical direction. adaptation of permeability ensures a ﬁt to measured temperature and pressure data.  permeability in fractured areas is the main factor inﬂuencing subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow and temperature distribution in the lahendong reservoir area. subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow is driven by local hydraulic heads, which show high variations at different sections of the study area. consequently, convective heat distribution leads to high temperature variation along the reservoir. these phenomena are observed in lahendong as well as comparable ﬁelds. in new mexico, water level drops of 30–100 m are observed across (haneberg 1995). high  several  fault  zones  \\x0c123  environ earth sci (2016)

(2014)  temperature drops and upwelling of isotherms indicate that fault zones control the ﬂuid ﬂow in the lake long and valentine ﬁelds, usa (hooper 1991). the analysis of ﬂuid pressure differences at the alpine fault, new zealand, allowed to characterize the change in permeability between hanging and footwall blocks (sutherland et al. 2012).  in summary, high pressure or temperature gradients are indicators for ﬂuid barriers between observation points. in other words, reservoir sections of different properties are separated by horizontally less permeable faults. in lahendong, most signiﬁcant ﬂuid barriers are faults to the sw and to the ne of lake linau. across these barriers, the pressure drops up to 20 bars. a similar pattern has been measured in bore logs beneath lake linau, where no surface trace of a fault had been observed in former studies. however, only by implementing another fault, modeled and measured values could have been adapted. the recently identiﬁed fault zone beneath lake linau remains under lake water and therefore is only traceable by this kind of reservoir modeling.  additionally to fault identiﬁcation, the internal structure of known fault zones has been understood in detail. the ne fault, i.e., shows a displacement at 2 km depth. the detailed trend has been understood by permeability adaptation in this area.  due to low permeability in horizontal direction in the faults, ﬂuids propagate mostly vertically toward the hot springs at surface. it also allows surface water to inﬁltrate into the reservoir in case the pressure within the fault zone is low enough (fig. 5). this vertical ﬂuid movement  eventually controls the temperature distribution in the reservoir. upward migration of deep hot water increases the temperature, while inﬁltration of cold surface water causes local drop of temperature.  in summary, the most important factors inﬂuencing the reliability of numerical reservoir models are absolute and different horizontal and vertical permeability. however, a permeability adaptation has been done for each geological layer; the vertical permeability anomalies are overprinting those layers and are constraining the regional groundwater ﬂow. those permeabilities of fractures directly inﬂuence the productivity of the reservoir (cherubini et al. 2013). therefore, their permeability characteristics should be investigated in detail.  in a previous study, a numerical model for the lahendong site has been set up in tough2 and aimed at forecasting the reservoir behavior during exploitation until the year 2036. with a production of 60 mwe, it predicts a pressure drop of 10 bars. however, the forecast results are uncertain due to lack of measured pressure draw down data (yani 2006). accordingly, the next steps of the presented study should include a realistic production and injection scenario in order reservoir exploitation. furthermore, chemical characteristics could be considered to achieve reliable production setups, because hydrochemical processes play an important role in the lahendong reservoir (brehme et al. 2016). presented models from this study provide important information on ﬂuid ﬂow in the water-dominated lahendong reservoir. however, additional the  two-phase ﬂow models of  to support  sustainable  \\x0c1088 page 10 of 11  environ earth sci (2016) 75:1088  lahendong area are in progress to understand the inﬂuence of steam driven ﬂuid ﬂow in this high-temperature system.  conclusion  the primary focus of this study is to understand the inﬂuence of fault zones and permeability patterns on subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow in geothermal reservoirs. the ﬂuid ﬂow mainly depends on rock and fault zone permeability. these processes have been considered in numerical models, which simulate local temperature and pressure conditions. the initial reservoir conditions, which refers to the case before production starts. models are developed based on the conceptual models of the

pressure signiﬁcantly drop across that ﬂuid barrier. this behavior has been observed in comparable ﬁelds in the usa as well. the overall shape of ﬂuid ﬂow direction trends in a sw–ne direction. main recharge occurs by inﬁltration of surface water into the faults, especially in the southwest and near to lake linau. discharge is enhanced in highly fractured areas toward lake linau. vertical permeability of faults allows ﬂuids rising toward the hot springs at surface.  results show that permeability has to be considered for simulation of a geothermal system. the geothermal system is mainly controlled by ﬂuid ﬂow in fractures/faults depending on temperature and pressure conditions. the locally modiﬁed ﬂuid ﬂow can considerably inﬂuence the productivity of a geothermal ﬁeld. results also guide reservoir management in case of a potential for ﬁeld extension, as performed in lahendong.  acknowledgments the authors acknowledge the continuous support within the team of the

subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow of reservoirs in active tectonic regions is mainly controlled by permeability of fault zones. therefore, the characterization of fault zones is an important step toward performance

of existing systems to satisfy continuously growing demand. the productivity of a geothermal ﬁeld mainly depends on subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow, which in active tectonic regions is controlled by permeability of fault zones moeck . in that frame, the primary focus is on locating and characterizing faulted areas in geothermal ﬁelds. this study employs numerical modeling to allocate and quantify permeability anisotropies and discontinuities, e.g., faults, in order to understand their inﬂuence on subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow in geothermal reservoirs.  numerical models have been increasingly used to understand the setup and productivity of geothermal systems. a general overview of geothermal models has been given by osullivan et al. . additionally, there are several sites exemplifying similar characteristics as in lahendong. the underground movement of hot and cold ﬂuids has been modeled for geothermal ﬁelds in new zealand kaya et al. . the kakkonda geothermal site, e.g., consists of two reservoirs at various depths with different ﬂuid properties. there, results from ﬂuid ﬂow analysis show the importance of fractures for ﬂuid transport enhancing the recharge or discharge in the reservoir    \\x0c

models for the seferihisarbalc¸ova ﬁeld focus on the ﬂuid ﬂow inside of faults. results show an enhanced upward heat transport through ﬂuids from bottom of the geothermal system magri et al. .  our test ground is the lahendong geothermal ﬁeld located in sulawesi, indonesia. the ﬁeld is owned and operated by p.t. pertamina geothermal energy and hosts a power plant with a production capacity of  mwe. there, geothermal exploration started in the early s including geophysical and geohydrochemical approaches. it is a waterdominated magmatic structurally controlled system. faults generally act as acrossfault ﬂuid barriers and alongfault ﬂuid conductors brehme et al. . as a result, hot springs mainly appear on the top of vertically permeable faults at the surface. available numerous drilling and surface measurements allowed a detailed characterization of the geological and hydrogeological setting of the area fig.  brehme et al. , , ,  wiegand et al. . the model presented here is developed for investigating subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow and the permeability distribution including the fault zones in the lahendong geothermal ﬁeld. below, the geological structure of the  ﬁeld is presented followed by an introduction to the modeling approach.  detailed investigation of subsurface permeability distribution is a crucial step for site selection and smart drilling strategies. the numerical simulations presented will provide insight into understanding the subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow considering the hydraulic conductivity of faults. it ensures productive as well as sustainable operation of geothermal ﬁelds avoiding risks, such as drilling into nonfractured or cold zones, and targeting highly corroding waters. although the target area is lahendong, the general workﬂow is applicable for other geothermal sites consisting of similar constraints.  reservoir characterization  hydrogeology  the overall driving force for the ﬂuid ﬂow is the swne oriented natural hydraulic gradient in the lahendong geothermal system. the direction of ﬂuid ﬂow varies through the geothermal site due to horizontal partitioning of the reservoir by relatively less permeable fault zones brehme et al. . the

however, faults are rather permeable along the vertical axis, which allows recharge of the system through the faults. rainwater inﬁltrates at a fault in the sw, at mt. lengkoan, and creek water

achieved. beneath lake linau, simulation results showed locally strong discrepancies between modeled and measured pressure and temperature errors  . adjustment of permeability in geological inﬁltration rates into faults, or hydraulic heads did not lead to acceptable results. only the implementation of strong permeability anisotropy throughout whole depth, i.e., an additional fault, resulted in minimization of errors  . implementation has been accomplished by mesh adaptation to ensure appropriate behavior around the fault. by this procedure, permeability anisotropies have been located and characterized in detail throughout the model.  layers,  in general, deﬁning a directiondependent permeability improves the data ﬁt rather than using similar permeabilities in all directions. this is probably due to the fractures increasing the permeability mostly in vertical direction.  porosity and thermal conductivity remained constant throughout simulation. variation in porosity is negligible because it would directly be reﬂected in permeability, while thermal conductivity differences would only affect conductive heat transport, which is not dominant in the lahendong

ﬁt to the measured data changing the absolute and relative permeability in geological elements. relative permeability refers to different permeabilities in horizontal and vertical direction. as a main result, a blind fault has been recognized beneath lake linau, which has not been known from former studies. simulated pressure and temperature are measured at ﬁve selected observation points, which represent boreholes with available bore logs for pressure and temperature. details on data are given in fig. . the model with best data ﬁt, out of  different models, is considered to generate the ﬁnal model developed for lahendong.  permeability distribution and identiﬁcation of a blind fault  distribution of permeability patterns in the reservoir has been conceived comparing temperature and pressure data in several wells. especially beneath lake linau, closely located wells show high variations in temperature and pressure. a drop of  °c and  bar along  m distance has been observed between well lhd  and lhd . models ﬁrst showed high discrepancies between modeled and measured values in this area. however, after implementing another high anisotropic permeable structure between the observation points, models resulted in satisfactory results. the structure has ten times higher vertical  environ earth sci    permeability than horizontal permeability. this structure is assumed to be another fault zone located between two known faults with vertical dip and nw strike. this fault shows no trace at surface, because it is covered by lake linau.  generally, modeled permeability distribution in the lahendong reservoir is directiondependent and overprints the lithology. modeled permeability is generally higher than measured ones in the order of up to four magnitudes. this is due to fracture patterns, which are not detectable at coresample scale. permeability patterns directly affect subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow and temperature and pressure distribution.  permeability in the faulted zones and surroundings is lowest in the study area. especially the middle and ne fault, the shallow area beneath sw lake linau and the deep ne section of the ne fault show low permeabilities between  and  m fig. . the area between the middle and ne fault, the deep section ne of the sw fault, the sw fault itself and the whole model area toward the sw and ne boundary show higher

is by a factor of  higher in the vertical direction than in the horizontal direction fig. . in the areas between faults, permeability is in some parts by a factor of  lower in the vertical direction.

overpressure releases through high permeable zones beneath lake linau and discharges toward surface. the pressure drop is up to  bars across the faults fig. .  temperature distribution  temperature distribution along the lahendong geothermal reservoir suggests that convective heat transport is the dominating process in the reservoir rocks. isotherms generally follow the swne oriented ﬂow pattern, the rise and the inﬁltration of ﬂuids. upwelling of isotherms between the faults veriﬁes water rise toward lake linau. inﬁltration of cold water causes down welling of isotherms particularly on the northeast section of the model. temperature is locally increased at the bottom of the model surrounding the pluton fig. .  subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow  the absolute and horizontalvertical permeability distribution controls local ﬂuid ﬂow in the lahendong reservoir.  the general ﬂuid ﬂow, driven by the natural pressure gradient, is oriented from sw to ne. vertical inﬁltration occurs at faults at lake linau and at the sw boundary. discharge is across the ne model boundary fig. . the more detailed ﬂow patterns can be observed with streamlines, which show a ﬂuid ﬂow along highly permeable areas. calculated streamlines describe particle ﬂow within the model domain. a forward calculation shows how inﬁltrating water at the sw model boundary distributes through the reservoir. the backward calculation shows the source of ﬂuid particles arriving at the ne model boundary fig. . patterns show that hot groundwater ﬂows toward the faults beneath lake linau, where the ﬂuid ﬂow is disturbed by a rise in temperature and vertically high permeable layers. this causes a rise of groundwater in this model area red forward streamlines in fig. . at the same time, cold water inﬁltrates into high

properties of water i.e. viscosity. the inﬂuence of these parameters on the ﬂuid ﬂow has been investigated in lahendong geothermal reservoir using hydraulicthermal simulations. simulation results show the detailed permeability distribution in the reservoir including location of an additional fault zone.  matching of measured and simulated temperature and pressure has been used as a tool for resolving the permeability distribution. temperature and pressure have been iteratively determined at several observation points fig. . generally, modeled values are in good agreement with observed ones fig. . nevertheless, some observation points give slightly different values for both pressure and temperature lhd  and lhd  or only temperature lhd . this is probably due to the complicated ﬂow processes or strong smallscale structural variation in fractured and faulted areas. furthermore, density variations, which could have not been included into simulation due to high temperatures, could cause variation of ﬂuid pressure. however, the average deviation of simulated pressure and temperature is  .  implemented model parameters are porosity, permeability, and heat conductivity. from those parameters, only permeability has been tested in a speciﬁc range during simulation. the inﬂuence of porosity and heat conductivity on ﬂuid ﬂow is negligible due to dominating convective heat ﬂow ondrak et al. . values implemented in the model are based on measured permeabilities, which represent matrix permeability of rocks.  the measured matrix permeability, representing permeability in horizontal direction, is .   m on    average, which remains within typical permeability range for fractured igneous rocks schoen . permeability for volcanic breccias ranges typically between    and    m and tuff permeabilities range between    and    m klavetter and peters . in the wairakei geothermal ﬁeld, simulating the impermeable layers resulted in permeabilities of  and  m, in horizontal and vertical axis, respectively mercer and faust .  however, permeability in reservoir rocks might be locally increased due to fracture formation. it might also be decreased due to alteration and sealing in faults. in lahendong, modeled permeability can be up to four magnitudes higher than measured ones in faulted areas. this is caused by fractures, which are not detectable in core scale. moreover, in fault cores, it is by a factor of  higher in vertical direction than in horizontal direction. however, in areas between faults fault gauge, permeability is in some parts by a factor of  lower in the vertical direction. adaptation of permeability ensures a ﬁt to measured temperature and pressure data.  permeability in fractured areas is the main factor inﬂuencing subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow and temperature distribution in the lahendong reservoir area. subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow is driven by local hydraulic heads, which show high variations at different sections of the study area. consequently, convective heat distribution leads to high temperature variation along the reservoir. these phenomena are observed in lahendong as well as comparable ﬁelds. in new mexico, water level drops of  m are

temperature and pressure at selected observation points. well speciﬁcations and measured data from brehme et al.   temperature drops and upwelling of isotherms indicate that fault zones control the ﬂuid ﬂow in the lake long and valentine ﬁelds, usa hooper . the analysis of ﬂuid pressure differences at the alpine fault, new zealand, allowed to characterize the change in permeability between hanging and footwall blocks sutherland et al. .  in summary, high pressure or temperature gradients are indicators for ﬂuid barriers between observation points. in other words, reservoir sections of different properties are separated by horizontally less permeable faults. in lahendong, most signiﬁcant ﬂuid barriers are faults to the sw and to the ne of lake linau. across these barriers, the pressure drops up to  bars. a similar pattern has been measured in bore logs beneath lake linau, where no surface trace of a fault had been observed in former studies. however, only by implementing another fault, modeled and measured values could have been adapted. the recently identiﬁed fault zone beneath lake linau remains under lake water and therefore is only traceable by this kind of reservoir modeling.  additionally to fault identiﬁcation, the internal structure of known fault zones has been understood in detail. the ne fault, i.e., shows a displacement at  km depth. the detailed trend has been understood by permeability adaptation in this area.  due to low permeability in horizontal direction in the faults, ﬂuids propagate mostly vertically toward the hot springs at surface. it also allows surface water to inﬁltrate into the reservoir in case the pressure within the fault zone is low enough fig. . this vertical ﬂuid movement  eventually controls the temperature distribution in the reservoir. upward migration of deep hot water increases the temperature, while inﬁltration of cold surface water causes local drop of temperature.  in summary, the most important factors inﬂuencing the reliability of numerical reservoir models are absolute and different horizontal and vertical permeability. however, a permeability adaptation has been done for each geological layer the vertical permeability anomalies are overprinting those layers and are constraining the regional groundwater ﬂow. those permeabilities of fractures directly inﬂuence the productivity of the reservoir cherubini et al. . therefore, their permeability characteristics should be investigated in detail.  in a previous study, a numerical model for the lahendong site has been set up in tough and aimed at forecasting the reservoir behavior during exploitation until the year . with a production of  mwe, it predicts a pressure drop of  bars. however, the forecast results are uncertain due to lack of measured pressure draw down data yani . accordingly, the next steps of the presented study should include a realistic production and injection scenario in order reservoir exploitation. furthermore, chemical characteristics could be considered to achieve reliable production setups, because hydrochemical processes play an important role in the lahendong reservoir brehme et al. . presented models from this study provide important information on ﬂuid ﬂow in the waterdominated lahendong reservoir. however, additional the  twophase ﬂow models of  to support  sustainable  \\x0c

understand the inﬂuence of fault zones and permeability patterns on subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow in geothermal reservoirs. the ﬂuid ﬂow mainly depends on rock and fault zone permeability. these processes have been considered in numerical models, which simulate local temperature and pressure conditions. the initial reservoir conditions, which refers to the case before production starts. models are developed based on the conceptual models of the study area, which explain reservoir geometry, geological structures, temperature, and hydraulic conditions. temperature and pressure welllogs have been used for model calibration.  the numerical models represent  vertical and horizontal ﬂuid ﬂow is mainly controlled by fault permeability. this characteristic is used to simulate different reservoir sections, and vertical ﬂuid rise toward the surface. by stepwise adaptation of permeability ﬁelds, based on observed temperature and pressure gradients, an additional blind fault zone can be identiﬁed beneath lake linau. temperature and pressure signiﬁcantly drop across that ﬂuid barrier. this behavior has been observed in comparable ﬁelds in the usa as well. the overall shape of ﬂuid ﬂow direction trends in a swne direction. main recharge occurs by inﬁltration of surface water into the faults, especially in the southwest and near to lake linau. discharge is enhanced in highly fractured areas toward lake linau. vertical permeability of faults allows ﬂuids rising toward the hot springs at surface.  results show that permeability has to be considered for simulation of a geothermal system. the geothermal system is mainly controlled by ﬂuid ﬂow in fracturesfaults depending on temperature and pressure conditions. the locally modiﬁed ﬂuid ﬂow can considerably inﬂuence the productivity of a geothermal ﬁeld. results also guide reservoir management in case of a potential for ﬁeld extension, as performed in lahendong.  acknowledgments the authors acknowledge the continuous support within

in active tectonic regions is mainly controlled by permeability of fault zones. therefore, the characterization of fault zones is an important step toward performance assessment of a reservoir. the

geothermal energy is an essential component to supply future energy demands. requires developing new geothermal sites and improving the performance of existing systems to satisfy continuously growing demand. the productivity of a geothermal ﬁeld mainly depends on subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow, which in active tectonic regions is controlled by permeability of fault zones moeck . in that frame, the primary focus is on locating and characterizing faulted areas in geothermal ﬁelds. this study employs numerical modeling to allocate and quantify permeability anisotropies and discontinuities, e.g., faults, in order to understand their inﬂuence on subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow in geothermal reservoirs. numerical models have been increasingly used to understand the setup and productivity of geothermal systems. a general overview of geothermal models has been given by osullivan et al. . additionally, there are several sites exemplifying similar characteristics as in lahendong. the underground movement of hot and cold ﬂuids has been modeled for geothermal ﬁelds in new zealand kaya et al. . the kakkonda geothermal site, e.g., consists of two reservoirs at various depths with different ﬂuid properties. there, results from ﬂuid ﬂow analysis show the importance of fractures for ﬂuid transport enhancing the recharge or discharge in the reservoir page of environ earth sci mcguinness et al. . generally, faults acting as preferential ﬂuid path ways signiﬁcantly change the pressure and temperature ﬁeld in the reservoir cherubini et al. . models for the seferihisarbalc¸ova ﬁeld focus on the ﬂuid ﬂow

indonesia. the ﬁeld is owned and operated by p.t. pertamina geothermal energy and hosts a power plant with a production capacity of mwe. there, geothermal exploration started in the early s including geophysical and geohydrochemical approaches. it is a waterdominated magmatic structurally controlled system. faults generally act as acrossfault ﬂuid barriers and alongfault ﬂuid conductors brehme et al. . as a result, hot springs mainly appear on the top of vertically permeable faults at the surface. available numerous drilling and surface measurements allowed a detailed characterization of the geological and hydrogeological setting of the area fig. brehme et al. , , , wiegand et al. . the model presented here is developed for investigating subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow and the permeability distribution including the fault zones in the lahendong geothermal ﬁeld. below, the geological structure of the ﬁeld is presented followed by an introduction to the modeling approach. detailed investigation of subsurface permeability distribution is a crucial step for site selection and smart drilling strategies. the numerical simulations presented will provide insight into understanding the subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow considering the hydraulic conductivity of faults. it ensures productive as well as sustainable operation of geothermal ﬁelds avoiding risks, such as drilling into nonfractured or cold zones, and targeting highly corroding waters. although the target area is lahendong, the general workﬂow is applicable for other geothermal sites consisting of similar constraints. reservoir characterization hydrogeology the overall driving force for the ﬂuid ﬂow is the swne oriented natural hydraulic gradient in the lahendong geothermal system. the direction of ﬂuid ﬂow varies through the geothermal site due to horizontal partitioning of the reservoir by relatively less permeable fault zones brehme et al. . the basic sections are located in the fig. topographic map of the study

measurements table . after each simulation run, modeled and measured temperature and pressure values have been compared at indicated observation points. in case of poor matching errors , permeability has been adjusted until satisfactory results have been achieved. beneath lake linau, simulation results showed locally strong discrepancies between modeled and measured pressure and temperature errors . adjustment of permeability in geological inﬁltration rates into faults, or hydraulic heads did not lead to acceptable results. only the implementation of strong permeability anisotropy throughout whole depth, i.e., an additional fault, resulted in minimization of errors . implementation has been accomplished by mesh adaptation to ensure appropriate behavior around the fault. by this procedure, permeability anisotropies have been located and characterized in detail throughout the model. layers, in general, deﬁning a directiondependent permeability improves the data ﬁt rather than using similar permeabilities in all directions. this is probably due to the fractures increasing the permeability mostly in vertical direction. porosity and thermal conductivity remained constant throughout simulation. variation in porosity is negligible because it would directly be reﬂected in permeability, while thermal conductivity differences would only affect conductive heat transport, which is not dominant in the lahendong area ondrak et al. brehme et al. . c measurementa borelog ofmodel bottom boundary nemodel cdelisleetal.,nagaoanduyeda,nebenetal. bdwd,hoeltingandcoldewey,saghravanietal.

recognized beneath lake linau, which has not been known from former studies. simulated pressure and temperature are measured at ﬁve selected observation points, which represent boreholes with available bore logs for pressure and temperature. details on data are given in fig. . the model with best data ﬁt, out of different models, is considered to generate the ﬁnal model developed for lahendong. permeability distribution and identiﬁcation of a blind fault distribution of permeability patterns in the reservoir has been conceived comparing temperature and pressure data in several wells. especially beneath lake linau, closely located wells show high variations in temperature and pressure. a drop of °c and bar along m distance has been observed between well lhd and lhd . models ﬁrst showed high discrepancies between modeled and measured values in this area. however, after implementing another high anisotropic permeable structure between the observation points, models resulted in satisfactory results. the structure has ten times higher vertical environ earth sci permeability than horizontal permeability. this structure is assumed to be another fault zone located between two known faults with vertical dip and nw strike. this fault shows no trace at surface, because it is covered by lake linau. generally, modeled permeability distribution in the lahendong reservoir is directiondependent and overprints the lithology. modeled permeability is generally higher than measured ones in the order of up to four magnitudes. this is due to fracture patterns, which are not detectable at coresample scale. permeability patterns directly affect subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow and temperature and pressure distribution. permeability in the faulted zones and surroundings is lowest in the study area. especially the middle and ne fault, the shallow area beneath sw lake linau and the deep ne section of the ne fault show low permeabilities between and m fig. . the area

that convective heat transport is the dominating process in the reservoir rocks. isotherms generally follow the swne oriented ﬂow pattern, the rise and the inﬁltration of ﬂuids. upwelling of isotherms between the faults veriﬁes water rise toward lake linau. inﬁltration of cold water causes down welling of isotherms particularly on the northeast section of the model. temperature is locally increased

general ﬂuid ﬂow, driven by the natural pressure gradient, is oriented from sw to ne. vertical inﬁltration occurs at faults at lake linau and at the sw boundary. discharge is across the ne model boundary fig. . the more detailed ﬂow patterns can be observed with streamlines, which show a ﬂuid ﬂow along highly permeable areas. calculated streamlines describe particle ﬂow within the model domain. a forward calculation shows how inﬁltrating water at the sw model boundary distributes through the reservoir. the backward calculation shows the source of ﬂuid particles arriving at the ne model boundary fig. . patterns show that hot groundwater ﬂows toward the faults beneath lake linau, where the ﬂuid ﬂow is disturbed by a rise in temperature and vertically high permeable layers. this

ﬂow has been investigated in lahendong geothermal reservoir using hydraulicthermal simulations. simulation results show the detailed permeability distribution in the reservoir including location of an additional fault zone. matching of measured and simulated temperature and pressure has been used as a tool for resolving the permeability distribution. temperature and pressure have been iteratively determined at several observation points fig. . generally, modeled values are in good agreement with observed ones fig. . nevertheless, some observation points give slightly different values for both pressure and temperature lhd and lhd or only temperature lhd . this is probably due to the complicated ﬂow processes or strong smallscale structural variation in fractured and faulted areas. furthermore, density variations, which could have not been included into simulation due to high temperatures, could cause variation of ﬂuid pressure. however, the average deviation of simulated pressure and temperature is . implemented model parameters are porosity, permeability, and heat conductivity. from those parameters, only permeability has been tested in a speciﬁc range during simulation. the inﬂuence of porosity and heat conductivity on ﬂuid ﬂow is negligible due to dominating convective heat ﬂow ondrak et al. . values implemented in the model are based on measured

wairakei geothermal ﬁeld, simulating the impermeable layers resulted in permeabilities of and m, in horizontal and vertical axis, respectively mercer and faust . however, permeability in reservoir rocks might be locally increased due to fracture formation. it might also be decreased due to alteration and sealing in faults. in lahendong, modeled permeability can be up to four magnitudes higher than measured ones in faulted areas. this is caused by fractures, which are not detectable in core scale. moreover, in fault cores, it is by a factor of higher in vertical direction than in horizontal direction. however, in areas between faults fault gauge, permeability is in some parts by a factor of lower in the vertical direction. adaptation of permeability ensures a ﬁt to measured temperature and pressure data. permeability in fractured areas is the main factor inﬂuencing subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow and temperature distribution in the lahendong reservoir area. subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow is driven by local hydraulic heads, which show high variations at different sections of the study area. consequently, convective heat distribution leads to high temperature variation along the reservoir. these phenomena are observed in lahendong as well as comparable ﬁelds. in new mexico, water level drops of m are observed across haneberg . high several fault zones environ earth sci page of well name lhd

at the alpine fault, new zealand, allowed to characterize the change in permeability between hanging and footwall blocks sutherland et al. . in summary, high pressure or temperature gradients are indicators for ﬂuid barriers between observation points. in other words, reservoir sections of different properties are separated by horizontally less permeable faults. in lahendong, most signiﬁcant ﬂuid barriers are faults to the sw and to the ne of lake linau. across these barriers, the pressure drops up to bars. a similar pattern has been measured in bore logs beneath lake linau, where no surface trace of a fault had been observed in former studies. however, only by implementing another fault, modeled and measured values could have been adapted. the recently identiﬁed fault zone beneath lake linau remains under lake water and therefore is only traceable by this kind of reservoir modeling. additionally to fault identiﬁcation, the internal structure of known fault zones has been understood in detail. the ne fault, i.e., shows a displacement at km depth. the detailed trend has been understood by permeability adaptation in this area. due to low permeability in horizontal direction in the faults, ﬂuids propagate mostly vertically toward the hot springs at surface. it also allows surface water to inﬁltrate into the reservoir in case the pressure within the fault zone is low enough fig. . this vertical ﬂuid movement eventually controls the temperature distribution in the reservoir. upward migration of deep hot water increases the temperature, while inﬁltration of cold surface water causes local drop of temperature. in summary, the most important factors inﬂuencing the reliability of numerical reservoir models are absolute and different horizontal and vertical permeability. however, a permeability adaptation has been done for each geological layer the vertical permeability anomalies are overprinting those layers and are constraining the regional groundwater ﬂow. those permeabilities of fractures directly inﬂuence the productivity of the reservoir cherubini et al. . therefore, their permeability characteristics should be investigated in detail. in a previous study, a numerical model for the lahendong site has been set up in tough and aimed at forecasting the reservoir behavior during exploitation until the year . with a production of mwe, it predicts a pressure drop of bars. however, the forecast results are uncertain due to lack of measured pressure draw down data yani . accordingly, the next steps of the presented study should include a realistic production and injection scenario in order reservoir exploitation. furthermore, chemical characteristics could be considered to achieve reliable production setups, because hydrochemical processes play an important role in the lahendong reservoir brehme et al. . presented models from this study provide important information on ﬂuid ﬂow in the waterdominated lahendong reservoir. however, additional the twophase ﬂow models of to support sustainable page of environ earth sci lahendong area are in progress to understand the inﬂuence of steam driven ﬂuid ﬂow in this hightemperature system. conclusion the primary focus of this study is to understand the inﬂuence of fault zones and permeability patterns on subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow in geothermal reservoirs. the ﬂuid ﬂow mainly depends on rock and fault zone permeability. these processes have been considered in numerical models, which simulate local temperature and pressure conditions. the initial reservoir conditions, which refers to the case before production starts. models are developed based on the conceptual models of the study area, which explain reservoir geometry, geological structures, temperature, and hydraulic conditions. temperature and pressure welllogs have been used for model calibration. the numerical models represent vertical and horizontal ﬂuid ﬂow is mainly controlled by fault permeability. this characteristic is used to simulate different reservoir sections, and vertical ﬂuid rise toward the surface. by stepwise adaptation of permeability ﬁelds, based on observed temperature and pressure gradients, an additional blind fault zone can be identiﬁed beneath lake linau. temperature and pressure signiﬁcantly drop across that ﬂuid barrier. this behavior has been observed in comparable ﬁelds in the usa as well. the overall shape of ﬂuid ﬂow direction trends in a swne direction. main recharge occurs by inﬁltration of surface water into the faults, especially in the southwest and near to lake linau. discharge is enhanced in highly fractured areas toward lake linau. vertical permeability of faults allows ﬂuids rising toward the hot springs at surface. results show that permeability has to be considered for simulation of a geothermal system. the geothermal system is mainly controlled by ﬂuid ﬂow in fracturesfaults depending on temperature and pressure conditions. the locally modiﬁed ﬂuid ﬂow can considerably inﬂuence the productivity of a geothermal ﬁeld. results also guide reservoir management in case of a potential for ﬁeld extension, as performed in lahendong. acknowledgments the authors acknowledge the continuous support within the team of the international center for geothermal research under the direction of e. huenges. thanks to

july 2016 ó springer-verlag berlin heidelberg 2016 abstract subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow of reservoirs in active tectonic regions is mainly controlled by permeability of fault zones. therefore, the characterization of fault zones is an important step toward performance assessment of a reservoir. the ﬂuid ﬂow is controlled also by pressure and temperature conditions. in this context, we simulated pressure and temperature ﬁelds to elaborate on the inﬂuence of permeability on subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow in the lahendong geothermal reservoir. thermal–hydraulic simulation is performed using a ﬁnite element approach. adjusting the permeability through 370 different cases, modeling results converged to the observed data within a misﬁt range of 0–7 %. the best ﬁtting models identiﬁed a deep-seated fault that has previously not been traced at the surface. simulated temperature distribution suggests a prominent convective heat ﬂow, driven by an upward migrating and sw–ne oriented ﬂuid ﬂow. this hydraulic gradient causes a pressure drop along the reservoir. highpressure patterns are used to constrain recharge areas, in addition to inﬁltration measurements. discharge ﬂow occurs from sw to ne migrating also upward toward the hot springs. in that frame, thermal–hydraulic simulations identiﬁed previously unresolved subsurface faults, which & maren brehme brehme@gfz-potsdam.de 1 helmholtz

faults \\x01 hydrogeology \\x01 fluid ﬂow \\x01 geothermal ﬁeld management \\x01 reservoir engineering \\x01 pressure drop introduction it geothermal energy is an essential component to supply future energy demands. requires developing new geothermal sites and improving the performance of existing systems to satisfy continuously growing demand. the productivity of a geothermal ﬁeld mainly depends on subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow, which in active tectonic regions is controlled by permeability of fault zones (moeck 2014). in that frame, the primary focus is on locating and characterizing faulted areas in geothermal ﬁelds. this study employs numerical modeling to allocate and quantify permeability anisotropies and discontinuities, e.g., faults, in order to understand their inﬂuence on subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow in geothermal reservoirs. numerical models have been increasingly used to understand the setup and productivity of geothermal systems. a general overview of geothermal models has been given by o’sullivan et al (2001). additionally, there are several sites exemplifying similar characteristics as in lahendong. the underground movement of hot and cold ﬂuids has been modeled for geothermal ﬁelds in new zealand (kaya et al 2014). the kakkonda geothermal site, e.g., consists of two reservoirs at various depths with different ﬂuid properties. there, results from ﬂuid ﬂow analysis show the importance of fractures for ﬂuid transport enhancing the recharge or discharge in the reservoir 123\\x0c1088 page 2 of 11 environ earth sci (2016) 75:1088 (mcguinness et al 1995). generally, faults acting as preferential ﬂuid path ways signiﬁcantly change the pressure and temperature ﬁeld in the reservoir (cherubini et al 2013). models for the seferihisar–balc¸ova ﬁeld focus on the ﬂuid ﬂow inside of faults. results show an enhanced upward heat transport through ﬂuids from bottom of the geothermal system (magri et al 2011). our test ground is the lahendong geothermal ﬁeld located in sulawesi, indonesia. the ﬁeld is owned and operated by p.t. pertamina geothermal energy and hosts a power plant with a production capacity of 80 mwe. there, geothermal exploration started in the early 1970s including geophysical and geohydrochemical approaches. it is a water-dominated magmatic structurally controlled system. faults generally act as across-fault ﬂuid barriers and alongfault ﬂuid conductors (brehme et al 2014). as a result, hot springs mainly appear on the top of vertically permeable faults at the surface. available numerous drilling and surface measurements allowed a detailed characterization of the geological and hydrogeological setting of the area (fig. 1; brehme et al 2011, 2013, 2014, 2016; wiegand et al 2013). the model presented here is developed for investigating subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow and the permeability distribution including the fault zones in the lahendong geothermal ﬁeld. below, the geological structure of the ﬁeld is presented followed by an introduction to the modeling approach. detailed investigation of subsurface permeability distribution is a crucial step for site selection and smart drilling strategies. the numerical simulations presented will provide insight into understanding the subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow considering the hydraulic conductivity of faults. it ensures productive as well as sustainable operation of geothermal ﬁelds avoiding risks, such as drilling into non-fractured or cold zones, and targeting highly corroding waters. although the target area is lahendong, the general workﬂow is applicable for other geothermal sites consisting of similar constraints. reservoir characterization hydrogeology the overall driving force for the ﬂuid ﬂow is the sw–ne oriented natural hydraulic gradient in the lahendong geothermal system. the direction of ﬂuid ﬂow varies through the geothermal site due to horizontal partitioning of the reservoir by relatively less permeable fault zones (brehme et al 2014). the basic sections are located in the fig. 1 topographic map of the study area with geological features, water and rock sample locations, and model cross section 123\\x0cenviron earth sci (2016) 75:1088 page 3 of 11 1088 south, in the east, and beneath lake linau. beneath lake linau, the direction of ﬂuid ﬂow is slightly rotated to wsw–ene (fig. 1). also, types of ﬂuid change from one section to another, e.g., an acidic highly saline-type beneath lake linau and a neutral low saline-type south and east of lake linau (fig. 1). the impermeable structure across faults prevent the ﬂuids from diluting each other (brehme et al 2016). however, faults are rather permeable along the vertical axis, which allows recharge of the system through the faults. rainwater inﬁltrates at a fault in the sw, at mt. lengkoan, and creek water inﬁltrates into the normal faults at lake linau (fig. 2). the hydrothermal system discharges into lake linau and toward the ne, as driven by the hydraulic gradient (brehme et al 2014). the fracture network along the area is characterized by strike slip faults and normal faults. the sinistral faults strike n 40° and steeply dip toward the se. left step over on the strike slip faults forms an extension basin in the central study area. normal faults at the extension basin strike nw and dip 70°–80° beneath lake linau (brehme et al 2014). lithology lahendong area is mainly characterized by pre-, post- and tondano formation of plio- to pleistocene age (koestono et al 2010). the rocks are typically andesite, volcanic breccia, and tuff. those types have been sampled from borehole cores and used to determine porosity, permeability, and thermal conductivity. effective porosity and matrix permeability have been analyzed using a cylindrical-shaped specimen with a dimension of 5 cm x 5 cm 9 2.5 cm oriented parallel to the coring (brehme et al 2016). thermal conductivity has been measured on plain sections of dried cores. the experimental setup consists of a gas permeameter for determining matrix permeability (milsch et al 2011), of an helium pycnometry for effective porosity measurements (johnson-maynard et al 1994) and of an optical scanner for thermal conductivity measurements (popov et al 1999). these parameters have been measured and averaged for the three rock types (brehme et al 2016; table 1). andesite has an effective porosity of 3.7 %, a permeability of 2.1 9 10-14 m2, and a thermal conductivity of 1.8 w m-1 k-1 (dry) or 2.2 w m-1 k-1 (saturated). tuff has a porosity of 7.7 % but the lowest permeability of 2.0 9 10-15 m2 of 1.6 w m-1 k-1 (saturated). volcanic breccia is a permeable layer with an effective porosity of 10.5 %, a permeability of 2.3 9 10-14 m2, and a thermal conductivity of 1.6 w m-1 k-1 (dry) or 2.5 w m-1 k-1 (saturated). reservoir

equations for ﬂuid ﬂow and heat transport in saturated porous media are derived from conservation principles of linear momentum, mass, and energy (dhi-wasy 2009). details on the software and the parameterization can be found in diersch (2014). the model geometry is a 2d vertical sw–ne trending cross section extending 6 km in horizontal and 3 km in vertical direction. the direction of the proﬁle has been selected to cover all relevant processes in the lahendong geothermal ﬁeld: it cuts major faults and the production and injection wells, which are used for temperature and pressure calibration. furthermore, to the groundwater ﬂow direction, showing major ﬂuid ﬂow activities. the homogeneous and isotropic geological layers in the model are stratiﬁed nearly horizontally. faults in the middle of the model, striking perpendicular to the cross section, dip with 84° toward a cooling pluton beneath lake linau. details on structural and geological components of the modeled region have been presented in brehme et al (2014). is parallel it the numerical the mesh used for simulation in feflow consists of 45,264 nodes and 89,320 elements that are denser surrounding the faults because of expected gradients due to parameter contrasts. material properties of 123 elements are permeability, porosity, and thermal conductivity and set according to laboratory measurements (table 1). however, properties of the faults and lake linau are slightly adapted to speciﬁc conditions. the definitions for the modeled grids along the faults are as follows: porosity is 30 % and thermal conductivity is 1.8 w m-1 k-1. corresponding grids for lake linau are deﬁned by a porosity of 100 % and a thermal conductivity of 0.6 w m-1 k-1. the model simulates ﬂuid ﬂow and thermal transport in saturated media in steady state. initial values and boundary conditions fluid ﬂow boundary conditions in the model describe groundwater heads and recharge amounts (table 2; fig. 2). the hydraulic head at the sw model boundary is 837 m and 500 m at the ne boundary. the sw hydraulic head represents inﬁltration of surface water into a fault, striking perpendicular to the model. hydraulic head at the ne border is adapted to borehole measurements in that area (brehme et al 2014). inﬁltration into the fault zones at lake linau is described by ﬂuid ﬂux boundary conditions. the quantity is 3.0 9 10-4 m s-1 the sw and 1.3 9 10-6 m s-1 at the ne fault distributed over 40 m fault width. groundwater recharge is set to 412 mm a-1 at the ne top surface (table 2; fig. 2). fluid movement in for\\x0cthe model domain is constrained by no-ﬂow boundary at the bottom, recharge through the surrounding fault zones, and the low hydraulic heads in the ne model area. discharge of the system in the central study area is mainly toward lake linau and across the ne model boundary. initial hydraulic head for the whole model domain is 500 m. the heat is 116 °c km-1 at transport boundary conditions are time-invariant, ﬁxed temperatures, and heat ﬂux (table 2; fig. 2). thermal gradient the sw model boundary, and the temperature is constant 350 °c at the pluton. temperature of water inﬁltrating into faults and here mixing with shallow warm groundwater is 70 °c, while surface groundwater recharge is at 28 °c. temperature values are obtained from ﬁeld and bore log measurements (brehme et al 2014). heat ﬂux is set to 100 mw m-2 at the bottom model boundary (table 2; fig. 2). this value is ﬁxed based on the studies from delisle et al (1998), nagao and uyeda (1995), and neben et al (1998). initial temperature for the model domain is set as 116 °c km-1, according to the local thermal gradient. permeability determination initial values for permeability are deﬁned based on laboratory measurements (table 1). after each simulation run, modeled and measured temperature and pressure values have been compared at indicated observation points. in case of poor matching (errors [10 %), permeability has been adjusted until satisfactory results have been achieved. beneath lake linau, simulation results showed locally strong discrepancies between modeled and measured pressure and temperature (errors [45 %). adjustment of permeability in geological inﬁltration rates into faults, or hydraulic heads did not lead to acceptable results. only the implementation of strong permeability anisotropy throughout whole depth, i.e., an additional fault, resulted in minimization of errors (0–7 %). implementation has been accomplished by mesh adaptation to ensure appropriate behavior around the fault. by this procedure, permeability anisotropies have been located and characterized in detail throughout the model. layers, in general, deﬁning a direction-dependent permeability improves the data ﬁt rather than using similar permeabilities in all directions. this is probably due to the fractures increasing the permeability mostly in vertical direction. porosity and thermal conductivity remained constant throughout simulation. variation in porosity is negligible because it would directly be reﬂected in permeability, while thermal conductivity differences would only affect conductive heat transport, which is not dominant in the lahendong area (ondrak et al 1998; brehme et al 2014). 123 100c measurementa 500borelog ofmodel bottom boundary nemodel

best ﬁt to the measured data changing the absolute and relative permeability in geological elements. relative permeability refers to different permeabilities in horizontal and vertical direction. as a main result, a blind fault has been recognized beneath lake linau, which has not been known from former studies. simulated pressure and temperature are measured at ﬁve selected observation points, which represent boreholes with available bore logs for pressure and temperature. details on data are given in fig. 6. the model with best data ﬁt, out of 370 different models, is considered to generate the ﬁnal model developed for lahendong. permeability distribution and identiﬁcation of a blind fault distribution of permeability patterns in the reservoir has been conceived comparing temperature and pressure data in several wells. especially beneath lake linau, closely located wells show high variations in temperature and pressure. a drop of 100 °c and 18 bar along 300 m distance has been observed between well lhd 24 and lhd 28. models ﬁrst showed high discrepancies between modeled and measured values in this area. however, after implementing another high anisotropic permeable structure between the observation points, models resulted in satisfactory results. the structure has ten times higher vertical environ earth sci (2016) 75:1088 permeability than horizontal permeability. this structure is assumed to be another fault zone located between two known faults with vertical dip and nw strike. this fault shows no trace at surface, because it is covered by lake linau. generally, modeled permeability distribution in the lahendong reservoir is direction-dependent and overprints the lithology. modeled permeability is generally higher than measured ones in the order of up to four magnitudes. this is due to fracture patterns, which are not detectable at core-sample scale. permeability patterns directly affect subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow and temperature and pressure distribution. permeability in the faulted zones and surroundings is lowest in the study area. especially the middle and ne fault, the shallow area beneath sw lake linau and the deep ne section of the ne fault show low permeabilities between 10-13 and 10-14 m2 (fig. 3). the area between the middle and ne fault, the deep section ne of the sw fault, the sw fault itself and the whole model area toward the sw and ne boundary show higher permeabilities of 10-10 and 10-12 m2 (fig. 3). permeability varies not only within the modeled area, but also in vertical and horizontal direction. in faults and the deep reservoir section in the ne, permeability is by a factor of 10 higher in the vertical direction than in the horizontal direction (fig. 3). in the areas between faults, permeability is in some parts by a factor of 10–100 lower in the vertical direction. in the rest of the model, vertical and horizontal permeability do not differ (fig. 3). fig. 3 final adapted permeability and anisotropy

elevations in the sw. some wells existing in this region are of artesian-type. overpressure releases through high permeable zones beneath lake linau and discharges toward surface. the pressure drop is up to 20 bars across the faults (fig. 4). temperature distribution temperature distribution along the lahendong geothermal reservoir suggests that convective heat transport is the dominating process in the reservoir rocks. isotherms generally follow the sw–ne oriented ﬂow pattern, the rise and the inﬁltration of ﬂuids. upwelling of isotherms between the faults veriﬁes water rise toward lake linau. inﬁltration of cold water causes down welling of isotherms particularly on the northeast section of the model. temperature is locally increased at the bottom of the model surrounding the pluton (fig. 4). subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow the absolute and horizontal/vertical permeability distribution controls local ﬂuid ﬂow in the lahendong reservoir. the general ﬂuid ﬂow, driven by the natural pressure gradient, is oriented from sw to ne. vertical inﬁltration occurs at faults at lake linau and at the sw boundary. discharge is across the ne model boundary (fig. 5). the more detailed ﬂow patterns can be observed with streamlines, which show a ﬂuid ﬂow along highly permeable areas. calculated streamlines describe particle ﬂow within the model domain. a forward calculation shows how inﬁltrating water at the sw model boundary distributes through the reservoir. the backward calculation shows the source of ﬂuid particles arriving at the ne model boundary (fig. 5). patterns show that hot groundwater ﬂows toward the faults beneath lake linau, where the ﬂuid ﬂow is disturbed by a rise in temperature and vertically high permeable layers. this causes a rise of groundwater in this model area (red forward streamlines in fig. 5). at the same time, cold water inﬁltrates into high permeable areas and distributes over the ne model domain (blue backward streamlines in fig. 5). it is clearly seen that the composition of the ne reservoir domain is dominated by coldwater inﬁltration into faults, while the production areas are characterized by hot water ﬂow (fig. 5). discussion investigation of subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow in geothermal reservoirs is crucial for sustainable exploitation avoiding drilling into less productive areas. subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow might be locally inﬂuenced by fault zones or physical 123\\x0c1088 page 8 of 11 environ earth sci (2016) 75:1088 fig. 5 model domain with calculated streamlines, in red: forward streamlines follow hydraulic gradient from sw model boundary towards ne, in blue: backward streamlines representing inﬁltrating cold water ﬂowing towards ne model boundary properties of water (i.e. viscosity). the inﬂuence of these parameters on the ﬂuid ﬂow has been investigated in lahendong geothermal reservoir using hydraulic–thermal simulations. simulation results show the detailed permeability distribution in the reservoir including location of an additional fault zone. matching of measured and simulated temperature and pressure has been used as a tool for resolving the permeability distribution. temperature and pressure have been iteratively determined at several observation points (fig. 2). generally, modeled values are in good agreement with observed ones (fig. 6). nevertheless, some observation points give slightly different values for both pressure and temperature (lhd 4 and lhd 7) or only temperature (lhd 24). this is probably due to the complicated ﬂow processes or strong small-scale structural variation in fractured and faulted areas. furthermore, density variations, which could have not been included into simulation due to high temperatures, could cause variation of ﬂuid pressure. however, the average deviation of simulated pressure and temperature is 1 %. implemented model parameters are porosity, permeability, and heat conductivity. from those parameters, only permeability has been tested in a speciﬁc range during simulation. the inﬂuence of porosity and heat conductivity on ﬂuid ﬂow is negligible due to dominating convective heat ﬂow (ondrak et al 1998). values implemented in the model are based on measured permeabilities, which represent matrix permeability of rocks. the measured matrix permeability, representing permeability in horizontal direction, is 1.5 9 10-14 m2 on 123 average, which remains within typical permeability range for fractured igneous rocks (scho¨n 2004). permeability for volcanic breccias ranges typically between 3 9 10-15 and 5 9 10-12 m2 and tuff permeabilities range between 7 9 10-17 and 7 9 10-12 m2 (klavetter and peters 1987). in the wairakei geothermal ﬁeld, simulating the impermeable layers resulted in permeabilities of 10-18 and 10-14 m2, in horizontal and vertical axis, respectively (mercer and faust 1979). however, permeability in reservoir rocks might be locally increased due to fracture formation. it might also be decreased due to alteration and sealing in faults. in lahendong, modeled permeability can be up to four magnitudes higher than measured ones in faulted areas. this is caused by fractures, which are not detectable in core scale. moreover, in fault cores, it is by a factor of 10 higher in vertical direction than in horizontal direction. however, in areas between faults (fault gauge), permeability is in some parts by a factor of 10–100 lower in the vertical direction. adaptation of permeability ensures a ﬁt to measured temperature and pressure data. permeability in fractured areas is the main factor inﬂuencing subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow and temperature distribution in the lahendong reservoir area. subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow is driven by local hydraulic heads, which show high variations at different sections of the study area. consequently, convective heat distribution leads to high temperature variation along the reservoir. these phenomena are observed in lahendong as well as comparable ﬁelds. in new mexico, water level drops of 30–100 m are observed across (haneberg 1995). high several fault zones\\x0c123 environ earth sci (2016) 75:1088 page 9 of 11 1088 7 24 4 28 5 well name lhd 4 lhd 5 lhd 7

from brehme et al (2014) temperature drops and upwelling of isotherms indicate that fault zones control the ﬂuid ﬂow in the lake long and valentine ﬁelds, usa (hooper 1991). the analysis of ﬂuid pressure differences at the alpine fault, new zealand, allowed to characterize the change in permeability between hanging and footwall blocks (sutherland et al 2012). in summary, high pressure or temperature gradients are indicators for ﬂuid barriers between observation points. in other words, reservoir sections of different properties are separated by horizontally less permeable faults. in lahendong, most signiﬁcant ﬂuid barriers are faults to the sw and to the ne of lake linau. across these barriers, the pressure drops up to 20 bars. a similar pattern has been measured in bore logs beneath lake linau, where no surface trace of a fault had been observed in former studies. however, only by implementing another fault, modeled and measured values could have been adapted. the recently identiﬁed fault zone beneath lake linau remains under lake water and therefore is only traceable by this kind of reservoir modeling. additionally to fault identiﬁcation, the internal structure of known fault zones has been understood in detail. the ne fault, i.e., shows a displacement at 2 km depth. the detailed trend has been understood by permeability adaptation in this area. due to low permeability in horizontal direction in the faults, ﬂuids propagate mostly vertically toward the hot springs at surface. it also allows surface water to inﬁltrate into the reservoir in case the pressure within the fault zone is low enough (fig. 5). this vertical ﬂuid movement eventually controls the temperature distribution in the reservoir. upward migration of deep hot water increases the temperature, while inﬁltration of cold surface water causes local drop of temperature. in summary, the most important factors inﬂuencing the reliability of numerical reservoir models are absolute and different horizontal and vertical permeability. however, a permeability adaptation has been done for each geological layer; the vertical permeability anomalies are overprinting those layers and are constraining the regional groundwater ﬂow. those permeabilities of fractures directly inﬂuence the productivity of the reservoir (cherubini et al 2013). therefore, their permeability characteristics should be investigated in detail. in a previous study, a numerical model for the lahendong site has been set up in tough2 and aimed at forecasting the reservoir behavior during exploitation until the year 2036. with a production of 60 mwe, it predicts a pressure drop of 10 bars. however, the forecast results are uncertain due to lack of measured pressure draw down data (yani 2006). accordingly, the next steps of the presented study should include a realistic production and injection scenario in order reservoir exploitation. furthermore, chemical characteristics could be considered to achieve reliable production setups, because hydrochemical processes play an important role in the lahendong reservoir (brehme et al 2016). presented models from this study provide important information on ﬂuid ﬂow in the water-dominated lahendong reservoir. however, additional the two-phase ﬂow models of to support sustainable\\x0c1088 page 10 of 11 environ earth sci (2016) 75:1088 lahendong area are in progress to understand the inﬂuence of steam driven ﬂuid ﬂow in this high-temperature system. conclusion the primary focus of this study is to understand the inﬂuence of fault zones and permeability patterns on subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow in geothermal reservoirs. the ﬂuid ﬂow mainly depends on rock and fault zone permeability. these processes have been considered in numerical models, which simulate local temperature and pressure conditions. the initial reservoir conditions, which refers to the case before production starts. models are developed based on the conceptual models of the study area, which explain reservoir geometry, geological structures, temperature, and hydraulic conditions. temperature and pressure well-logs have been used for model calibration. the numerical models represent vertical and horizontal ﬂuid ﬂow is mainly controlled by fault permeability. this characteristic is used to simulate different reservoir sections, and vertical ﬂuid rise toward the surface. by stepwise adaptation of permeability ﬁelds, based on observed temperature and pressure gradients, an additional blind fault zone can be identiﬁed beneath lake linau. temperature and pressure signiﬁcantly drop across that ﬂuid barrier. this behavior has been observed in comparable ﬁelds in the usa as well. the overall shape of ﬂuid ﬂow direction trends in a sw–ne direction. main recharge occurs by inﬁltration of surface water into the faults, especially in the southwest and near to lake linau. discharge is enhanced in highly fractured areas toward lake linau. vertical permeability of faults allows ﬂuids rising toward the hot springs at surface. results show that permeability has to be considered for simulation of a geothermal system. the geothermal system is mainly controlled by ﬂuid ﬂow in fractures/faults depending on temperature and pressure conditions. the locally modiﬁed ﬂuid ﬂow can considerably inﬂuence the productivity of a geothermal ﬁeld. results also guide reservoir management in case of a potential for ﬁeld extension, as performed in lahendong. acknowledgments the authors acknowledge the continuous support within the team of

brehme et al , , , ; wiegand et al ). the model presented here is developed for investigating subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow and the permeability distribution including the fault zones in the lahendong geothermal ﬁeld. below, the geological structure of the ﬁeld is presented followed by an introduction to the modeling approach. detailed investigation of subsurface permeability distribution is a crucial step for site selection and smart drilling strategies. the numerical simulations presented will provide insight into understanding the subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow considering the hydraulic conductivity of faults. it ensures productive as well as sustainable operation of geothermal ﬁelds avoiding risks, such as drilling into non-fractured or cold zones, and targeting highly corroding waters. although the target area is lahendong, the general workﬂow is applicable for other geothermal sites consisting of similar constraints. reservoir characterization hydrogeology the overall driving force for the ﬂuid ﬂow is the sw–ne oriented natural hydraulic gradient in the lahendong geothermal system. the direction of ﬂuid ﬂow varies through the geothermal site due to horizontal partitioning of the reservoir by relatively less permeable fault zones (brehme et al ). the basic sections are located in the fig.  topographic map of the study area with geological features, water and rock sample locations, and model cross section \\x0cenviron earth sci () : page  of   south, in the east, and beneath lake linau. beneath lake linau, the direction of ﬂuid ﬂow is slightly rotated to wsw–ene (fig. ). also, types of ﬂuid change from one section to another, e.g., an acidic highly saline-type beneath lake linau and a neutral low saline-type south and east of lake linau (fig. ). the impermeable structure across faults prevent the ﬂuids from diluting each other (brehme et al ). however, faults are rather permeable along the vertical axis, which allows recharge of the system through the faults. rainwater inﬁltrates at a fault in the sw, at mt. lengkoan, and creek water inﬁltrates into the normal faults at lake linau (fig. ). the hydrothermal system discharges into lake linau and toward the ne, as driven by the hydraulic gradient (brehme et al ). the fracture network along the area is characterized by strike slip faults and normal faults. the sinistral faults strike n ° and steeply dip toward the se. left step over on the strike slip faults forms an extension basin in the central study area. normal faults at the extension basin strike nw and dip °–° beneath lake linau (brehme et al ). lithology lahendong area is mainly characterized by pre-, post- and tondano formation of plio- to pleistocene age (koestono et al ). the rocks are typically andesite, volcanic breccia, and tuff. those types have been sampled from borehole cores and used to determine porosity, permeability, and thermal conductivity. effective porosity and matrix permeability have been analyzed using a cylindrical-shaped specimen with a dimension of  cm x  cm  . cm oriented parallel to the coring (brehme et al ). thermal conductivity has been measured on plain sections of dried cores. the experimental setup consists of a gas permeameter for determining matrix permeability (milsch et al ), of an helium pycnometry for effective porosity measurements (johnson-maynard et al ) and of an optical scanner for thermal conductivity measurements (popov et al ). these parameters have been measured and averaged for the three rock types (brehme et al ; table ). andesite has an effective porosity of . %, a permeability of .  - m, and a thermal conductivity of . w m- k- (dry) or . w m- k- (saturated). tuff has a porosity of . % but the lowest permeability of .  - m of . w m- k- (saturated). volcanic breccia is a permeable layer with an effective porosity of . %, a permeability of .  - m, and a thermal conductivity of . w m- k- (dry) or . w m- k- (saturated). reservoir rocks reﬂect generally low matrix permeability suggesting fracture-controlled ﬂuid ﬂow throughout the aquifer (brehme et al ). and (dry) or . w m- k- a thermal conductivity model setup model geometry numerical models developed for the study area represent the initial conditions of the reservoir before production or the commercial ﬁnite injection start. for simulation, fig.  cross section of the modeled area with geological structure, boundary conditions, and location of observation points \\x0c page  of  environ earth sci () : table  thermal and hydraulic parameters of the lahendong reservoir rocks measured in laboratory (brehme et al ) sample (name, depth) rock type effective porosity (%) thermal conductivity dry (w m- k-) thermal conductivity saturated (w m- k-) matrix permeability (m) lhd – lhd – lhd – lhd – lhd – lhd – lhd – lhd – lhd – lhd – lhd – lhd – lhd – lhd – lhd – lhd –, lhd .– lhd – average values a b t t a b b a b a b a a a a a t b andesite (a) breccia (b) tuff (t) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

to model pressuredriven and thermally induced ﬂuid ﬂow including viscosity changes. governing equations for ﬂuid ﬂow and heat transport in saturated porous media are derived from conservation principles of linear momentum, mass, and energy (dhi-wasy ). details on the software and the parameterization can be found in diersch (). the model geometry is a d vertical sw–ne trending cross section extending  km in horizontal and  km in vertical direction. the direction of the proﬁle has been selected to cover all relevant processes in the lahendong geothermal ﬁeld: it cuts major faults and the production and injection wells, which are used for temperature and pressure calibration. furthermore, to the groundwater ﬂow direction, showing major ﬂuid ﬂow activities. the homogeneous and isotropic geological layers in the model are stratiﬁed nearly horizontally. faults in the middle of the model, striking perpendicular to the cross section, dip with ° toward a cooling pluton beneath lake linau. details on structural and geological components of the modeled region have been presented in brehme et al (). is parallel it the numerical the mesh used for simulation in feflow consists of , nodes and , elements that are denser surrounding the faults because of expected gradients due to parameter contrasts. material properties of  elements are permeability, porosity, and thermal conductivity and set according to laboratory measurements (table ). however, properties of the faults and lake linau are slightly adapted to speciﬁc conditions. the definitions for the modeled grids along the faults are as follows: porosity is  % and thermal conductivity is . w m- k-. corresponding grids for lake linau are deﬁned by a porosity of  % and a thermal conductivity of . w m- k-. the model simulates ﬂuid ﬂow and thermal transport in saturated media in steady state. initial values and boundary conditions fluid ﬂow boundary conditions in the model describe groundwater heads and recharge amounts (table ; fig. ). the hydraulic head at the sw model boundary is  m and  m at the ne boundary. the sw hydraulic head represents inﬁltration of surface water into a fault, striking perpendicular to the model. hydraulic head at the ne border is adapted to borehole measurements in that area (brehme et al ). inﬁltration into the fault zones at lake linau is described by ﬂuid ﬂux boundary conditions. the quantity is .  - m s- the sw and .  - m s- at the ne fault distributed over  m fault width. groundwater recharge is set to  mm a- at the ne top surface (table ; fig. ). fluid movement in for\\x0cthe model domain is constrained by no-ﬂow boundary at the bottom, recharge through the surrounding fault zones, and the low hydraulic heads in the ne model area. discharge of the system in the central study area is mainly toward lake linau and across the ne model boundary. initial hydraulic head for the whole model domain is  m. the heat is  °c km- at transport boundary conditions are time-invariant, ﬁxed temperatures, and heat ﬂux (table ; fig. ). thermal gradient the sw model boundary, and the temperature is constant  °c at the pluton. temperature of water inﬁltrating into faults and here mixing with shallow warm groundwater is  °c, while surface groundwater recharge is at  °c. temperature values are obtained from ﬁeld and bore log measurements (brehme et al ). heat ﬂux is set to  mw m- at the bottom model boundary (table ; fig. ). this value is ﬁxed based on the studies from delisle et al (), nagao and uyeda (), and neben et al (). initial temperature for the model domain is set as  °c km-, according to the local thermal gradient. permeability determination initial values for permeability are deﬁned based on laboratory measurements (table ). after each simulation run, modeled and measured temperature and pressure values have been compared at indicated observation points. in case of poor matching (errors [ %), permeability has been adjusted until satisfactory results have been achieved. beneath lake linau, simulation results showed locally strong discrepancies between modeled and measured pressure and temperature (errors [ %). adjustment of permeability in geological inﬁltration rates into faults, or hydraulic heads did not lead to acceptable results. only the implementation of strong permeability anisotropy throughout whole depth, i.e., an additional fault, resulted in minimization of errors (– %). implementation has been accomplished by mesh adaptation to ensure appropriate behavior around the fault. by this procedure, permeability anisotropies have been located and characterized in detail throughout the model. layers, in general, deﬁning a direction-dependent permeability improves the data ﬁt rather than using similar permeabilities in all directions. this is probably due to the fractures increasing the permeability mostly in vertical direction. porosity and thermal conductivity remained constant throughout simulation. variation in porosity is negligible because it would directly be reﬂected in permeability, while thermal conductivity differences would only affect conductive heat transport, which is not dominant in the lahendong area (ondrak et al ; brehme et al ).  c measurementa borelog ofmodel bottom boundary nemodel cdelisleetal.(),nagaoanduyeda(),nebenetal.()

simulation is performed to obtain the best ﬁt to the measured data changing the absolute and relative permeability in geological elements. relative permeability refers to different permeabilities in horizontal and vertical direction. as a main result, a blind fault has been recognized beneath lake linau, which has not been known from former studies. simulated pressure and temperature are measured at ﬁve selected observation points, which represent boreholes with available bore logs for pressure and temperature. details on data are given in fig. . the model with best data ﬁt, out of  different models, is considered to generate the ﬁnal model developed for lahendong. permeability distribution and identiﬁcation of a blind fault distribution of permeability patterns in the reservoir has been conceived comparing temperature and pressure data in several wells. especially beneath lake linau, closely located wells show high variations in temperature and pressure. a drop of  °c and  bar along  m distance has been observed between well lhd  and lhd . models ﬁrst showed high discrepancies between modeled and measured values in this area. however, after implementing another high anisotropic permeable structure between the observation points, models resulted in satisfactory results. the structure has ten times higher vertical environ earth sci () : permeability than horizontal permeability. this structure is assumed to be another fault zone located between two known faults with vertical dip and nw strike. this fault shows no trace at surface, because it is covered by lake linau. generally, modeled permeability distribution in the lahendong reservoir is direction-dependent and overprints the lithology. modeled permeability is generally higher than measured ones in the order of up to four magnitudes. this is due to fracture patterns, which are not detectable at core-sample scale. permeability patterns directly affect subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow and temperature and pressure distribution. permeability in the faulted zones and surroundings is lowest in the study area. especially the middle and ne fault, the shallow area beneath sw lake linau and the deep ne section of the ne fault show low permeabilities between - and - m (fig. ). the area between the middle and ne fault, the deep section ne of the sw fault, the sw fault itself and the whole model area toward the sw and ne boundary show higher permeabilities of - and - m (fig. ). permeability varies not only within the modeled area, but also in vertical and horizontal direction. in faults and the deep reservoir section in the ne, permeability is by a factor of  higher in the vertical direction than in the horizontal direction (fig. ). in the areas between faults, permeability is in some parts by a factor of – lower in the vertical direction. in the rest of the model, vertical and horizontal permeability do not differ (fig. ). fig.  final adapted permeability and anisotropy distribution throughout the

following the natural hydraulic gradient from sw to ne. the sw section of the system shows higher pressures, which is caused by inﬁltration from higher elevations in the sw. some wells existing in this region are of artesian-type. overpressure releases through high permeable zones beneath lake linau and discharges toward surface. the pressure drop is up to  bars across the faults (fig. ). temperature distribution temperature distribution along the lahendong geothermal reservoir suggests that convective heat transport is the dominating process in the reservoir rocks. isotherms generally follow the sw–ne oriented ﬂow pattern, the rise and the inﬁltration of ﬂuids. upwelling of isotherms between the faults veriﬁes water rise toward lake linau. inﬁltration of cold water causes down welling of isotherms particularly on the northeast section of the model. temperature is locally increased at the bottom of the model surrounding the pluton (fig. ). subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow the absolute and horizontal/vertical permeability distribution controls local ﬂuid ﬂow in the lahendong reservoir. the general ﬂuid ﬂow, driven by the natural pressure gradient, is oriented from sw to ne. vertical inﬁltration occurs at faults at lake linau and at the sw boundary. discharge is across the ne model boundary (fig. ). the more detailed ﬂow patterns can be observed with streamlines, which show a ﬂuid ﬂow along highly permeable areas. calculated streamlines describe particle ﬂow within the model domain. a forward calculation shows how inﬁltrating water at the sw model boundary distributes through the reservoir. the backward calculation shows the source of ﬂuid particles arriving at the ne model boundary (fig. ). patterns show that hot groundwater ﬂows toward the faults beneath lake linau, where the ﬂuid ﬂow is disturbed by a rise in temperature and vertically high permeable layers. this causes a rise of groundwater in this model area (red forward streamlines in fig. ). at the same time, cold water inﬁltrates into high permeable areas and distributes over the ne model domain (blue backward streamlines in fig. ). it is clearly seen that the composition of the ne reservoir domain is dominated by coldwater inﬁltration into faults, while the production areas are characterized by hot water ﬂow (fig. ). discussion investigation of subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow in geothermal reservoirs is crucial for sustainable exploitation avoiding drilling into less productive areas. subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow might be locally inﬂuenced by fault zones or physical \\x0c page  of  environ earth sci () : fig.  model domain with calculated streamlines, in red: forward streamlines follow hydraulic gradient from sw model boundary towards ne, in blue: backward streamlines representing inﬁltrating cold water ﬂowing towards ne model boundary properties of water (i.e. viscosity). the inﬂuence of these parameters on the ﬂuid ﬂow has been investigated in lahendong geothermal reservoir using hydraulic–thermal simulations. simulation results show the detailed permeability distribution in the reservoir including location of an additional fault zone. matching of measured and simulated temperature and pressure has been used as a tool for resolving the permeability distribution. temperature and pressure have been iteratively determined at several observation points (fig. ). generally, modeled values are in good agreement with observed ones (fig. ). nevertheless, some observation points give slightly different values for both pressure and temperature (lhd  and lhd ) or only temperature (lhd ). this is probably due to the complicated ﬂow processes or strong small-scale structural variation in fractured and faulted areas. furthermore, density variations, which could have not been included into simulation due to high temperatures, could cause variation of ﬂuid pressure. however, the average deviation of simulated pressure and temperature is  %. implemented model parameters are porosity, permeability, and heat conductivity. from those parameters, only permeability has been tested in a speciﬁc range during simulation. the inﬂuence of porosity and heat conductivity on ﬂuid ﬂow is negligible due to dominating convective heat ﬂow (ondrak et al ). values implemented in the model are based on measured permeabilities, which represent matrix permeability of rocks. the measured matrix permeability, representing permeability in horizontal direction, is .  - m on  average, which remains within typical permeability range for fractured igneous rocks (scho¨n ). permeability for volcanic breccias ranges typically between   - and   - m and tuff permeabilities range between   - and   - m (klavetter and peters ). in the wairakei geothermal ﬁeld, simulating the impermeable layers resulted in permeabilities of - and - m, in horizontal and vertical axis, respectively (mercer and faust ). however, permeability in reservoir rocks might be locally increased due to fracture formation. it might also be decreased due to alteration and sealing in faults. in lahendong, modeled permeability can be up to four magnitudes higher than measured ones in faulted areas. this is caused by fractures, which are not detectable in core scale. moreover, in fault cores, it is by a factor of  higher in vertical direction than in horizontal direction. however, in areas between faults (fault gauge), permeability is in some parts by a factor of – lower in the vertical direction. adaptation of permeability ensures a ﬁt to measured temperature and pressure data. permeability in fractured areas is the main factor inﬂuencing subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow and temperature distribution in the lahendong reservoir area. subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow is driven by local hydraulic heads, which show high variations at different sections of the study area. consequently, convective heat distribution leads to high temperature variation along the reservoir. these phenomena are observed in lahendong as well as comparable ﬁelds. in new mexico, water level drops of – m are observed across (haneberg ). high several fault zones\\x0c environ earth sci () : page  of        well name lhd  lhd  lhd  lhd

points. well speciﬁcations and measured data from brehme et al () temperature drops and upwelling of isotherms indicate that fault zones control the ﬂuid ﬂow in the lake long and valentine ﬁelds, usa (hooper ). the analysis of ﬂuid pressure differences at the alpine fault, new zealand, allowed to characterize the change in permeability between hanging and footwall blocks (sutherland et al ). in summary, high pressure or temperature gradients are indicators for ﬂuid barriers between observation points. in other words, reservoir sections of different properties are separated by horizontally less permeable faults. in lahendong, most signiﬁcant ﬂuid barriers are faults to the sw and to the ne of lake linau. across these barriers, the pressure drops up to  bars. a similar pattern has been measured in bore logs beneath lake linau, where no surface trace of a fault had been observed in former studies. however, only by implementing another fault, modeled and measured values could have been adapted. the recently identiﬁed fault zone beneath lake linau remains under lake water and therefore is only traceable by this kind of reservoir modeling. additionally to fault identiﬁcation, the internal structure of known fault zones has been understood in detail. the ne fault, i.e., shows a displacement at  km depth. the detailed trend has been understood by permeability adaptation in this area. due to low permeability in horizontal direction in the faults, ﬂuids propagate mostly vertically toward the hot springs at surface. it also allows surface water to inﬁltrate into the reservoir in case the pressure within the fault zone is low enough (fig. ). this vertical ﬂuid movement eventually controls the temperature distribution in the reservoir. upward migration of deep hot water increases the temperature, while inﬁltration of cold surface water causes local drop of temperature. in summary, the most important factors inﬂuencing the reliability of numerical reservoir models are absolute and different horizontal and vertical permeability. however, a permeability adaptation has been done for each geological layer; the vertical permeability anomalies are overprinting those layers and are constraining the regional groundwater ﬂow. those permeabilities of fractures directly inﬂuence the productivity of the reservoir (cherubini et al ). therefore, their permeability characteristics should be investigated in detail. in a previous study, a numerical model for the lahendong site has been set up in tough and aimed at forecasting the reservoir behavior during exploitation until the year . with a production of  mwe, it predicts a pressure drop of  bars. however, the forecast results are uncertain due to lack of measured pressure draw down data (yani ). accordingly, the next steps of the presented study should include a realistic production and injection scenario in order reservoir exploitation. furthermore, chemical characteristics could be considered to achieve reliable production setups, because hydrochemical processes play an important role in the lahendong reservoir (brehme et al ). presented models from this study provide important information on ﬂuid ﬂow in the water-dominated lahendong reservoir. however, additional the two-phase ﬂow models of to support sustainable\\x0c page  of  environ earth sci () : lahendong area are in progress to understand the inﬂuence of steam driven ﬂuid ﬂow in this high-temperature system. conclusion the primary focus of this study is to understand the inﬂuence of fault zones and permeability patterns on subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow in geothermal reservoirs. the ﬂuid ﬂow mainly depends on rock and fault zone permeability. these processes have been considered in numerical models, which simulate local temperature and pressure conditions. the initial reservoir conditions, which refers to the case before production starts. models are developed based on the conceptual models of the study area, which explain reservoir geometry, geological structures, temperature, and hydraulic conditions. temperature and pressure well-logs have been used for model calibration. the numerical models represent vertical and horizontal ﬂuid ﬂow is mainly controlled by fault permeability. this characteristic is used to simulate different reservoir sections, and vertical ﬂuid rise toward the surface. by stepwise adaptation of permeability ﬁelds, based on observed temperature and pressure gradients, an additional blind fault zone can be identiﬁed beneath lake linau. temperature and pressure signiﬁcantly drop across that ﬂuid barrier. this behavior has been observed in comparable ﬁelds in the usa as well. the overall shape of ﬂuid ﬂow direction trends in a sw–ne direction. main recharge occurs by inﬁltration of surface water into the faults, especially in the southwest and near to lake linau. discharge is enhanced in highly fractured areas toward lake linau. vertical permeability of faults allows ﬂuids rising toward the hot springs at surface. results show that permeability has to be considered for simulation of a geothermal system. the geothermal system is mainly controlled by ﬂuid ﬂow in fractures/faults depending on temperature and pressure conditions. the locally modiﬁed ﬂuid ﬂow can considerably inﬂuence the productivity of a geothermal ﬁeld. results also guide reservoir management in case of a potential for ﬁeld extension, as performed in lahendong. acknowledgments the authors acknowledge the continuous support within the team of the international center
